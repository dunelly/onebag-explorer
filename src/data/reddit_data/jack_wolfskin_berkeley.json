                "body": "This bag is meant to be my jack of all trades kind of bags. A dad bag. Functional.  \n\nEver since having a kid, I find myself taking more and more items with me each time I leave the house. (Extra clothing, hand sanitizer, wipes, tissues, snacks, jackets, gloves, drinks, diapers, small first aid items, etc.) And that‚Äôs before I include any of my own edc items.  \nI‚Äôve made due for years with some other packs I already have around (Burton Tinder tote, generic Fanny pack, Jack Wolfskin Berkeley) but have been looking for something a bit more sharp/sophisticated yet practical and home both in the city/traveling/ and the outdoors.  This appears to check many of my boxes and I like the expansion ability of the rolltop without there being too many external straps.\n\nMainly (and for the money) I need for it to hold up from a quality perspective and to be effectively utilitarian in its function.\n    \n\nI ordered one last week, and it arrived with the bags back padding oddly creased/kinked/folded and bulging in the middle. My first impressions of the bag were very positive but this small damage/defect slightly undermined my confidence in the products.\n/materials.  \n\nI ordered another (will return the first one) from the same retailer and the crease is not present, though a small bulge is vaguely showing in the new bag in the same location.   \nUnexpectedly, the replacement pack also had slightly different components/features, such as an additional external tripod/hiking pole strap, and slightly different buckles, size straps, as well as small additions like leather reinforcements around the hook straps, and fleece lining on the tablet sleeve, the original bag did not have. The material felt slightly different, and the back padding was slightly different.  \nI am presuming this is actually a newer/updated model as things like the leather reinforcements would logically be in response to typical wear points on the bag.   \nHowever I have not been able to verify anything on different versions existing and the retailer mentions no distinction anyone on the listing or website.",

The straps start practically touching meaning they really pinch the traps, enough so I had to return it. But everything else about the bag is amazing and I was so close to keeping it and sending it to tailor to undo the straps and move them further apart.",
