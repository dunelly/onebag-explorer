Super easy to rip the top open and center zip makes it easy to quickly get to bottom of bag without guessing which side my ish is hiding. Comfy but maybe not as life changing some claim about MR harnesses.  And MR’s 500d coyote looks fantastic.\n\nLOADOUT\n\nMain pocket:\n- 14” laptop\n- 1” file folder\n- Evergoods cap2l\n- Small tool pouch\n- A5 notebook\n- Camelbak chute mag 750ml\n\nQuick access pocket\n- Work phone\n- Key bundle\n- Earbuds\n- Compact tissue pack\n\nInner pockets:\n- Alcohol wipes\n- Pocket notebook\n- Packable travel hand towel\n- Packable shopping bag\n- Protein bar\n- hand salve\n- lip balm\n\nLemme say it first, i freakin love the tri-zip! MR’s option of top access and center access just makes sense to me. I'm usually commuting in a tight subway or bus to surprisingly tighter confines of various coworking spaces, and being able to open or rather RIP OPEN the top is really handy and kinda fun. Nevermind, the triangular wedge shape just lends itself to this design and method: genius.\n\nAnd if i wanna find something in the bottom, the center zip lets me get to either side of the bag, while keeping other items above from spilling out. With a clamshell, i’d have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct side the item in question decided to hide and most times i chose poorly.\n\nMy only real prob is the lack of a place to put my pen or sharpie. But i made due by just clipping them to the end of the laptop strap, wrapping the velcro around them, and letting them dangle in the bag. Actually been kinda helpful, cause i can just tug on the strap and quickly fish out the pen from the bag.\n\nDo i need an outer water bottle pocket? Not really. Grabbing it either top side or from the center zip has worked fine for me. And id rather keep it hidden away from random subway drips, random coughs, and whatever else the city wants to randomly dribble on it.\n\nIn conclusion, does it remind me of the flux capacitor? Yes.",

            "body": "TLDR: the tri-zip is my JAM, prefer it way over the ol’ clamshell. Super easy to rip the top open and center zip makes it easy to quickly get to bottom of bag without guessing which side my ish is hiding. Comfy but maybe not as life changing some claim about MR harnesses.  And MR’s 500d coyote looks fantastic.\n\nLOADOUT\n\nMain pocket:\n- 14” laptop\n- 1” file folder\n- Evergoods cap2l\n- Small tool pouch\n- A5 notebook\n- Camelbak chute mag 750ml\n\nQuick access pocket\n- Work phone\n- Key bundle\n- Earbuds\n- Compact tissue pack\n\nInner pockets:\n- Alcohol wipes\n- Pocket notebook\n- Packable travel hand towel\n- Packable shopping bag\n- Protein bar\n- hand salve\n- lip balm\n\nLemme say it first, i freakin love the tri-zip! MR’s option of top access and center access just makes sense to me. I'm usually commuting in a tight subway or bus to surprisingly tighter confines of various coworking spaces, and being able to open or rather RIP OPEN the top is really handy and kinda fun. Nevermind, the triangular wedge shape just lends itself to this design and method: genius.\n\nAnd if i wanna find something in the bottom, the center zip lets me get to either side of the bag, while keeping other items above from spilling out. With a clamshell, i’d have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct side the item in question decided to hide and most times i chose poorly.\n\nMy only real prob is the lack of a place to put my pen or sharpie. But i made due by just clipping them to the end of the laptop strap, wrapping the velcro around them, and letting them dangle in the bag. Actually been kinda helpful, cause i can just tug on the strap and quickly fish out the pen from the bag.\n\nDo i need an outer water bottle pocket? Not really. Grabbing it either top side or from the center zip has worked fine for me. And id rather keep it hidden away from random subway drips, random coughs, and whatever else the city wants to randomly dribble on it.\n\nIn conclusion, does it remind me of the flux capacitor? Yes.",

            "author": "SaltyMargaritas",
            "body": "**Materials and overall look**\n\nFor a while I've been a proud owner of Mystery Ranch's Urban Assault 21, which is a highly recommended bag on this subreddit. The colorway is called Wood Waxed, which is soft to the touch and has an unassuming rustic look. According to Mystery Ranch on their website, the Wood Waxed UA21's material is a \"polyester blend with a Polyurethane based coating on it.\" It certainly feels much like a waxed canvas bag and scratching it will leave little white marks on the material, so it develops a patina with everyday use. The material feels quite pleasant to interact with actually and oddly reminds me of velvet.\n\n**Organization and tri-zip design**\n\nI purchased the bag because I sometimes take weekend getaway trips with my wife and my other smaller backpacks don't cut it when I need to bring a change of clothes, toiletries and some other stuff with me. The UA21 comes with a solid harness system and Mystery Ranch's intuitive tri-zip design which allows me to open up the whole main compartment. This makes the bag easy to pack without leaving any empty space between items. However, I've been using it as an everyday bag as well to experience how it wears and breaks in. It has served me really well as an EDC bag and despite its simple-looking exterior, it offers some solid organization. When I use the UA21 as an EDC bag, I usually just open the top flap to access the main compartment, but the tri-zip design has turned out to be really useful when I get some groceries for example. Then I can just lay the bag down on its back, open it up completely and fill it up quickly yet carefully without randomly having to throw everything in there through the top opening.\n\nI really like the cavernous pocket in the top flap of this bag where I can keep essential items, like a little knife, multitool, flashlight, lighter, mask, etc. It's very convenient to just put the bag down, open the top flap's zippered pocket and get whatever small item I might need. There are also two small mesh-lined internal pockets on both sides of the bag, near the top. I've been keeping my laptop's charger and cables in one of them. Really nice to have a specific and easily accessible internal pocket for my charger.\n\n**Water-resistance and zippers**\n\nMy UA21 was put through a serious rain test last night when I was outside for over an hour while it poured, and the little top pocket (or lid pocket as Mystery Ranch calls it) stayed completely dry inside.\n\nIt helps that all of the UA21's zippers are coated and very water-resistant. The main compartment's zippers are actually quite stiff so opening it up takes a bit of force. I actually have two minor criticisms and one has to do with the zippers. I don't mind the stiffness of the zippers, because they are chunky and coated, and even add a sense of security, but the zippers tend to get stuck in a few specific spots that have some webbing inside just near the zippers, especially when I unzip the main compartment slowly. The top lid's little pocket opens up really easily and nicely though.\n\n**Laptop sleeve**\n\nThe UA21 also has both a laptop and tablet sleeve. I quite like having two separate sleeves because the smaller one works well for my Kindle or especially my [flat essentials pouch](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/q8n8yn/tom_bihns_double_organizer_pouch_is_my_absolute/). While those sleeves are suspended, promising some protection if I were to accidentally drop the bag, my second small criticism is the lack of bottom padding. There is none, in fact. Maybe I'm just used to having bags that have decent bottom padding, but I definitely had to remind myself to put the bag down carefully today because I had a glass item inside. Also I always carry a chunky power bank which is at the very bottom of the bag and it definitely will take a beating if I throw the bag around.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nWhat I really love about the UA21 is the comfort. The bag's narrow and tall profile seemed a bit unusual to me at first, but since I'm a tall guy, its peculiar shape really fits my body well. The straps and back panel are just super comfortable and the weight distribution is excellent because I keep many items in the small pockets in the top part of the bag. I carried a lot of tech stuff today and the bag felt really light to wear. The UA21 has made me realise that a 6'22'' person like myself really benefits from having an EDC bag that is over 20 inches long.\n\n**Consensus**\n\nOverall I really love this bag, and it's certainly the type of bag that will last a long time. Although I initially purchased the bag for weekend trips, I'm happily using it as an EDC bag now. If you have any questions about it, feel free to ask. I definitely didn't talk about some additional features, like MOLLE webbing on the bottom, and the removable sternum strap, but I reviewed every part of the bag that I've been interacting with a lot.",

I put my hair dryer and portable bidet in the inner ones, water bottle and jacket/umbrella in the outer ones. Tech kit, toiletry kit, packing cube in the main area, and there's enough room to lay a fleece or a pair of flip flops on top. My ONE complaint is that the 24L sits pretty far from the back even with the load lifters pulled as tight as they'll go, so it's not the most comfortable bag when carrying a full load for a long time. I have the 21L in the same color and it's much more comfortable because it doesn't have the laptop area so it sits closer to the back. But for the looks and the amount it can hold in such a compact package and the just-enough organization, it's a winner. This is my go-to non-work (read: don't need a suit) weekend trip bag.",

I received a lot of recommendations, but the one I settled on was peakdesign everyday 30L bag in their new X-Pac material colorway. I got a Techpouch to go with it since I have lots of cables, adapters and small items I need for those devices.\n\nI needed to be able to carry a switch, a steamdeck, headphones, viture XR pro glasses, viture neckband, controllers, headphones, powerbank, power adapters, cables, laptop, mouse, and tablet. That's a lot of stuff and I also wanted it to be easy access so i can pull anything out quickly and put it away quickly without fumbling through layers of a bag. These side doors were perfect on this bag.\n\nI grabbed an extra divider off their site so I can create more layers.\n\n  \nHere are some pics of how I got the inside electronics layered in.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/uRupPut.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/uRupPut.jpeg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/jFgZpBi.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/jFgZpBi.jpeg)\n\nThis is the tech pouch from outside\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CIGhgKL.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/CIGhgKL.jpeg)\n\nThe Coyote Xpac colorway is very dark dijon mustard colored in dim lighting, but when you're outside it turns into a gold color due to the shiny surface. The X-Pac material seems like it will hold up well (I have an X Pac pack from Aer so I knew I already wanted this material type from peakdesign)\n\nThanks again for all your suggestions and also for leading me to a good fit I was looking for",

            "body": "UPDATE 2: Looks like the gmsniper2004 hasn’t made any sales since I brought these fakes to Mystery Ranch and PayPal’s attention. Also all the branded stuff like Carryology patches, Aer/Arcterix/Mystery Ranch/etc bags have been taken down - there is only a generic molle accessory pouch listed on their store currently. \n\nI’m still waiting for PayPal to go through their process before I’m able to get my money back. Pretty disappointing that eBay doesn’t have a better process for protecting buyers from fakes but I think we can still call this a success. In order to receive my refund through eBay’s process, I was required to send the known-fake bag back to the seller. This is something that local police advised was actually illegal to do and would leave me open to investigation and possible a fine/charges if the bag was intercepted in-post. I am hoping providing a stat dec stating that I will destroy the bag will be enough for PayPal to process a refund.\n\nHopefully that is one less fake bag seller out there. Let’s report the fakes, people and protect the community!\n\nUPDATE 1: The seller immediately approved the return but this is the wrong way to go about this as it allows them to continue selling fakes and to use the pack they sold me to scam another person. Also it will allow them to keep their eBay store open so I am perusing another route.\n\nMystery Ranch have confirmed the bag is counterfeit. Unable to pursue further through eBay as the seller has approved the return so my only option is to return the bag or close the case if going through eBay - I have a feeling this has happened before! I have been advised by local police not to return the pack as it is illegal to ship counterfeit goods and I have been told to destroy the pack instead.\n\nI have raised a claim with PayPal with [attached correspondence from Mystery Ranch](https://i.imgur.com/U83SgAo.jpg) and am awaiting a response from the seller before PayPal investigates further. Will update again as necessary.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nPurchased this camo Urban Assault 21 from eBay for 200 USD landed. It arrived today and disappointed doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel. Luckily I have another Urban Assault 21 purchased directly from MR for comparison.\n\nLid and main body seams don’t line up, batch tag is generic with garbage info, shoulder strap logo is backwards and in the wrong position, zipper pulls are wrong length and thickness, camo runs horizontally and not vertically and the hang tags are poor quality with incorrect colours. \n\nLooking at the sellers history it looks like I’m not the only one they have fooled and looking at their current listings I don’t think I’ll be the last. I thought this was a niche enough product that people wouldn’t bother to counterfeit it - lesson learnt!\n\nI’ve submitted a claim to eBay and I’ve reached out to Mystery Ranch for clarification. Will update post as necessary. \n\nBe careful everyone!",

Looked at the specs again and decided not to. 400 bucks for a 22l bag that is almost 4 lbs and xpac makes no sense. 22l is too small for a weekend trip really, which makes this an EDC bag. Why does an EDC bag need to be 4lbs with an overbuilt harness and have a beaver tail? Also, for me, it doesn’t look professional enough to take to work. So, it's an EDC bag I can’t use every day. \n\nThe more I looked at it the more I thought it was overpriced and over-engineered. That said if I had 400 to blow I would have probably bought it and made the call to sell it later. But 400 was just too much to not care about right now.",

I agree that there was a lot of hype and I wasn't 100% happy with the overall process.\n\nThat said, I disagree with not having the time to consider the purchase. They were giving breadcrumbs of details for a few weeks and the full design article was up almost a week before the drop. While there wasn't the option to get reviews ahead of time the fact that this was a v2.0 made it so there were few questions that went unanswered.\n\nI did end up picking up one in olive as it hits so many of the check marks I had been looking for. I don't know that I will be any more or less satisfied with this than any of the other 5 bags I have tried out and ended up returning over the last several months. All of the bags I have tried and returned were industry standards that had been out with several reviews and tons of information available on.\n\nOf course the biggest difference here is that I don't have the option to return the bag if I don't like it. If that happens then I am prepared to take a loss on the secondary market. Hopefully if I make that determination quickly enough there will still be people in markets that didn't have access that will be interested in a fair sale.\n\nI do appreciate all the commentary here though. It allowed me to be more prepared for what to expect and to temper my hopes.\n\nFor me the bottom line is that I am a picky SOB, so I appreciate this type of release as it gives this nexus of options that you wouldn't normally see in a single pack. We'll see if I am still happy in a month though :)",
