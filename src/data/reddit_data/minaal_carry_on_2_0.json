        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/9q5kyt/packing_cubes_for_the_minaal_carryon_20/",
        "selftext": "The optional Minaal packing cubes are quite pricey at $49USD and you definitely don’t need to use them. The Minaal site doesn’t give dimensions on the size of the open clamshell side of the Carry-on 2.0. So what are the dimensions, and what other packing cubes will fit in this pack? This post will delve into some packing cube options for the Minaal 2.0, [visit my site](https://onebagtravels.com/minaal-2-0-review/) for a full review of this pack and a packing demo video.\n\nFirst, the optional Minaal cubes are sold in a set of 3 cubes for $49 with 1 large, and 2 small cubes. They are designed to fit inside the Carry-on 2.0, or the Daily Bag. They are made from silnylon ripstop fabric on the bottom, and a thin mesh on top. The set weighs a total of 5.29 oz.\n\n* Large (x1): 33 x 18 x 10cm (13” x 7.1” x 3.9”)\n* Small (x2): 21 x 15 x 10cm (8.2”x 5.9” 3.9”)\n* Total length of all 3 cubes = 18 + 21 = 39cm (15.4”)\n* Total width = 33cm (large) or 30cm (both smalls side by side)\n\nThe approximate dimensions of the large side of the main compartment (the “scoop”) are 45.7 x 35.6cm (L=18” x W=14”). Here are some pictures with a ruler to show the total dimensions of large side of compartment. The [length](https://i.imgur.com/cf0AGXj.jpg) and the [width](https://i.imgur.com/e8LysGH.jpg):.\n\n**Note**: I removed the rain cover for all of these photos, it creates a weird bulge on the bottom of the pack, and tends to get in the way. It makes your use of space less efficient if using packing cubes. If you are going to use the rain cover, I would probably just stick it inside your bag, or inside a packing cube (in a zip lock if it’s wet).\n\nHere is a reference picture of the bag packed with the [Minaal cube set](https://i.imgur.com/mP29veE.jpg), one Large (33 x 18 x 10 cm) plus two Small (21 x 15 x 10 cm). Total dimension of all 3 cubes is (39 x 33 x 10 cm / 15.4” x 13”). These cubes are actually smaller than the dimensions of the scoop (18” x 14”), but because they are soft, you could overstuff them to take up more space.\n\nI tried out some of my packing cubes to see how they fit in the pack in different configurations:\n\n* Eagle Creek Medium (4 oz) = 36 x 25.5 x 8 cm (14” x 10” x 3”) 4oz\n* Eagle Creek Small (2.5 oz) = 25.5 x 18 x 8 cm (10” x 7” x 3”)\n* Eagle Creek clean dirty cube (6 oz) = 36 x 25.4 x 10 cm (14”x 10” x 4”)\n* Hynes Eagle Large= 46 x 33 x 8.4 cm (18.1” x 13” x 3.3”)\n\nYou can fit [2 Eagle Creek Medium cubes](https://i.imgur.com/pJ3APFK.jpg) (total dimensions 36 x 50.8cm / 14” x 20”) inside the scoop, but they are slightly squished. The second cubes makes the configuration about 2” too tall. Total weight = 8 oz.\n\nThis [next picture](https://i.imgur.com/TXlrT5J.jpg) shows just a medium Eagle Creek cube (36 x 25.5 x 8 cm / 14” x 10” x 3”) with space on the top. And [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/WOCC2h9.jpg) shows one Eagle Creek Medium plus Small (25.5 x 18 x 8 cm / 10” x 7” x 3”). Total dimensions are (43.4 x 36 cm / 17.1” x 14”). They fit in almost perfectly, with a small gap on top.\n\nThe pictured Eagle Creek cubes are also slightly thinner at 8cm (3.2”) than you can get away with. It might be more appropriate to use the Eagle Creek Clean Dirty Cube (M). It is the same width and length of the Original medium cube, but is slightly deeper at 10 cm (4”).\n\nIf you are looking for one big cube, the large size packing cube from Hynes Eagle (46 x 33 x 8.4 cm /18.1” x 13” x 3.3”) actually [fits in the scoop great](https://i.imgur.com/ym1hoie.jpg), but doesn’t allow room for any other cubes. These are super cheap at less than $20, but you can only buy them in a 3 piece set.\n\nWhat cubes do you use for this bag? ",

Defeats the purpose of a rain cover if you have to open your bag in the pouring rain to get to it.\n\nAgreed though – there's nothing special about the Minaal packing cubes.  I've had better results with the Eagle Creek compression cubes.  The medium Specter / Specter Tech compression cube packed to its maximum just about fits sideways into the Minaal Daily, leaving a decent amount of space above it.\n\n\n",

It feels like the weight is distributed better than my last pack (North Face Borealis), and I LOVE that it opens flat. The built in packing cubes are a nice amenity too. \nMy only caution with this pack is the size on a 5'2\" frame.

And I thought so too!  But here I am again with a very quick one.  I need to decide if I'm keeping the ULA Dragonfly 36 or not.

I forgot.  We've seen enough of the water bottle pockets of these bags, though.\n\nSo, let's get into it!\n\n# Aer Travel Pack 3: [https://imgur.com/a/nZjmghj](https://imgur.com/a/nZjmghj)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzswftdcqn3d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ef710528805505b66b5255b61af7a086766e58\n\nThe TP3 did well.  I did have to use the secondary compartment as there is useful space available in there.  I should've rearranged so the Side Hustle is on top or in the admin panel, but this was what I could do quickly.  The main compartment is fairly tall which made it relatively easy to pack shoes in there.  I think the TP3 is an admirable bag and holds up well.  There is still room if I need to fit anything small in the main compartment (like in between the big items).\n\n# Evergoods CTB35: [https://imgur.com/a/DwSQZ3J](https://imgur.com/a/DwSQZ3J)\n\n\n\n[Y'all order your patches from Alpinehound, right?](https://preview.redd.it/goithjlrvn3d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a3b57f7a2a9cf3138694411d6e3bbc12697bfb)\n\nFunny story.  I grabbed my CTB35, packed it with the previous packing list and got the one pair of On Cloudflyer shoes in.  Got it all closed up and wondered if that was really all another 5L should fit.  As I went to see how much space I still had available in the front dump and slash pockets, I couldn't find the dump pocket.  That's when I realized I had grabbed the CPL28!  I was very pleasantly surprised and reminded how spacious the CPL28 is!\n\nAnyways... The CTB35 took some effort to get fully closed up and the laptop compartment was NOT happy.  However, with some optimization, I'm sure I could've made this an easier pack.  I didn't use the front slash, dump, or the yoke pockets so I had a lot of extra ways to optimize the pack and have some extra room.  So, yet another Evergoods bag showing how it exceeds expectations!\n\nNote: I'm really appreciating all the Evergoods bags with their little zipper-pulling-leverage-point-thingies.  Even though it was tough to close, it was made so much more easy by having somewhere to hold.  I am starting to dislike bags that don't give me a leverage point.\n\nAnother note: The cat was all over me today.  I think she might take 2-3L - I don't think she'd fit today!\n\nAnd now, the reason I've gathered you all here today...\n\n# ULA Dragonfly 36: [https://imgur.com/a/HNQPR6O](https://imgur.com/a/HNQPR6O)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khkaebwsvn3d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b11ff848c774b408b44629f5bf26e4a1ec6c6a9\n\nThe Dragonfly *almost* kept up with the other bags.  I think the Ghost Whale pouch with the CPAP hoses probably would've fit inside, but I initially forgot to pack it so I threw it in a side mesh pocket (isn't that what those are for?).  The Slim Pouch with the power adapters wasn't really fitting inside so I put in the front mesh pocket, which was fine (though bulgy).  I didn't hate it but I don't really like using that front mesh pocket.  This is the only bag that really didn't have extra room.\n\nSo... now what?  All the bags fit about the same, we all know they're all great bags, so what do I keep and what do I sell/return??  I think the CTB35 is in the permanent collection (for now).  The TP3 can be sold and the Dragonfly 36 could be sold or returned.  Lemme know your thoughts in the comments!",

The contrast lining is good but it's only in the secret and nested compartments, so the main compartment which sees most of the use is still black inside. Not sure how heavy the old hardware to make the change in weight worth noting. I do appreciate the more subtle logo. Curiously they didn't seem to address any of the critiques/suggestions from the packhacker review of the 1.0: A small clip or tightening mechanism on the side flaps would help it wear closer to your body, the zips look good but are a little small, turning the corner on the zips can be a little difficult. Note that I noticed all these issues when I first got the sling, but after using it a bit I haven't had any issues with how it fits, the zip size, or opening the sling, so maybe once you get the hang of it those \"issues\" go away.",

Those designs will put upwards of 80% of the weight on your hips where the Pakt will put 100% of the weight on your shoulders. Note the packs I mentioned comes in torso sizes and/or an adjustable harnes for a proper fit. Many travel bags with hip belts come in one size. \n\nSmaller and lighter are better if you can live with the compromises of a smaller kit.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/aurzx3/thule_landmark_40l_initial_impressions_and_review/",
        "selftext": "EDIT: Thanks for the questions, everyone. As of today (3/16/19), I'm done with this thread. Hope it was helpful! \n\nHello, fellow one-baggers!  I posted a little over a week ago, asking about this bag.  There are no reviews online yet, but it checked a lot of boxes for me so I went ahead and bought it.  It is available on eBags, who in addition to their recurring sales offer a 25% off coupon for first-time purchases.  I think this extends to the whole order, though I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I are planning a 2-week trip to Europe this summer, and already own a Minaal 2.0 that we've used on various jaunts abroad.  We love it!  Unfortunately, I can't afford $300+ for a second one, so I was looking for something that was similar without breaking the bank.  When all was said and done, I paid around $125 for the Thule.    I'll include the Minaal in a couple pictures for reference and comparisons.\n\n**First my likes** (and be forewarned, there are many!):\n\n* **The security features of the bag.**  The Landmark has a couple minor details that really make this, in my humble opinion, a very secure bag for traveling:\n   * The main compartment has a \"hidden\" zippered pocket at the top, directly underneath the SafeZone (I'll just use the names that Thule has given the bag's features) compartment.  The zipper can easily be hidden, and it is perfect for hiding valuables that you don't need immediate access to - travel documents, passport, extra cash, etc.\n   * Any one of the four compression straps on the outside of the bag can be aligned to pass through the loops attached to the zippers of the main compartment.  These zippers are also lockable.\n   * Finally, the zippers on the SafeZone compartment at the top of the bag have loops that can be threaded through a small plastic piece to deter thieves.  The SafeZone compartment also opens backwards, that is, the hinge is not right next to your back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The SafetyZone zippers affixed by a small plastic bit.  Nice theft deterrent. ](https://i.redd.it/au4dg9vmssi21.jpg)\n\n[Threading exterior compression strap through loops attached to the main zippers, which are also lockable if you buy a lock separately.  ](https://i.redd.it/fqra8hwmssi21.jpg)\n\n[Threaded and clipped.  ](https://i.redd.it/k42wea1nssi21.jpg)\n\n[Kind of hard to see, but this is the internal secret stash pocket.  Top of the interior compartment, just underneath the SafetyZone pocket. ](https://i.redd.it/rrvepqvmssi21.jpg)\n\n* Unlike the clamshell-style Minaal, **the Thule opens like a duffel bag**.\n   * This worried me at first, since duffels with backpack straps typically carry like... Duffels with backpack straps, and not a true backpack.  However, once I loaded it up with approximately a week's worth of clothes and carried it around the house, it felt fine.\n   * Much like a duffel, you can shove your shit in this fairly easily.  I had about four medium packing cubes and my dop kit in the bag and also shoved my Chacos and a jacket in, and felt like I could fit more if necessary.\n   * There are two internal compression straps.  These are useful for locking everything in place, though I will definitely be using my packing cubes in the future.\n   * The four exterior compression straps I mentioned before each attach to the duffel opening.  The female ends of the clips are recessed into the opening panel, offering a clean look.  There are also loops on the sides of the bag you can use to organize the straps.\n* **The straps and hip belt can be stowed**.\n   * I have seen the guys at PackHacker call this the #danglefreelife or something similar, but it was one of the things I was looking for in a bag.  To stow, you simply unclip the shoulder straps, undo the hip belt, and shove into the openings at the top and bottom of the bag.\n   * The straps are pretty well-padded, as is the back of the bag.  I won't know for sure until I get a chance to travel with the bag (next month, likely), but I suspect they will acquit themselves well.  In terms of thickness, the straps feel almost exactly the same as those on the Minaal.\n* **The laptop compartment** is well-padded, and has room for both a tablet and a laptop.\n* **The SafeZone pocket** at the top of the bag has a hard shell, useful for protecting delicate items like your phone, sunglasses, etc.  It also has some webbing for organization, and is fleece-lined.\n* **There are no garish colors**.  I looked at one of the Osprey bags at REI last month, can't recall if it was the Farpoint or a similar model, and the inside of the bag was some neon caca that made me want to throw up.  This bag has a pretty tasteful interior, a light brown with a vague triangular pattern.  I'm a dad, dammit - I don't need no neon.\n* **The water bottle pocket** fit my HydroFlask pretty well, and zips away if you don't need it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My Minaal 2.0 and the Thule side by side.  The Minaal is a bit taller. ](https://i.redd.it/rvmthhr5tsi21.jpg)\n\n[Open and empty.  You can see the internal compression straps.  You'll probably want to use packing cubes with this given the lack of internal organization.  All parts of the interior compartment are easily accessible. ](https://i.redd.it/2aopufs5tsi21.jpg)\n\n[Minaal and Thule side by side opened, so you can appreciate the difference between the two designs.  The sticker on the top of the Thule has not been removed yet.  ](https://i.redd.it/4t885tr5tsi21.jpg)\n\n**On to dislikes!**  I do consider a lot of these minor qualms, and not enough to warrant returning the bag.\n\n* **The laptop compartment zipper is the only zipper on the bag that doesn't have some kind of security device**.  A bit of an oversight, in my opinion.\n* The part of the laptop compartment that I assume is for a tablet has a false bottom; the other section does not.  No biggie; you can probably slip a few pairs of socks or (clean) undies at the bottom to make up for this.  #nopooponthelaptop\n* **The straps are a wee bit problematic**:\n   * Stowing them is a bit of a chore.  You have to really shove them in and I worry that over time, this could cause an issue.  However, the openings have reinforced stitching and after some experimentation I discovered that it works better to stash the hip belt first, followed by the shoulder straps.  In comparison, the Minaal has a fabric panel that zips shut over the straps, is quick and easy to use, and has a much cleaner look.\n   * There is no adjuster near the top of the straps.  This could be an issue with heavier loads.\n   * The clip that attaches the shoulder straps to the bottom is plastic, and doesn't seem to be heavy duty.  If it breaks, your bag is going to be out of commission until you replace it.\n   * I had to adjust the sternum strap (which is removable, but I don't feel like there is any danger of losing it) to the largest option for it to feel comfortable.  For reference, I am a skosh under 5'11\", and have a bit of a barrel chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[All straps stowed. ](https://i.redd.it/sve3bwantsi21.jpg)\n\n[Hip belt stowed, shoulder straps half in and half out. ](https://i.redd.it/b7awmy7ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[One issue - the shoulder strap is secured by one plastic clip.  If it breaks, you are officially F'd in the A.](https://i.redd.it/0be0su8ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[Straps fully deployed!](https://i.redd.it/r5ydwh8ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[Ther sternum strap is adjustable and removable. ](https://i.redd.it/s34520entsi21.jpg)\n\n* **I wish the bottom of the bag were reinforced**.  My daily backpack is some old Timbuk2 thing I inherited from a friend of a friend, and the heavy-duty bottom has saved my stuff on more than one occasion.\n\n**Overall** \\- pretty pleased with the purchase.  This isn't perfect, but is pretty darn close and will work great for me.  I think I got a great bag for not a ton of money, and I look forward to taking it on trips both at home and abroad.  If anyone has any questions, fire away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Here a couple pictures of the bag packed, per request:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bag packed \\(with pillows\\)](https://i.redd.it/o68f2o0n8yi21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Side view of packed bag.

                "body": "I personally love it. It's the perfect size for me. Although I could probably use a smaller bag, the extra room ended up being very valuable. We have some family in Austria and there were a few American products they wanted, so I brought them over in my bag. Also, before we left Europe we went on a chocolate shopping spree and so my bag was crammed full on the way back. The expandable zipper helps a lot with this. But you can also tighten the straps on the side and make it very compact if you want.\n\nThe other nice thing is that the bag opens like a suitcase, so it's very easy to find what you want quickly. It also converts so that you can carry it like a backpack or like a briefcase. The only problem I have with the bag is that the waist strap is insubstantial. It works, but it doesn't have any padding. Although it may be possible to swap in a better waist strap if you want.\n\nThe compartments and pockets are also very well thought out. There is laptop area near your back \\(although I didn't bring one\\). There's small compartment on the top that is very useful for chargers, earbuds and other things that you might want to access quickly. There's the zippered compartment on the exterior that is really useful for passports, train passes, maps and other flat objects. \n\nThere is also a waterbottle holders that pulls out, but it's more suited for small bottles like disposable water bottles. It's a bit too narrow for Nalgene bottle sizes. It works fine for my Vapur bottle, but I typically just clip it on or put it in one of the main compartments. I ended up using the water bottle compartment for holding all of the coins that we accumulated.\n\nNow the only bags I use for any trip length is this one and the Sea to Summit day pack. I even use this bag for work as it looks professional and can cinch down to the size of a briefcase.",

                "body": "I had one and didn't care for it.  My main complaints:\n\n1. It was hard to pack the main area.  Because it's soft sided and the front half is heavy and kind of rigid, the main area walls would always collapse as you were putting stuff in it.  I'd end up just half-filling it, zipping it and the filling it from the top, which would defeat my clothes organization attempts and make it kinda lumpy.  For similar reasons, it was also tough to just get one thing out of the main area and re-close it\n2. It was uncomfortable to wear.  The shoulder straps were thin for a bag that gets heavy, there was no waist strap, and no attempt to make the back breathable.  It constantly felt like it was pulling me backward and chafing on my shoulders.  The shoulder strap was more convenient for putting down/picking up, but even less comfortable.  I would almost always be sore somewhere after wearing it for any length of time\n3. The laptop area felt unsafe for laptops.  When the main area was full, it would make the laptop compartment bulge outward.  I never felt comfortable putting my laptop in there and would end up packing it in the front instead.\n4. Kind of a side issue, but I found the level of marketing email eBags sent after buying it extremely annoying.  Even after I unsubscribed from marketing emails,  I'd get these \"we gave you a new coupon/some points because we haven't heard from you\" and then \"Your points are expiring\" emails that were obviously just end-runs.  I finally started marking them as spam.\n\nOn the good side, it was tough, I got it for ~$65 (although for an ugly brown color) which felt like a good deal, the luggage tag pocket and the top pocket were great ideas, and the well-placed handles made it easy to stuff into and remove from various racks and compartments.  If you're interested, you may also want to look at something like the AmazonBasics Carry-On Travel Bag, which looked like a slightly simpler, cheaper knockoff of this.",

I keep the extra bar of soap in with my clothes, which helps to keep them smelling fresh. The liquid soap I use for washing clothes in the sink. And the shaving soap I used for shaving. \n\nThe shaving soap turned out to be extremely useful. We met up with some family in Austria and I was given a jar of homemade blueberry jam to bring home to family in America. Well the first night it ended up leaking in my bag and got all over my merino wool dress shirt. I was able to use the shaving soap as a spot treatment and completely removed the large stain.\n\nIn the end I could have gotten away with leaving the extra bar and the extra shaving soap at home. Currently I'm considering even replacing the shaving soap with the bar soap. So in the future I'll probably bring a single bar of Bronner's and the small bottle of liquid Bronner's.",

I got it for $214 shipped, which is a nice savings! It showed up in good condition, but I gave it a bath anyway. After a good cleaning and a refreshed DWR coating, I can confirm that I was dumb and wrong, the materials here are very good. It cleaned up and looks brand new. The 420d is plenty durable, and held up to at least a year of good use from its previous owner. \nI picked up the Aer CPP for Black Friday, and this acquisition brings my backpack count to 3, so hopefully I’m done. \nNow to hunt for patches, and other fun ways to personalize my CTB26.

Putting that aside, what are your feelings on the pack itself?\n\nIs it a perfect hybrid of my two favorite Mystery Ranch EDC packs, the Front (blue) and the ASAP (brown), shown above? Futura Harness (ASAP), water bottle pockets, albeit zippered (Front), Stick-It (ASAP), internal zippered wing pockets (Front), hip/stabilizing belt (ASAP), internal laptop compartment/stash pocket (Front)? Or is it a bag which will be OK at everything but great at nothing; an over-engineered pack with good intentions but lacking real-world functionality?\n\nI will say, I am intrigued. In 2019 I walked across Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda carrying my Mystery Ranch 3DAP ([https://www.instagram.com/thewalkafrica/](https://www.instagram.com/thewalkafrica/)) and am a HUGE fan of the Futura Harness even on smaller EDC bags. I live in Kenya ([www.bomanoma.com](https://www.bomanoma.com/)) and need a pack which can be streamlined enough to not catch on a loose nail in a decrepit public transport vehicle, while also comfortable on a 10 mile hike home after that same vehicle (somewhat expectedly) breaks down. A pack so durable that it can survive a fall off of a motorcycle, but so elegant that it looks good while doing so. A pack robust enough that it can carry my laptop and outdoor equipment through an equatorial rainstorm, but also utilitarian as to hold my daughter's dirty diapers without  stinking up that laptop and gear inside the pack.\n\nI love the layout of the Front but wish it had a Futura yoke and stabilizing belt. I love the comfort of the ASAP but wish it had a few pockets on the inside to keep my small items. The Unicorn 2.0 seems to be the right size, right material, right harness, and seems to have the right features/organization. Based on the pack itself, the Unicorn 2.0 *could* satisfy all of my EDC pack desires, or it could be a total (and expensive) bust.\n\n**Based on the merits of the pack and not the ideology of the collaborating companies behind it, what do you all think of the upcoming Unicorn 2.0?** I have a little less than 48 hours to decide if I want to pick one up, and I have to admit I am genuinely torn!",

I am most concerned with a material's ability to take an absolute beating...because it will.\n\nSince the Unicorn 2.0 would be used in place of my ASAP, that is what I keep comparing it too. According the MR's website, the ASAP is made from \"500D CORDURA® with Teflon® and PU coatings.\" Do you prefer the 500D Cordura over the X-Pac? According to the site I posted, the Unicorn 2.0's X-Pac is \"...Cordura nylon on steroids. Cordura fabric on the front face side with a waterproof lamination on the back side to give it waterproof properties and then the X-PLY reinforcement for extreme strength.\"",
