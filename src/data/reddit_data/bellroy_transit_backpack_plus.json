            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

V2 might be delivering on those—not convinced by the straps, still—but V2 feels like a step back on all other aspects.\n\nThe Pro 22L version doesn’t make a lot of sense to me: they could have just made a better workpack.",

One of the reviews highlighted the \"smaller-than-advertised\" sizing for the Pro 22L [here](https://youtu.be/1BRNjNCMij8?si=PNBb5nuFdBnWUjNF).\n\nAlso wanted to know how your v1 is holding up so far? Do you enjoy using the v1 for EDC?",

Initial impressions where great, I loves the xpac and the front organisation pocket. But after a couple of weeks the honeymoon period ended and I was left with a bag that was just to restrictive for my needs. Alas it was time for another bag.\n\nRoll on to alapaka, there bags where sleek looking and there advertising drew me in, 2 weeks later I had the elements backpack pro and the shift back V3 (not sure what I was thinking there..). Again the initial impressions where good. The quality was top notch and the bags where both great. The pro had good organisation and a good space to pack out but now I found it was a little too big.... This is starting to sound like a Goldie locks problem. \n\nSo ever the explorer I decided to try my luck with another bag... This time I fell into the claws of tomtoc ( I forget the exact model).\nThis was a suprisingly good bag with more pockets and organisation than I needed. But,   it was to boxy. Good god I'm fussy! It also just didn't have the top tier finish I had come to enjoy from the other brands. \n\nBellroy to the rescue? I had the sling mini and I had used and loved that weekly for the last year. Surely they could be the perfect bag provider! Transit workpack first edition orderd and on its way (didn't want the V2 as it lost lots of organisation!). It arrived and my gosh the materials and quality of the bag was lovely, everything just felt so soft and premium. However and this is a big however, those straps. My god they are probably hands down the worst shoulder straps I have ever experienced! They cut into with only the smallest amount of weight in the bag! Oh well. Time to find my perfect bag.\n\n\nI say this with every my whole chest, Able carry is a god tier bag. The materials are amazing, the comfort is unrivaled, the organisation is perfect for my needs and gosh do I love xpac. This bag looks amazing, feels amazing on my back and ticks all the boxes. Will this mean I don't buy another bag in 2025? Who knows. I do however know that I will be putting this bag through the ringers and enjoying every moment with it!\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for reading that brain dump.

        "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI’ve been looking for an upgrade to my every day carry bag and I’ve landed on the Bellroy transit work pack option. \n\nI’m a bit torn between the blue version and the black version though. I work in the city and I’d probably be using this mostly in the city and casually. \n\nI know the black is more versatile but I quite like the blue as it’s less similar to the Targus black bags companies usually hand out. Problem is quite a few of my coats are a similar shade of blue to the bag and I wear navy chinos sometimes as well. \n\nJust wanted to get peoples thoughts, is black the obvious choice here or is the navy colour just as good/better?",

An admin panel with many pockets, a spacious main compartment with another pocket, and a sunglasses pocket. You can make a luggage pass through sleeve with its external lash points with a sling.

These ones I like around 24 to 28 L, my typical everyday carry is 20 L (Fjallraven Raven). But the thing that’s going to vary the most is the comfortability of it because some people say that the straps are too thin.\n\nFjallraven Skule and Patagonia Refugio: \n• are more hiking/outdoorsy type backpacks, with the elastic cords and the material. The Refugio has a separate laptop zipper at least but idk about Skule laptop, edit the Skule has the laptop sleeve in the main compartment. Also the Refugio 30L is too much for an everyday backpack. \n\nThe Victorinox may be the best if you want 32L for an everyday and travel companion because it has the luggage pass through and is the most subtle of them. \n\nLulumelon: I do not know about that bag.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ovvj1x/bellroy_classic_backpack_plus_v2_vs_v1_all/",
        "selftext": "Having owned Bellroy Classic Backpack Plus (black) for a couple of years and mostly using the backpack as my daily office bag (spare the pandemic time of course), could not resist getting a v2 version of it in a \"ranger green\". Here is an outline of all changes that I was able to spot.\n\n# Exterior / overall construction\n\n* The v2 pack is spec'ed to be 50gr lighter than v1.\n* The v2 pack is spec'ed at 24l vs 22l for v1. I can't tell if there is really a difference in volume.\n* My particular \"ranger green\" color fabric feels just a bit more \"plasticky\" than the one on the black one, but I like it overall. The color is actually slightly darker than on the photos.\n\n[v1 on the left, v2 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/khboyg1osre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8db946d2abed322b1aa86eebcfeb2aa73e63b08d)\n\n* The bottom lost a hard line around it, became smoother with the front. Still does not stand, but better looking IMHO.\n\n[Bottom does not have a hard line around it](https://preview.redd.it/zdpm00opsre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16be063d5cd1e3d2658b8a5e499f1bd2fc7f9699)\n\n* All zip pullers are bigger and more rigid.\n* Back padding became more rigid and has a divider split for ventilation. Can't really say if lumbar support became anymore comfortable since I did not notice any effect from it it on the v1 either.\n\n[Back padding](https://preview.redd.it/3pa2ltuvsre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=896078e7ac6fbe7a1a5a5069b0fec70d23f64a27)\n\n* Slightly different construction of sternum strap attachment points.\n* Added subtle Bellroy logo on the left shoulder strap.\n* Straps have thicker and more rigid padding.\n* All horizontal zippers changed direction. They are opening right to left in v1 and left to right in v2.\n\n# Interior / pockets\n\n* Front pocket space expanded to the right of the zipper, creating a bit of extra space. Keychain ring lash became longer too.\n\n[More space in the front pocket](https://preview.redd.it/0ixmclvqtre71.jpg?width=1535&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec4163a3ddaf5841430550dfa21acd6d49d0418e)\n\n* Sunglasses pocket zipper got a long zipper puller,  it is much easier to open it than in v1 (unless you added an extended pull to v1's zipper yourself of course).\n* The same sunglasses pocket got a soft lining, instead of just a thin stretchy mesh in v1.\n\n[Sunglasses pocket with a soft lining and a longer zipper puller](https://preview.redd.it/4si7qpyytre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9a2e3d18fef14f92e84a11705fab0b46c2e7546)\n\n* Interior lost water bottle pocket (was not usable anyways IMHO) and got papers (business papers, man) compartment. The papers compartment is rigid, not stretchy.\n\n[Swap of a water bottle pocket with papers section](https://preview.redd.it/72vnk3jeure71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e999639ea2c2361fe65b04ffcf88b2ce89d7fba)\n\n* Interior pocket became smaller in length but wider at the top, all its surface is fronted by the mesh/stretchy material (in v1 there was a part of the pocket going below the mesh/stretchy area). It also got hi-viz internal lining.\n* In the v1 there is an issue, when you open up a main compartment, due to the way front panel folded it created a \"fold\"/\"bottleneck\" between upper part of the compartment and a bottom one, this reduced visibility and access into the bottom part of the main section.  Due to new bottom/front panel construction it is mostly gone now.\n\n[Harder line in the middle of v1 created main compartment visibility issues](https://preview.redd.it/itgz8q9ktre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b345305444f0e26d26c28411ab02ab28216c6ebe)\n\n* The laptop compartment itself did not change, but its accessory pocket did. No more meshed zipped pocket, a rigid \"flap panel\" pocket instead of it. Because the pocket is so high to the zipper of the laptop compartment itself I think it is as secure as the zipped one, but now access to it is much faster as you don't have to unzip yet another pocket.\n\n[Zip pocket on v1 vs flap panel pocket on v2](https://preview.redd.it/rlyle021vre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232f1aeb3222f41b21d2d290b6df54f471e815b9)\n\n* This pocket also has hi-viz internal lining.\n\n[Hi-viz internal lining helps finding things faster](https://preview.redd.it/2wxop5f2vre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c5e2307ba2002124b42b611e7358beb7278f65)\n\nAll in all I loved pretty much every change to the bag, which fixed some of my griefs with v1 and improved some of the others I was not aware needed an improvement :) It is really a well thought through evolution of v1, not a revolution. Will be keeping it as my daily bag.\n\nIf you have any specific questions - let me know, happy to answer them.\n\nIf you would like to buy my v1 for 50% of what they ask on [bellroy.com](https://bellroy.com) for it - feel free to DM me.",

Also, I took off the leather brand label in the middle: it's easy to unpick the stitches, and it gives the bag a cleaner look.

They’ve been moving away from leather for a while and I don’t like their new stuff. I have the A5 leather notebook and I love that thing so much, it looks and feels great. But if you compare that with their new offering of the Tokyo Folio, which just looks clunky and cheap and poorly made. It’s not sexy, sleek, or stylish. And the prices have stayed the same or gone up for lesser quality. Also a side note, their emails used to be gorgeous. I have reached out several times to them just to applaud their designer. But now they are stale, cookie cutter email templates. Just seems like they got too big and are cutting corners to maximize profits. Sorry for the long read.",

Could be used in a professional environment as well as a carry along/personal carry.\nCapacity seems fine, since there are not a lot of pockets....you can just throw stuff around, Accessible with clam(half)opening.\nThe front easy access pocket has a dimension of its own..can store a lot.\nMain pocket feels great and premium. Will not recommend for any wet/liquid stuff and has enough organization.\n\nCons.\nLack of Organization in the front pocket, though the top pocket meant for glasses can be used for smaller items, earphones/gum/change.\n\nComfort - the strap and back pannel, are soft, cushiony and high qulaity.\nWith heavier loads it will not be super comfortable, No sternum strap.\n\nAdditinal thoughts:\nThe bag is not dedicated to any particular use case, there are better workbags, better carry ons, better bags for city walks, better edc or weekend bags.\nThe classic is versatlile enough for all of those...jack of all...a Classic Backpack in all sense.\n\nVerdict : go for it, if you are looking for something simple and premium. Won't regret it.",
