            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility.

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous.

        "selftext": "I’m not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren’t *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I’m hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend’s Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI’m now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I’ve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC’s current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L…which led me to the realization that there aren’t any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I’m thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I’m SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip “D-shaped” clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it’s big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack’s front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating – I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else 😉\n\nObviously, I haven’t traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone’s on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I’m not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there’s anything I haven’t mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I’m not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren’t *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I’m hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend’s Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI’m now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I’ve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC’s current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L…which led me to the realization that there aren’t any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I’m thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I’m SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip “D-shaped” clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it’s big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack’s front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating – I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else 😉\n\nObviously, I haven’t traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone’s on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I’m not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there’s anything I haven’t mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I’m not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren’t *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I’m hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend’s Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI’m now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I’ve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC’s current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L…which led me to the realization that there aren’t any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I’m thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I’m SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip “D-shaped” clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it’s big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack’s front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating – I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else 😉\n\nObviously, I haven’t traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone’s on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I’m not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there’s anything I haven’t mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I’m not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren’t *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I’m hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend’s Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI’m now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I’ve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC’s current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L…which led me to the realization that there aren’t any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I’m thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I’m SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip “D-shaped” clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it’s big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack’s front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating – I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else 😉\n\nObviously, I haven’t traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone’s on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I’m not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there’s anything I haven’t mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

I packed it up like I would on a flight with a Hydroflask, an Eagle Creek quarter packing cube with a light merino layer, and my EDC Tom Bihn Side Effect. My sunnies case and a coin purse with advil/nail clippers/etc... went in the inside pocket and keys clipped to the leash. It folds down into quarters slightly smaller than the 1/4 packing cube and much thinner. It can also roll up into a large fist sized roll but I think that would take up unnecessary space in my main bag (either a Kanken, a Tom Bihn Paragon or S25 depending on the trip).\n\nThe whole tote is really light, not much more than the packable grocery bags I use. I'll likely fold it into quarters and slide it in the top of my main pack, with the Side Effect worn cross body. Before boarding I'll slide out the tote, throw in the Side Effect and pop all my in flight bits in. There is still room for a bigger sweater or snacks and the book I inevitably acquire while waiting to board. The straps are a good length to wear over a jacket and not too slippery. I prefer a tote to be wider than tall and this is visually a good size on me but might look a little small if you're a big guy (I'm a US size 16, 5ft 10\" tall woman). I do wish there was a clip or something to hold it rolled up but other than that it's great.",

It can also roll up into a large fist sized roll but I think that would take up unnecessary space in my main bag (either a Kanken, a Tom Bihn Paragon or S25 depending on the trip).\n\nThe whole tote is really light, not much more than the packable grocery bags I use. I'll likely fold it into quarters and slide it in the top of my main pack, with the Side Effect worn cross body. Before boarding I'll slide out the tote, throw in the Side Effect and pop all my in flight bits in. There is still room for a bigger sweater or snacks and the book I inevitably acquire while waiting to board. The straps are a good length to wear over a jacket and not too slippery. I prefer a tote to be wider than tall and this is visually a good size on me but might look a little small if you're a big guy (I'm a US size 16, 5ft 10\" tall woman). I do wish there was a clip or something to hold it rolled up but other than that it's great.",

I've affectionately started calling her Bag Lady because she brings her work laptop bag, a duffel bag with clothes, a tote bag with her phone/waterbottle/book, her personal laptop bag for her fiction writing, and a tiny telfar purse for going out. Thats like 5 bags to pack just for Friday night to Monday morning every week and she has to walk up a long hill to get to my apartment from the car.\n\nHer duffel bag is old and falling apart so it would be nice to get her something stylish and practical to bring for the weekend that she could also repurpose for travel in the future if we move in together. \n\n**My budget is ~ $200-$250** \n\nHere's a few I've been looking at but I'm open to suggestions:\n\n1. [LO &amp; SONS Catalina Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/products/catalina-deluxe-organic-canvas-dove-grey)\n -its big and budget friendly but not very stylish\n\n2. [Nomad Lane Bento Bag](https://nomadlane.com/products/the-bento-bag)\n -very practical but it might be too professional for our usual Netflix&amp;chill type weekend in bed + over budget\n\n3. [AWAY Large Everywhere Bag](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/large-everywhere-bag?color=coast_nylon)\n- bonus points for a fun color,  leather straps and free customization but also the heaviest = least practical \n\n4. [Stella Mccartney for Adidas Nylon Travel Bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/luggage-and-travel/stella-mccartney-for-adidas-nylon-duffle-bag-hu6b7)\n-she showed me this one many months ago I think  just because she liked the blueish green color but it's sold and I have PTSD from buying her pre-owned gifts from therealreal before that arrived in poor condition :/\n\nThanks!",

I'd been curious about Greenroom for ages but never actually bit as most of their other bags have designs that just didn't quite click for me. \n\nThere have been a few other similar bags from other makers over the last few years, like the Rickshaw Banzai and Tom Bihn's Maker bag. But I think that the gussetted opening on the Quickdraw is a really good design feature if you regularly need to get into the bag while you're wearing it. \n\nHopefully Greenroom will continue to iterate on the design. I know that the comments on the wander review said that the contrasting lining is planned for the next production run.",

I had the aer dopp kit 2, and was just ginormous and kinda harder to clean given is more fabric like outer material.\n\nfrom what i can tell, the GEplus is pretty large, while the aer is on the more compact side.\n\none thing i noted with the explorer slim i tried is that the pockets are rather tight and limiting. despite being slightly larger, might be an issue for the plus as well. and it does have a ton of pocketing, which i frankly didnt care for. hence,[the good ol' two pocket mini was good enough for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/10ejj6e/smaller_sized_dopp_kit_comparison_gravel_explorer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).",

The green and gray small pouch is by the Doughbut brand—bought that one on JetPens—and it contains work items like my badge and work keys. I carry everything in my backpack into my clinic and office areas, then if I’m lucky with a lunch break, I take the sling with me to grab coffee or go on a quick walk. That allows me to carry my badge, keys, AirPods, phone, and sometimes a book with me without the “bigness” of the backpack for what’s usually a pretty quick jaunt outside. On the weekends, that little green pouch gets tucked away, and I use the backpack for daily carry. I have been LOVING this setup so far!!!",

            "body": "I was actually facing a similar decision not long ago (Bellroy Classic Backpack Plus vs. Aer Tech Pack) and I eventually decided to go with the Bellroy. So far (2 weeks in), I do love the bag, although there are a few things I wish could be improved.\n\nPros:\n\n* Design: The Bellroy is absolutely stunning; I love the unique shape and minimalism, and it definitely wouldn't look out of place with a suit or in an office environment. In fact, the 2 exterior quick-access pockets blend in with the design and the zippers are hidden, so you can't even tell that these pockets exist (good for theft-proofing).\n* High quality, water-resistant materials: the venture-weave polyester feels really nice to the touch, and I've walked through heavy rain with the interior remaining completely dry.\n* Thoughtful organization; I find the Aer to have way too many organizational slots that take up unnecessary space, while Bellroy has the perfect amount of pockets and organization. 2 exterior pockets (one for phone/wallet, another for keys/earbuds/accessories), a pocket in the main compartment for a notebook/small book, and my favourite: a pocket on the top of the laptop compartment that stores a charger/mouse/other accessories and that doesn't intrude into the main compartment (seriously, why don't more bag manufacturers do this?)\n* Holds its shape: the Bellroy holds its shape when it's empty (it doesn't slouch), and it never looks bulky even when stuffed to the brim. It can even comfortably stand up on its own if it's more than 80% filled.\n* Comfort: the straps and the back panel are very nicely padded, and the lumbar support (basically a bulge near the lower spine area) actually helps a lot with comfort when walking with the bag over extended distances.\n\nCons:\n\n* Weight: this is by far the biggest problem for me. The Bellroy is pretty heavy even when completely empty, although the comfort does somewhat make up for it.\n* Lack of exterior water bottle pocket; I do understand why Bellroy decided not to include it (it interferes with the minimalist design), but I'm constantly paranoid that my water bottle would leak so I'm hesitant to keep it in the interior water bottle pocket.\n* Lack of pen slot/document sleeve: it's not a problem for me (I carry around a pen case and notebook all the time), but it's something to note if you're expecting one.\n* Size: It's slightly too big for my daily EDC needs (a laptop, notebook, book, pens, water bottle, and various small tech accessories) although the extra space does come in handy when I occasionally need to bring a change of clothes for workouts.\n\nIf I were to choose now, I would probably go with the normal Bellroy Classic, which has most of the features and organization of the Plus but a slightly smaller size; the Brown Buffalo Conceal is another good option to consider. I don't like the Aer mainly because of how the outside material doesn't keep its shape if you're stuffing it (the glossy finish makes it even more obvious if there are objects protruding against it), but that's just my opinion and I've seen many others enjoy the bag. Overall, if you really want simple but effective organization, a sleek aesthetic, and you're OK with extra weight and size, then I would 100% recommend the Bellroy Classic Plus.",

Really nice bag. \n\nTotally different from the CPP. Both 24L yet the bellroy is much slimmer and seems to hold less. Better for EDC. CPP has been nice for an overnight/minimal weekend tripper. \n\nAlso dig the bellroy look, less utilitarian than AER.",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: pulled the trigger on the Aer Gym Duffel 3 with the Travel Kit toiletry bag. \n\nMy only concern is the small 24L but watching the very few youtube reviews out there, it seems it might work for what i need it for. \n\nWill update on the quality of the bag when i receive it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nello!\n\nNeed your help on choosing the perfect weekend getaway duffel to pair with my new Aer Daypack 2 backpack. (which I absolutely LOVE). My tech and gear will stay in the Daypack. Shoes + clothes + CPAP machine will live in the duffel. I've narrowed down my choices to the following 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; trying to match with my Aer Daypack 2 which is why I'm trying to stick to Aer products, but it's not an absolute must. Shoe compartments are a plus, laptop compartments a plus. Would love it if anyone has real-world experiences with either bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) [Aer Gym Duffel 3](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-3-black) **$169** \\---- 24.1L (17\" x 11.5\" x 9\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9l2y1vj6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc79be145ebf631f8a1bb2acca6801bca4e1076d\n\nThis one seems like the newest out of the families of Aer duffels, but also the smallest coming in at 24L. The shoe compartment is a big seller for me since I love that feature and prevents me from buying a shoe bag. I also like to keep my dirty clothes in there after the trip.\n\n* *Pros*: Matches with backpack, newer materials and improvements from the Duffel 2 (i think?), shoe compartment, brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons: S*maller than the others, more expensive. only one review on youtube from RushFaster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) [Aer Gym Duffel 2](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-2-black) **$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhlbprkk6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4f99188cdcb3986828a7d4f180d9c5356b2122\n\n**$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nI believe this is the version before the Gym Duffel 3, but some reason the size is way bigger.\n\n* *Pros:* shoe compartment, larger in size,brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons:* older? maybe doesnt have some improvements in materials like the newer Duffel 3? Also another con is the zipper down the center, seems awkward. couldnt find any reviews online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.)  [Aer Travel Duffel](https://www.aersf.com/travel-duffel-black) **$170** \\---- **35L** (21.3\" x 12.6\" x 9.1\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewyvwm7l6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e05290a837652c94f80846ff83269b68f0a6406\n\nThis is the one specifically for traveling with a huge bucket-style opening to dump clothes in. Although this one is considered the \"travel\" one, it don't like that it doesn't have the shoe compartment at least.\n\n* Pros: big bucket-style opening, nice handle, compression straps, brand uniformity with aer\n* Cons: no shoe compartment, the center-placed handle doesn't seem like it might handle a lot of weight if carried briefcase-style. few reviews online but everyone says it's decent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[removed peak design 35L since feedback has been so-so\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love and appreciate your input!",

Your post does both and more, so thank you!\n\nPersonally, I'd go with the one that looks best with your Daypack and for me, that's the [Aer Travel Duffel](https://www.aersf.com/travel-duffel-black) \\- hands down.\n\nThe Gym Duffels look (as intended) like gym duffels. For travel, I think you want a more put-together look.\n\nRegarding the built-in shoe compartment: having a separate bag for your shoes is functionally the same (keeps the dirt off your clothes), looks cleaner (fewer external zippers), and is more versatile because you can leave it at home if you don't need an extra pair of shoes for your trip.\n\nThere are tons of high-quality, lightweight options for shoe bags too. I have one of these [Killspencer shoe bags, made of parachute material](https://killspencer.com/collections/bags/products/parachute-bag-2-0-shoe-bag?variant=18745161318462).\n\nAs for the Peak bag, I'm just not into the design, but if you're open to other brands, I love  /u/duncanjewett's suggestion for the [Bellroy Weekender](https://bellroy.com/products/weekender/baida_nylon/marine_blue#slide-0). I'm a huge fan of internal water bottle pockets, which that bag has, and the construction and features are all on point. It also comes in a larger size, called the [Weekender Plus](https://bellroy.com/products/weekender-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-0).\n\nLet us know what you decide!",

There is no dedicated shoe compartment because PD makes a Shoe Pouch, is my guess. \n\nIf I had any criticism of it, it would be the carry handles. The magnets are a novel concept, but IRL they aren't strong enough to hold the handles together except under ideal circumstances. As a result, you've now got two magnetic strips as handles - they're narrow and not at all comfortable to carry through an airport or something. I eventually took mine off, and only use the shoulder strap (which is awesome) or the grab handles on the ends to carry it vertically. I guess you could also get something to wrap the carry handles (like a [Mr. Gripper](https://defybags.com/collections/accessories-1/products/mr-gripper-horween-cavalier-whiskey-leather), for example) and that would also solve that issue.\n\nEverything else I've enjoyed, these are good bags for the money. You can sometimes find refurbished travel duffels on the PD eBay store - they come with the same warranty as the new bags, and you can save some money.",

They’ve been moving away from leather for a while and I don’t like their new stuff. I have the A5 leather notebook and I love that thing so much, it looks and feels great. But if you compare that with their new offering of the Tokyo Folio, which just looks clunky and cheap and poorly made. It’s not sexy, sleek, or stylish. And the prices have stayed the same or gone up for lesser quality. Also a side note, their emails used to be gorgeous. I have reached out several times to them just to applaud their designer. But now they are stale, cookie cutter email templates. Just seems like they got too big and are cutting corners to maximize profits. Sorry for the long read.",
