            "body": "Was umming and ahhhing about this backpack but pulled the trigger, even though I was hesitant to spend that kind of money on a bag I hadn't seen in person.  Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

I guess you could count the additional interior straps as a travel feature. But the bag only has a 6.1 inch depth, so is that really needed?\n\nDimensions measure 22 inches x 15.75 inches x 6.1, so it can't take advantage of the typical carry on sizes (22 in x 14 in x 9 in) offered by major airlines and it's too big for a personal item. Also the hidden water bottle eats into the main compartment? Worst of all the bag retains the thin shoulder straps with no added hip belt. As a traveler you'd want a quality carry system.\n\nAll for a total of $329, with no lifetime guarantee? Though, I'll admit it's a nice looking bag like all other Bellroy bags.",

Having it in hand, I can see it’s no worse than all the other backpacks I’ve had in the past.  I also can understand the hate for it - being way overpriced for its size. But nothing wrong on this end, very usable day to day, durable and proved great for a weekend getaway. Some features may seem gimmicky but usable. I’ve used the zipper water bottle pocket - it’s great. Tote, used it, works, is actually a decent shape and clips on the front of bag, so don’t need to awkwardly hold in on shoulder with the pack. Yes RFID is pointless. ",

Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

        "selftext": "Handbag homies! \n\nPlease help me buy my gf a nice weekender bag.\n\nContext:My gf(27) lives 45 minutes away in LA traffic and she makes the trip every Friday night to stay with me in my humble studio apartment for the weekend. I've affectionately started calling her Bag Lady because she brings her work laptop bag, a duffel bag with clothes, a tote bag with her phone/waterbottle/book, her personal laptop bag for her fiction writing, and a tiny telfar purse for going out. Thats like 5 bags to pack just for Friday night to Monday morning every week and she has to walk up a long hill to get to my apartment from the car.\n\nHer duffel bag is old and falling apart so it would be nice to get her something stylish and practical to bring for the weekend that she could also repurpose for travel in the future if we move in together. \n\n**My budget is ~ $200-$250** \n\nHere's a few I've been looking at but I'm open to suggestions:\n\n1. [LO &amp; SONS Catalina Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/products/catalina-deluxe-organic-canvas-dove-grey)\n -its big and budget friendly but not very stylish\n\n2. [Nomad Lane Bento Bag](https://nomadlane.com/products/the-bento-bag)\n -very practical but it might be too professional for our usual Netflix&amp;chill type weekend in bed + over budget\n\n3. [AWAY Large Everywhere Bag](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/large-everywhere-bag?color=coast_nylon)\n- bonus points for a fun color,  leather straps and free customization but also the heaviest = least practical \n\n4. [Stella Mccartney for Adidas Nylon Travel Bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/luggage-and-travel/stella-mccartney-for-adidas-nylon-duffle-bag-hu6b7)\n-she showed me this one many months ago I think  just because she liked the blueish green color but it's sold and I have PTSD from buying her pre-owned gifts from therealreal before that arrived in poor condition :/\n\nThanks!",

Mainly why you choose it over any other backpack, roller for travel, ect. \n\nI’m a healthcare worker that flys once a week and I’m usually carrying a bunch of medical supplies and expensive medications. I see patients some times in rural areas. These are day trips on short flights. \n\nI’m thinking in my head of having a duffel as a carryon but I really dislike the backpack straps that I’ve seen on a lot of the modern duffels like the Patagonia Black Hole. I won’t be doing any long distant walks by any means with the bag at all. A robust kind of roller seems ok also but the wheels might get slightly beat up. \n\nThanks in advance. \n\n(Pictures: Wanded Carryall Duffel)",

        "selftext": "\n\nRecently purchased two Gorucks during the holiday sale. Snagged the m23 at the $100 price point. First impressions, the material looks incredible. best looking fabric I’ve experienced so far. The bags are lightweight for their size, and they both are very similar in silhouette. The GR1 is the better one bag for packing cubes. My ideal use case for the GR1 would be paired with a sling. I need some sort of extra organization for travel documents, first aid, etc, that the GR1 lacks. The zips are hard to pull across the edges due to the rain-flaps, which i find quite annoying. The M23 is not ideal for one bag but you could make it work, you can fit a peak design cube if you dont plan on putting any bulky items in the water bottle pockets. The organization and exterior pockets are quite nice. The only thing it lacks is a top QAP. Im a fan of zip water bottle pockets for EDC, especially the ones that disappear into the main compartment, the original bellroy transit workpack pockets were too small, and the pro version protrudes out and looks ugly. It fits a 24 oz owala. I think aesthetically and functionally, i gravitate towards the M23 despite the top loader. The bullet double compartment or a GR2 26L would solve my organization issues with the GR1. I think at the end of the day, I will end up returning the GR1 because zipping around the corners is quite difficult.",

        "selftext": "**\\*\\*\\*NOT LOOKING FOR PACK RECOMMENDATIONS – ALREADY BOUGHT ONE, JUST A FYI POST!!!\\*\\*\\***\n\nI spent probably 20+ hours reading/researching over the last month looking for my dream onebag. Went through the offerings of 35 major brands which were mentioned a lot. I thought my informally-compiled list might help some other people if they were **specifically looking for a \\~25L CLAMSHELL bag that is also LIGHT.** From traveling to 26 countries before I knew it HAD to have these features (for me, your list may vary of course!):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* HAS to have FULL **Clamshell** opening – I'm NOT ripping everything out to get to the bottom!\n* HAS to have 2x/each side external **Compression Straps** (for when overpacking AND have bag be non-floppy when packing less i.e. for day use)\n* HAS to be under \\~**55x35x20cm** (21.65 x 13.78 x 7.87\") international carry-on size (mostly [based on this list of 64 airlines](https://upgradedpoints.com/travel/airlines/carry-on-luggage-size-chart/))\n* MAX **30L** (prefer 24-26 main compartment, don't care about external pocket volume)\n* HAS to be around **30oz or below** (HARDEST goal to hit!!!, my current &amp; ancient 30L is 39oz fyi)\n* HAS to be **under \\~$300**\n* HAS to have **Backpack Straps**\n\nAgain, your exact needs can vary greatly from mine... but I come from the ultralight backpacking crowd where a massive very durable **60L pack** with proper frame and suspension and all those bells and whistles can weigh a mere **17 ounces**... and was blown away by the heavy goliaths that keep on being mentioned as the GOAT Onebag (like GoRuck GR2 26L at **56oz**, or Aer TP3 35L at **66oz** – nearly \\~FOUR TIMES as heavy as my backpacking pack, \\~half the size, and taking up almost a THIRD of your carry-on weight limit!!! - absolutely insane in my eyes). And yes, I totally get that the Onebag WILL weigh more than my backpacking bag since it has all the zippers and padding and such my backpacking bag doesn't have a need for (even with it being \\~twice the capacity...).\n\nAnyway, here's my ROUGH list, full of facts but also my own personal notes and sentiments so in no way scientific (and some bags I just didn't like something else random on so discounted)... just thought it still might help some people looking for similar lighter pack as I was. I ended up ordering an ULA Dragonfly, in Ultra fabric, customized with: non-stretchy front pocket (those ALWAYS snag and get jacked-up at some point), extra set of lower compression straps, and 2\" longer shoulder straps.\n\n1. **Able Carry, Daybreaker 2**, 25L, 23.3oz, $128, 19.7\" x 10.2\" x 7.5\" – J-Zipper… NO side compr. (compression)…. almost like though because at least cheap and light…\n2. Aer, City Pack Pro X-Pac 24L, 40oz, $235, 18x12x7.5”, NO compr. – the famous TP3 is NOT an option, it's 66oz!!!\n3. Arc'teryx, nothing\n4. Bellroy, Transit 28L, 38.8oz... $250, 20.87x14.17x7.48\" – No compr. does seem nice though\n5. Boundary Supply, Errant Pro bag 30L 4.65 lbs!!!\n6. Cotopaxi, Allpa 28L - no side compression.\n7. Cilo Gear, NOTHING\n8. Eagle Creek, NOTHING\n9. Evergoods, , Civic Panel Loader 24L, 44.8oz!!\n10. Exped, NOTHING (Glissade 25 skiing pack is closest at 44oz…)\n11. Fjallraven, NOTHING\n12. GoRuck, NOTHING - stupidly heavy\n13. Gossamer Gear, NOTHING\n14. Granite Gear, NOTHING\n15. Gregory, NOTHING\n16. Heimplanet, Transit Line Daypack 24L, 35oz, $237, no side compr.\n17. Hyperlite Mountain Gear - NOTHING (only small one is 17L)\n18.

MEC, NOTHING\n22. Minaal, NOTHING (50oz 35L, or too small 21L)\n23. Mountain Laurel Designs, NOTHING\n24. Mystery Ranch, website down, but think NOTHING from viewing 10x times before and hate tri-zipper shenanigans \n25. **Osprey Porter 30L -CURRENTLY OWN-, 39oz, 20 x 13 x 8\"** = 34L and meets ALL my requirements besides weight – other model: Daylight Expandable 26+6... but no compr.\n26. Outdoor Vitals, Kota UL, 45oz...\n27. Patagonia, Black Hole Mini MLC 30L - NO side compr.\n28. REI, NOTHING (Trail 25L doesn’t open up all the way…)\n29.

I mean if I was bring critical this reads a bit like a shill post:\n\n* You want under 30oz. Dragonfly is 29.something\n* You say you want max 30L - the Dragonfly is advertised around that\n* You say you PREFER the main compartment to be 24-26L. Odd since most people's complaints about the Dragonfly are regarding the discrepancy between the main compartment and the total advertised size. \n* You say you want EXACTLY 2 side compression straps. Why not 4? \n\nThat said, your thought process is very similar to mine. I've used many bags on my one-bag journey. I started with the RedOxx airboss, moved through some hybrid bags like Patagonia MLC... and ultimately landed on the Goruck GR1 and GR2. For 11 years of extensive (250,000 miles / year) international travel I found that I generally was happy with the 26L GR1 and didn't need more space. \n\nA personal trip to Europe last summer (which would include some anal cheap airlines) changed my mind on that and I looked for a lighter weight alternative. I stumbled upon the 29OZ ULA dragonfly in the X51 and bought it on a whim. Gotta say, I LOVE the bag:\n\n* Has a nearly identical pocket layout as the GR1 26L (except it has side water bottle pockets)\n* Is super light\n* Feels reasonably sturdy\n\nOverall a great bag and MY current go-to.",

Plus I've streamlined my packing list since 2015 and haven't been filling out the 30L Porter, so wanted just a bit smaller. The Porter also pretty much ONLY has the main pocket (yeah, technically has a thin vertical slash, and a top one I fit my 3-1-1 TSA baggie in), but I always try to NEVER use anything but the main compartment on any pack, especially stretchy ones which I hate (that's always the first thing to go on MANY packs I've had... which is why my custom Dragonfly is getting the front stretchy sleeve replaced with regular Ultra fabric).",

Also no side compression straps on that pack (which is a dealbreaker for me... if I pack too much there's no way to compress the pack to fit through the -possible- sizer at the airport... and if I don't pack much at all I always dislike how the bag will flop around all day when I can't compress it with side straps).",

ULA is, after all, an UL backpack manufacturer.\n\nWhat you're talking about -- with the specific feature set and specific exclusions -- make you a \"niche buyer within an already niche market\". \n\nSo you have a chicken-and-the-egg problem: \n\n* _Is_ there a market for your dream bag?\n\n* If yes, at what price point could it be fabricated?\n\nIt seems like the sort of project you might contact someone at r/myog about and see if you could commission something.\n\nBut since the Dragonfly is already on the market -- is there room in the market for a _second_ bag like that? I don't know yet.\n\n. . . . . . \n\nJust for the humor of it, my bag is an GR2-34L. Never let me down, and I'm okay with the weight penalty so I don't need to treat it like my UL gear.

I'm crossing my fingers I can actually fit all my crap in it lol - [this video has me hopeful - about 25L in the main compartment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0td6gCS6YE), not \\~21 like ULA says (currently using an Osprey Porter 30 which I don't fill up all the way, thus looking for a smaller and slightly lighter bag).",
