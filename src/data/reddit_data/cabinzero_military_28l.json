I was inspired by another backpack mod post and wanted to share what I did to make my Cabin Zero Military 28L backpack more usable.\n\nThe backpack has an extremely small water bottle holder on one side and a handle on the other. Since my 24oz water bottle wouldn't fit into the little holder, I used Velcro strips on the handle side to make a webbing and attached a MOLLE water bottle carrier to hold it in place. I also used the top compression strap to keep the top of the bottle in place and now have a usable water bottle holder!\n\nWithout the water bottle in it, I can fold it down and still use the handle as normal. Anyone else do small kids to their packs to make them more usable?",

The main compartment only has 3 pockets, two are the zip pockets and one is the back pocket. The second of the zip pocket doesn't go the full length of the bag, but rather only the length of the front compartment. \n\nI would prefer more internal organization, for wallet, passports etc. The mesh pocket is pretty good quality. \n\nDidn't feel like tech bag: I prefer a divider between my tablet and laptop. The back compartment is just, well, one big pocket. Also links back to compartments. \n\nSummary: Maybe I'm being too picky with a low budget, but I would not settle for the bag because I think cons were unfortunately more like  dealbreakers for me. I am heading to Japan and I heard they have AER bags, so I might take a look and choose to invest if I really like it.",

Especially the inner mesh. \n- I love the simple exterior\n- Great for packing cubes\n- Looks like it definitely fits under-seat. \n- Shoulder straps seems comfortable\n- Would make a good weekend / EDC bag for some\n- Okoban tag\nCons (elaborated below):\n- I don't have packing cubes, prefer more internal organization\n- Didn't feel like a tech bag\n- I'm used to having two side pockets. (Only has one bottle holder, forgot picture)\n- No sternum straps (not really dealbreaker)\n\nDespite the pros and cons, I am returning it. I would use it for a little while more but my shop return policies are quite strict, so I decided to return it after a day. Would my review change if I used it longer? Probably, but it felt like I had to adjust my packing style. \n\nElaboration:\n\nI like the green and exterior design, with the cons out of the way I would really love this bag a lot. \n\nCompartments : I mentioned that I think it's good for people who use packing cubes because I didn't feel like there was enough internal organization also because my bags always had more compartments / pockets. The main compartment only has 3 pockets, two are the zip pockets and one is the back pocket. The second of the zip pocket doesn't go the full length of the bag, but rather only the length of the front compartment. \n\nI would prefer more internal organization, for wallet, passports etc. The mesh pocket is pretty good quality. \n\nDidn't feel like tech bag: I prefer a divider between my tablet and laptop. The back compartment is just, well, one big pocket. Also links back to compartments. \n\nSummary: Maybe I'm being too picky with a low budget, but I would not settle for the bag because I think cons were unfortunately more like  dealbreakers for me. I am heading to Japan and I heard they have AER bags, so I might take a look and choose to invest if I really like it.",

            "body": "Took a 2-hr flight on SPIRIT airlines (first time -- not bad. interesting people lol) for a 4-day trip (Thurs-Sun) to Nashville, TN. \n\nI was able to fit:\n\n1. Medium sized packing cube with: 4 boxer briefs, 4 socks, 3 tees, 2 linen button down shirts, 2 pair of chino shorts\n2. Patagonia Black Hole Cube (dopp kit)\n3. Small mesh bag for chargers + cables\n4. 1 bucket hat\n5. Teva sandals\n6. Ipad mini 6\"\n7. Kindle paperwhite\n8. water bottle (exterior pocket)\n\nIt fit -- but luckily it was a summer trip and things were light/thin. I do tend to overpack so I think I definitely could've gotten away with a bit less and not make the bag so tight. \n\nOverall, I found that the bag lacked structure on the back panel so I felt like it everything was pushing fairly hard into my ipad + kindle in the back laptop portion. If I had my 16\" backbook pro, i wouldve felt a little uncomfortable about the amount of pressure pushing into the laptop itself... \n\nOverall, i think it's a great back for a short weekend trip (Fri-Sun) type trip. I usually travel with a carry on + personal item so I bought this as a personal item to my luggage companion, but this spirit airline trip was a super budget trip going from JFK to Nashville for $100, no carry-on. \n\nAs you can see in the picture it fit fairly well under the seat -- a small part of the bag creeped over my toes but it wasnt uncomfortable. I didnt find it difficult to pull things in or out of the bag either. The zipper pulls you see on the top part of the bag is easy to access during the flight which i was able to pull out a snackbar during the flight. water bottle once out, was very difficult to put back because of how packed the bag was. \n\nOverall im fairly pleased with this bag. I bought it on ebay for $45 so can't really complain for that price either. Again -- as a solo, onebag for a trip, it was tight, but as a personal item along with a carry-on, i think its perfect. I also take more weekend trips to get out of NYC for quick friday morning - Sunday morning trips and i think its perfect for those little trips.",

            "body": "Took a 2-hr flight on SPIRIT airlines (first time -- not bad. interesting people lol) for a 4-day trip (Thurs-Sun) to Nashville, TN. \n\nI was able to fit:\n\n1. Medium sized packing cube with: 4 boxer briefs, 4 socks, 3 tees, 2 linen button down shirts, 2 pair of chino shorts\n2. Patagonia Black Hole Cube (dopp kit)\n3. Small mesh bag for chargers + cables\n4. 1 bucket hat\n5. Teva sandals\n6. Ipad mini 6\"\n7. Kindle paperwhite\n8. water bottle (exterior pocket)\n\nIt fit -- but luckily it was a summer trip and things were light/thin. I do tend to overpack so I think I definitely could've gotten away with a bit less and not make the bag so tight. \n\nOverall, I found that the bag lacked structure on the back panel so I felt like it everything was pushing fairly hard into my ipad + kindle in the back laptop portion. If I had my 16\" backbook pro, i wouldve felt a little uncomfortable about the amount of pressure pushing into the laptop itself... \n\nOverall, i think it's a great back for a short weekend trip (Fri-Sun) type trip. I usually travel with a carry on + personal item so I bought this as a personal item to my luggage companion, but this spirit airline trip was a super budget trip going from JFK to Nashville for $100, no carry-on. \n\nAs you can see in the picture it fit fairly well under the seat -- a small part of the bag creeped over my toes but it wasnt uncomfortable. I didnt find it difficult to pull things in or out of the bag either. The zipper pulls you see on the top part of the bag is easy to access during the flight which i was able to pull out a snackbar during the flight. water bottle once out, was very difficult to put back because of how packed the bag was. \n\nOverall im fairly pleased with this bag. I bought it on ebay for $45 so can't really complain for that price either. Again -- as a solo, onebag for a trip, it was tight, but as a personal item along with a carry-on, i think its perfect. I also take more weekend trips to get out of NYC for quick friday morning - Sunday morning trips and i think its perfect for those little trips.",

I basically have sets of essentials I throw in my bag and go, and I thought this would be a perfect time to share what they were \n\n1. Clothes — change of clothes, including fresh pants because I knew it would be hot and I’d get sweaty at the party. I also packed a short-sleeve layering piece and pajamas, although I didn’t really need the pajamas. I only brought one pair of shoes, which were a pair of platform otbt sandals that do well in brushy backyards and are comfortable. \n2. Toiletries—I have a set of travel supplies that always stay in my quart bag. First there is a tin of solid shampoo, conditioner, and a cleansing bar. Cerave hydrating cream is my one big liquid. My dental set (travel paste, floss, tongue scraper) with my electric toothbrush (it’s a hassle to travel with, I put the cap on the brush and detach it from the body). A kit with my zoryve medicine, hair ties, and tweezers. A wooden comb that fits well in my bag. Silicone face scrubber. A lush trial pot I put my hair cream in, and a travel deodorant stick that I reuse by melting down my favorite antiperspirant and pouring it in. Travel razor. Before trips, I’ll top off my small cases with my actives and sunscreen, but this time I didn’t take a contact lens case of my azelaic acid and retinol or my lush trial pot of sunscreen since it was one night and I could use my sister’s face sunscreen. The things I have to grab from my daily collection are: my astepro allergy spray, blush, eyeliner, and one vial of my thyroid meds. \n3. Travel bidet. Every single time. \n\nI also clipped a hat to my backpack and wore it at the party, and I brought my 24 oz hydroflask (fits in the old military bag side pocket—I’m glad they updated that for the new bag!). \nI always keep a dedicated travel usb-c and lightning charging cord in my bag, although my mom has cords in her guest rooms.

        "selftext": "[36L CabinZero bag packed](https://i.imgur.com/v8w7o4P.jpg)\n\nI bought this bag in the Black Friday sale for £45 (RRP £60) and been itching to test it out. I was ermming and ahhing between the 28L and 36L bag as the former is advertised to be RyanAir compliant and I was wanting to use this bag for mostly short trips to Europe for the underseat/hand luggage only tickets. I decided to opt for the 36L bag because:\n\na) The dimensions of the bag was closer to 28L, though CZ insists that dimensions doesn't determine the capacity. \nb) I have flown with RyanAir several times before and have seen people take way bigger bags and reckoned this would pass. \n\nFirst of all, I LOVE the colour of this bag. The lavender colour really stood out in the sea of black bags, and I loved the contrast with the blue buckles. It will go with my summer and winter outfits. I like that there are compression straps as well. It's clamshell but not all the way, but this didn't bother me at all. \n\nI'm 5ft 3 and this didn't seem too enormous on me. It's basically a big fabric box on your back. There's minimal organisation, one small inside zip pocket and a larger outer zip pocket. There's a laptop sleeve as well but honestly it's so flimsy I would use a separate laptop case if I were to bring my laptop. \n\nThe climate was forecasted to be around 10-14 C during the day, mostly and drop more in the evening. Layers were important.\n\nOn my person: Jumper, trainers, jeans, top, bra, reversible jacket (the teddy lining side I would use when it's colder), beanie, scarf. My outfit [here](https://i.imgur.com/PnIY5mS.jpg).\n\n**What I packed:**\n\n* 4x knickers\n* 4x socks\n* Joggers\n* Sweatshirt\n* 4x tshirts/tops\n* Toiletries + makeup\n* Charger + adapter\n* Mirrorless camera + extra lens\n* Book\n* Journal + pen\n* Sunglasses\n* [Lefrik small backpack](https://i.imgur.com/iNwQhRm.jpg) (used as a day pack)\n* 750 ml water bottler\n* Flip flops\n\nI used two packing cubes, a med/large one for clothes and toiletries and a small one for undergarments. I fit the small one in the bigger one. The above brought my bag to 6kg (the bag itself is 800g I believe) and I definitely had room for more, but this amount filled it out quite nicely. I'm glad I did opt for the 36L because there is no way I would have fitted everything in the 28L and I felt I was quite minimalistic. \n\n[Picture of contents](https://i.imgur.com/yML2B3W.jpg)\n\n**Reflections**\n\nI felt that I packed the right amount of items. I didn't really use my mirrorless camera (this usually happens) so maybe I'll leave it home for future trips. \n\n[The bag did fit underneath the RyanAir seat.](https://i.imgur.com/k2hXH4Z.jpg)\n\nI DID experience achy shoulders if I wore the bag for more than 20 minutes. This wasn't too much of an issue as I was not on my feet for too long as I was either on transport or dropped off my luggage at the airbnb and used my day pack when out and about. \n\nOverall I liked this bag, especially the style. For the price I thought it was decently made and suited its purpose of getting my stuff from A to B. \n\nI will be going to Seville in March so will try it out again then, when the weather will be much warmer than this trip!",
