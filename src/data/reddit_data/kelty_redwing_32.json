It was advertised at 40 liters but the capacity is comically smaller than that, especially when compared to my husband’s old Kelty redwing which is also supposed to be 40 liters. \n\nI splurged on an Away travel backpack a few years ago and I adore the bag, but just noticed it’s advertised at 25.5 L. It can hold a good bit but it doesn’t feel like a 25L bag to me. Then I picked up a Vera Bradley pack (which I did not expect to be my unicorn bag but here we are) and it’s stated at 24L but it holds so much. It’s larger in 2 out of 3 dimensions than the away bag. \n\nObviously some bags make more efficient use of space than others, but is it common for capacity assessment to be just flat out incorrect?",

But until consumers stop buying bags which _don't_ spec the standard, market forces will prevail.\n\nIt's good to know about ASTM F2153-07, but I find thinking of \"bag class\", then use actual measurements and other research to be more predictive of bag performance.",

Getting the family ready for a one bag trip and I’ve noticed that some bags seem drastically different than their advertised size. \n\nI ordered a cheap Amazon backpack for my man-sized teenager and am returning it for quality issues (it had good reviews). It was advertised at 40 liters but the capacity is comically smaller than that, especially when compared to my husband’s old Kelty redwing which is also supposed to be 40 liters. \n\nI splurged on an Away travel backpack a few years ago and I adore the bag, but just noticed it’s advertised at 25.5 L. It can hold a good bit but it doesn’t feel like a 25L bag to me. Then I picked up a Vera Bradley pack (which I did not expect to be my unicorn bag but here we are) and it’s stated at 24L but it holds so much. It’s larger in 2 out of 3 dimensions than the away bag. \n\nObviously some bags make more efficient use of space than others, but is it common for capacity assessment to be just flat out incorrect?",

A \"35L class bag\" may be anywhere from like 28L-39L(ish).\n\nIt's why getting good reviews, with pictures, especially within a sizer, is useful.\n\n. . . . . . . . .  \n\n#**Q: Is there a standardized measurement system for the volume of bags?**\n\nA: Yes, there is the standard measurement system of [ASTM F2153-07](https://www.astm.org/f2153-07r18.html). But until consumers stop buying bags which _don't_ spec the standard, market forces will prevail.\n\nIt's good to know about ASTM F2153-07, but I find thinking of \"bag class\", then use actual measurements and other research to be more predictive of bag performance.",

You don’t need an E tool, you don’t need rain gear AND a poncho, you can eat food cold or you can make a fire, a stove and fuel is wasted space. Also you’ll need more than a woobie, they’re not warm and aren’t as compact as options like the jungle bag or blanket from snugpack. \n\nUnless you’re planning on using this as a sustainment plan for the military then you’re basically packing a refugee bag and should pack accordingly. Essential documents, small irreplaceable light items, something to keep you dry, something to keep you warm, some food, some water, a way to clean water, basic hygiene, change of clothes, a knife, a phone charger and battery pack, a light, a lighter, warm layers, first aid kit and a sleep kit if you have space. \n\nShort term sustainment means you plan on getting to a shelter, so plan for getting there, living there on the floor of a school gym with no bed, and have whatever documents you need to continue your life when it’s over.",

I’m not familiar with the Ready-wise packaging, but mountain house or stripped MRE’s don’t take much space. Back in the olden days, I could put a pancho liner, pancho, space blanket, + wet weather top in 3L Alice butt pack. \n\nThis has nothing to do with “fitting” but I’d swap the camelback + aquatabs with a micro filter and some Smart water bottles (depending on the availability of water, etc.\n\nIn 40L, I carry a 3P tent, Rain top and bottom, bag for electronics (battery bank, charging cables, headlamps, etc.), 3 days rations including coffee and oatmeal for breakfast, something like tortillas and pb for lunch, several protein/candy bars for eating on move, and a Mountain House for dinner in a food bag with a bear hanging kit, 20° sleeping bags, blow up sleep mat, groundsheet for the tent, intermediate fleece liner, separate thermals for sleeping, multiple pairs of socks, crocks/sandals for camp shoes, cook kit, primary and alternate water filters x3 1.5 liter smart water bottles, GPS, map and compass, first aid kit, and toiletry kit - if I’m not forgetting anything.\n\nI am not a gambling man, but would put money on being able to pack the listed items in 30L assuming we aren’t talking about a 5 gallon pail for the food.\n\nETA: blow up pillow with down pillow cover and a puffy jacket.",

The length is a real deal killer as it won’t allow the bin to close. Read the carry on maximum dimensions for any airline you will be using. A typical US carrier sets the limit at 22'' x 14'' x 9''. Bargain carriers may be smaller. Maximum weights vary as well. \n\nAirlines want nice little boxes to sit in a row in the bin. Most hiking packs are too tall and too deep front to back.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/4zrhjo/help_me_find_my_perfect_edccommuteday_bag/",
        "selftext": "Wall of text incoming but I'm currently on the quest to find, in my opinion mind you, three perfect backpacks for varying levels of stuff I do. I've already acquired my long trip bag, a medium trip/hunting/camping bag I cannot for the life of me find the perfect EDC/Commuter bag for me. I'm looking for a bag to be able to use for a multitude of singe day outings and I'm very picky on what I would like for it, but more on that later.\n\nCurrently in the day bag rotation I play with a [Go Ruck SK26](http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Goruck-Slick-SK26-Rucksack.jpg) a [Kelty Redwing 32](https://www.backcountryedge.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/k/e/kelty-redwing-32.jpg) and a [Tezing 1260](http://www.tenzingoutdoors.com/tenzing-packs/the-choice-packs/tc-1260-the-choice-day-pack.html). \n\nThe GoRuck is okay I guess. I got the SK series on a blowout sale and it's been a very well built bag but it lacks the features of a GR1. Even then it's a little big and doesn't have the features I really want in a bag.\n\nThe Kelty is straight awesome. My idea of a perfect bag. The only minor complaint I even can think of is the lack of organization in the main pouch. I already have it as a mix between the long trip and a medium hunting/hiking bag and it fits that role perfectly. I've used in in two GoRucks now and it's been a champion. However, I just think it's too large for a day bag so looking for something smaller. If only they had like a 26 liter one or something this mystery would be solved...\n\nThe Tezing is my main hunting/shooting bag which is configured pretty differently then what I want for a day bag. It's a pain to switch gear in an out on a constant basis and rather leave it just as a hunting/shooting bag. That and the camo on it is kind of a turn off for putzing around town with.\n\nSo now the demands in what I want for the bag. Maybe it describes yours and you can lead me towards the path of salvation? Who knows! Here's what I'm mainly looking for;\n\n1) Be able to hold what I want for a EDC/Day bag and not be overpacked/stuffed/bulky. I carry quite a bit and usually for more than one person (fun being the packmule...) Somethings I'm gunna have in this bag will be extra socks, small REI raincoat, a gun magazine or two(?), portable chargers, cables, Ipad with keyboard (or) a 17.5 in Laptop, snacks, at least 1L Naglene, 2-3 pens, a note book and some small little pockets and doodads for gizmos and gadgets. Looking for around 20-27 liters for a ballpark size.\n\n2)Have at least ONE exterior pocket for a water bottle. That is the biggest downfall of my SK26 and why it isn't in the lead for Bag of the Month. That and lack of a lot of internal organizing... \n\n3)Have an outer mesh pocket and or a way to set up a bungee cord/shock cord holder for wet clothing or extra jacket. Seems like a weird request but it's what I want...\n\n4)Look cool, but not tacticool. A lot of issues I have being prior military, current LEO and living near an army base is the cringe factor of tacticool bags everywhere. I'm not a fan, flat out. I like high speed/low drag gear with some tactical features but molle just turns me off to a bag if it isn't designed to be used in a tactical sense. Call me silly but that's what being in America is about. I'm cool with velcro places to show off my GoRuck Swag or my state flags and whatnot.\n\n5)Be affordable. A big one I know since bags get pricey. I'm fine with spending upwards to $200.00 on what could be my new perfect bag but I'm not looking for a Mystery Ranch or anything.\n\nNow that I've listed some of my bigger demands, I've already done some research on some bags in hopes someone on Reddit knows more about them or owns one and can vouch and/or someone can lead me down a new path of bag. \n\nHere are my contenders thus far;\n\n1) [Vertx Commuter](http://vertx.com/edc-commuter-bag#) is a sling bag that seems loaded with good features at a decent price. I even like the idea of a sling bag for a day bag to be honest. The gripes are that it doesn't have outer pocket for water and it has almost TOO many features that seem to lean towards being a stealth operator... Sort of a turn off and it seems to ruin the capacity of the bag. \n\n2)[Alpha One Niner - Evade](http://www.alphaoneniner.com/shop/recon-9-evade-backpack) started off being my primary choice but I haven't found much about the bag itself. That and the website doesn't explain too much about the bag and it's very hard telling what you'll be actually ordering. Small gripes but if I'm paying that much for a bag I wanna know what it looks like. I'm not a fan of the camo options but they seem to lean heavily towards those models. They can also get very pricey it seems...\n\n3)[Direct Action Dust](https://us.directactiongear.com/packs-and-bags/backpacks/dust-backpack#44) is an awesome looking bag. I saw /u/bbp84 show his off on /r/EDC. [This was the post](https://imgur.com/a/2Hixk). The only turn off from this bag is that it maybe to tacticool for me. I do like the laser cut pals system which makes it blend in a bit more, but the available colors are geared towards military (although the PLWoodland and Artic bags look pretty awesome)...\n\nSo my plight is two fold for you fellow backpack aficionados. Are the above mentioned bags worth their salt? Anyone owners of these bags that will vouch? If not what would you recommend?\n\nTL;DR - need new bag listed a couple options and open to some suggestions.  ",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone. I am looking for a new backpack for travelling around. I will mostly be walking about in urban areas or doing light hiking.\n\nI am currently using a backpack that looks like this:\nhttp://image.rakuten.co.jp/wip03/cabinet/item01/sl/b0/slb042205106_5.jpg\n\nIt has a smaller front main compartment and the full sized rear main compartment, both of which are zippered. Lets consider both to be main compartments since I need to open their zips to get to anything inside. Inside both of them are several subcompartments and pockets. However, only one of the internal pockets in each main compartment is zippered.\n\nEverytime I use the bag, I find myself using the internal zippered pockets to keep my passport, torchlight, spare batteries, spare phone, first aid kit, camera, keys... etc. Basically everything other than food, water and clothes. I find it reassuring that anything kept in those zippered internal there won't fall out if I have to open the backpack in some kind of awkward position or place. However it can get pretty crowded, and sometimes its hard to close the internal pocket. My other complaint about my current backpack is that it can get quite tiring for my shoulders if I carry a heavy load all day, even though its capacity is only 25L to 30L.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately, my current backpack has started breaking down after many years of use, so I am looking for a new backpack.\n\nAs per the title, I am looking for something with just 2 or 3 main compartments, preferably zippered although drawstring or roll-top is fine too. And then I want plenty of zippered internal pockets or zippered internal compartments. Basically, if I want to access something from these internal pockets, I will need to go through two layers of zippers.\n\nOther nice things to have:\n\n* 30L (or 25L to 35L) capacity. \n\n* Hip belt, preferably one that can be tucked away. \n\n* If there is a water bottle holder, I prefer one that doesnt use an elastic band to hold the bottle in place, cause it gets loose after a while.\n\nThanks in advance for your time and your help.\n",

The best thing to do is to go to a shop and try a bunch of different backpacks. Put some weight in it and some stuffing plastic. Walk a few circles in the store to test out the comfort of each bag. All backs are different and not every bag fits every back. That said im not really fond of the north face bags. The brand is an outdoor brand but if youre looking for bags then its better to look for backpack brands like Osprey, Deuter or Lowe Alpine. They are much more focused on comfort. The best bag for you is the one that fits the best.",

One trip was in Iceland and it held up better than I expected with the rain. Of course I had a cover for heavy rain. A negative was the waist buckle broke on mine twice. One of the times was 6miles into a 20 mile trip on the Florida trail, that wasn’t ideal. I replaced it with a buckle from Amazon and worked great ever since. You might considering investing in a buckle to keep on hand if this is product issue but could just be me.",

It’s winter in Australia, which is on the temperate side (average day temp is about 16C / 61F, with night temps dropping to 0C / 32F). It’s a little more than what I usually travel with internationally, but I’m travelling by car. I still like to pack light anyway. I know I can trim bits and pieces, but also, it’s only 5.5kg (12ish lbs).\n\nComplete holiday time, no work whatsoever (phew).\n\nMainly staying in cottage / cabin style AirBNB accomodation, usually 4+/- 1 nights at a time.\n\nI’m not the weigh each item type (one day, perhaps), I just weigh the whole bag at the end. So, weight listed includes the bag, but obviously not items worn or are on self. I tend to think of my packing list as more on the moderate budget side of things - the clothes I wear daily in non travelling life anyway.\n\nThis trip is all relax time. Lots and lots of reading. Some moderate hiking. A bit of strolling. Some meals out, but nowhere too fancy. Not sure if I’ll get the chance to swim, but the option’s there for thermal pools I suppose.\n\nOnce international travel opens up again in a safe manner, I intend to make trips to North America, Japan, and Europe with essentially the same packing list (less some frivolous stuff and airline unfriendly gear).\n\nAs always, happy to answer questions. Just bear in mind time difference, please.\n\n## BAG\n\n* Dakine Wondersport 18L.\n* I really do love this bag and size.
