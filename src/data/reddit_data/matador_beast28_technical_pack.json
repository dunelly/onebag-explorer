I‚Äôve included my packing list below and some photos :) I really love this community and how much inspiration it has given when planning/packing for this tripüíõ Also, we are a queer/lesbian couple so if you have any advice for country recommendations or safety precautions I‚Äôm all ears! \n\nBAG:\n\nMatador Beast 28 L\n\nCLOTHING:\n\nBlack Tank Top x2\n\nBlack Tube Top x 1\n\nBlack Long Sleeve Shrug x 1 (yoga material) \n\nBlack Zip Up Vest x 1\n\nCream One Shoulder Top x 1\n\nBlack Outdoor Voices RekTrek Zip Pants x 1\n\nBlack Athletic Shorts x 1 \n\nWhite Linen Button Down x 1\n\nGrey Hanes Tank for Sleeping x 1 \n\nBoxers for Sleeping x 1\n\nLeggings x 1 (donate after colder months) \n\nSweatshirt x (donate after colder months)\n\nRain Jacket x 1\n\nUNDERGARMENTS:\n\nUnderwear x 7\n\nWorkout socks x2\n\nWool socks x 1 (possibly donate after cold)\n\nSwimsuit x 1\n\nTOILETRIES:\n \nToothbrush x 1\n\nTravel toothpaste x1 \n\nShampoo x 1\n\nConditioner x 1\n\nDr. Bronners Soap for Body x 1\n\nDr. Bronners Soap to Wash Clothes x 1\n\nHair Brush x 1\n\nDeodorant x 1\n\nHair Gel x 1\n\nMakeup Kit x 1\n\nHair Clips x 2\n\nRazor w/ 3 Replacement Blades x1\n\nMakeup Remover Pad x 1\n\nTretinion x 4\n\nBody Lotion x 1\n\nSunscreen x 2\n\nFace Lotion x 1\n\nTweezers x 1\n\nPaula‚Äôs Choice Liquid Exfoliant x 1\n\nSHOES:\n\nKeen Women‚Äôs Zerraport II\n\nFIRST AID KIT:\n\nBand Aids x 10\n\nPepto Bismol x 1 bottle\n\nMagnesium x 1 bottle\n\nIbuprofen x 1 bottle\n\nLotrimin x 1 tube\n\nCortizone Cream x 1 tube \n\nIBS pills x 1 bottle\n\nWellness Formula x 1 bottle\n\nBaggu Bag (crossbody):\nVelcro Wallet x 1\n\nBaggu Grocery Bag x 1\n\nTravel Deo x 1\n\nHand Sanitizer x 1\n\nTravel Sunscreen x 1 \n\nVaseline x 2\n\nGum x 2\n\nTECH: \n\nAirTag x 2\n\nKindle x 1\n\niPhone 12 Max Plus x 1\n\nHeadphones x 1\n\nConverter x 1\n\nFan/flashlight/portable charger x 1\n\nMISC:\n\nBaggu Foldable Hat x 1\n\nBucket Hat x 1\n\nSunglasses x 1\n\nSleep Mask x 1\n\nNeck Pillow x 1\n\nKleenex x 3\n\nMaster Lock x 2\n\nUnigear Rain Fly x 1\n\nNotebook x 2\n\nFoldable Water Bottle x 1\n\nMasks x 3\n\nPen x 1\n\nFrogg Togg Sport Rag x 1\n\nStasher bags x 2\n\nBeach Towel x 1\n\nShower Towel x 1\n\nOsprey Daypack x 1\n\nSecret Fanny Pack x 1\n\nBandana x 1\n\nDelicates Bag for Dirty Clothes x 1 \n\nProtein Bars x 10\n\nLiquid IV x 10\n\nNOT PICTURED: \n\nMatador Foldable Mini Blanket x1\n\nMatador 2L Dry Bag x 1\n\nBody Sunscreen 3.3oz x1\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention\nI wanted to say how amazing having a Charles Schwab bank account has been.

Would highly recommend getting all three before traveling or even the more *elite* versions if you can afford it. My partner and I each have these so if anything ever goes wrong we have a Mastercard, visa, and separate bank accounts!",

The side pocket in the Aer is more useful to me since it's still pretty discrete while still being pretty accessible.\n* It doesn't stand on its own very well; it tends to lean forward even when loaded with a laptop in the back\n* There's a tiny stain on one of the mesh pocket in the main compartment\n\nOverall, I am liking this bag.

        "selftext": "Recently got the GlobeRider 35 to replace my Aer Travel Pack 3 Small X-pac. I won't be posting a lot of photos since you can see them on their official website, but I will try to post some initial impressions on the bag and compare it to the Aer.\n\nPro\n\n* Bigger AND lighter than the smaller Aer Travel Pack 3 Small X-pac\n* With my typical load it's very comfortable. Not sure if it's the hip belt or simply because it's lighter, maybe both\n* I like the internal organization on the main compartment more than on the Aer\n* I like that the laptop compartment is inside the main compartment and not in its own compartment like the Aer. I think this maximizes carry volume better.\n* There's an opening below the laptop sleeve that you can reach inside to take out the back padding to perhaps make it even lighter.\n* It has an external water bottle pocket\n* Both the shoulder straps and the hip belt can be stowed, and the hip belt can be removed entirely\n* Most external pockets and compartments have their own volume that expands outward somewhat\n\nNeutral\n\n* The shoulder strap is maybe a little wide for my body type, and the padding is very hard and stiff. Maybe a little bit of break-in will help\n* I wish the admin panel is better. Aer has a better and more useable admin panel in my opinion\n* I haven't used a hip belt since maybe 20 years ago and I am not sure I would use it with this bag or not. I've carried a \\~40L Eagle Creek duffle/backpack for travel for many years and that one doesn't have hip belt nor a very good harness system, and it was \"fine.\"\n* The hip belt is quite difficult to remove because of the velcro\n* I wish they kept the grid fabric design from the 45L version, even if not in UHMWPE\n* The front mesh pocket is quite floppy and loose. Maybe I will add some cords to tie it down to keep things from moving or falling out\n\nCon\n\n* Some questionable stitching on the shoulder strap attachment points\n* Fabric isn't as nice as Ultra or X-pac\n* The secret pocket is quite difficult to use, but I guess that's the point. You would probably only put things in there that you won't need very often. The side pocket in the Aer is more useful to me since it's still pretty discrete while still being pretty accessible.\n* It doesn't stand on its own very well; it tends to lean forward even when loaded with a laptop in the back\n* There's a tiny stain on one of the mesh pocket in the main compartment\n\nOverall, I am liking this bag. I just wish the fabric is a little \"fancier\" and the black version isn't so \"understated.\"",

I had a [great onebag trip to Europe last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/x58kx9/europe_2_weeks_september_my_onebag_is_too_big/) but found myself thinking that my backpack was still too heavy and bulky, so this time I want to optimize for weight and size.\n\nSo, here is a first pass of packing my [Matador Freefly16 Packable Backpack](https://matadorup.com/products/freefly16-2) for 2 weeks in Tokyo and Kyoto!

This definitely allows me to  be able to pack less clothes.\n* During  my last trip to Japan during this same time of the year, the weather  was hot and rainy.

I have an Osprey Farpoint 55 (great bag, HUGE), an Osprey Transporter 30L (good bag, but heavy and big), and a Matador SEG30 (this was my first choice, but after packing it had a ton of empty space still). So I thought: why not just try to pack everything into my daypack? I had a [great onebag trip to Europe last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/x58kx9/europe_2_weeks_september_my_onebag_is_too_big/) but found myself thinking that my backpack was still too heavy and bulky, so this time I want to optimize for weight and size.\n\nSo, here is a first pass of packing my [Matador Freefly16 Packable Backpack](https://matadorup.com/products/freefly16-2) for 2 weeks in Tokyo and Kyoto!

The toothpaste goes into a  refillable  toothpaste tube that is stored inside of the handle of the toothbrush,  so you can fill it with whatever toothpaste you want instead of buying  minis.

Will probably thrift some kind of small pouch.\n* 2x Baggu face mask\n* Eye mask for sleeping\n\nNotes:\n\n* All  of my accommodations have laundry so I plan on doing laundry every 4-5  days (2-3 times during the 2 week period). This definitely allows me to  be able to pack less clothes.\n* During  my last trip to Japan during this same time of the year, the weather  was hot and rainy. I did not find myself needing a jacket other than a  rain jacket. The fact that it‚Äôll be ‚Äúsingle layer‚Äù weather allows me to  pack less clothes also.\n* I‚Äôm  going into this confidently knowing that I‚Äôll be able to buy anything  once I‚Äôm there, hence deliberately packing maybe a little less than I  need (one less t-shirt, no mid-weight jacket, less socks, etc).\n* Disclaimer:  I will probably also bring an empty packable duffel bag to bring back  souvenirs, so the trip back is not going to be a onebag trip.\n* A travel adapter is not needed because I‚Äôm traveling from the US and the plug is the same.\n* Physical e-sim and removal tool is not needed because I use e-sim cards.\n* Not pictured: Pilot G2 0.38 pen, plastic bag to use as dirty clothes bag, passport and some other docs/printouts, Apple AirTag.",

        "selftext": "Got in the new Matador Globerider 35 yesterday in garnet, an awesome colorway. Did some test loading and carrying (about 18 pounds of gear) and the harness felt fantastic, especially with the hip belt engaged. \n\nThings I Love:\n\n-the colorway\n\n-dual access to the main compartment makes this easy to pack smart, and get quick access to whatever you leave on top, along with the laptop\n\n-the harness is fantastic. Wide, thickly padded straps, load lifters, micro-adjustable sternum strap, and a really nice hip belt make this a very comfortable carry. Doubt I‚Äôll really need the hip belt but definitely a nice option to stow it or remove it. \n\n-has just the right amount of organization. The two bottom pocket on the inside of the lid have built in volume to them. Was able to fit my Gravel Mini and Evergoods CAP.5 in one without issue or impeding on the main compartment. \n\n-tons of attachment points, counter pulls, and zipper security loops\n\n-top QAP is felt lined for sunglasses or other scratchable items\n\n-front admin pocket fits a CAP1 plus items in the built in pocketing. This does reduce the effectiveness of the top split pocket inside the lid. \n\n-hidden pocket in back panel is perfect for an AirTag and your passport\n\n-the bottle pocket is great stretch mesh and the loop on it for easy access is a nice addition\n\n\nThings I Wished It Had:\n\n-wish they had kept the grid pattern bottom of the 45\n\n-would have rather a 2nd water bottle pocket over the side handle since there‚Äôs already 4 handles on the front\n\n-wish it had compression straps inside to really flatten out my Peak Design cubes but not a big deal",

            "body": "This was a silly packing list, intentionally going beyond what I would normally pack, even for a work trip, to try and simulate the amount of space a normal-sized person would use for clothing. I am 5‚Äô0‚Äù but the SEG 28 still seems way bigger than the 28L suggests. Spent a week in an apartmenty-hotel, this bag held everything I needed in addition to things I didn‚Äôt. Full pourover setup (grinder, funnel, filter, titanium cup) and a Tom Bihn Daylight Briefcase. \n\n##The Why\n\nI kinda just wanted to try something new. The SEG line got a lot of attention with its rectangular chonky compartmentalized design. Big complaint with the SEG30 was that it was flimsy and not very comfortable, and the SEG28 claims to be much more comfortable. I say, my [Vapour Overnighter](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5054-188/vapour-overnighter-pack) is perfectly usable despite these complaints‚Ä¶ but sure, let‚Äôs see what an extra $100 worth of backpack over the SEG30 gets you. \n\n##Backpack Stuff\n\nThe SEG28 has really beefy straps and Aquaguard style water-resistant zippers all around. It also has a luggage pass-through on the side, along with sternum straps and hip straps. \n\nOne side has a stretchy water bottle pocket and the other has a handle. In fact, there‚Äôs handles everywhere on this bag. Two haul handles on the top and bottom of the SEG portion to lift it like a duffel, and a webbing loop where you would normally expect one on a backpack. Both sides have fantastic compression straps. \n\nLooking inside, the SEG portion can be cinched down - [attach the mini G-hook into a webbing loop](https://i.imgur.com/cKsCkF8.jpg). There‚Äôs not much else going on in here. The small stash pocket on the top has a small zippered pocket inside it as well. Pockets inside pockets. It also shares volume with the main compartment, so a fully packed SEG28 is going to be difficult to access.It also has a padded, suspended laptop compartment. It works, I guess. I goofed up and tried to stuff my laptop in the top stash pocket, it went in about halfway.\n \n##Packing it Out\n\nThis is where the rubber hits the road, and where I think the SEG design starts to show its shortcomings. Each of the compartments shares space, for better or worse. On the way there, I folded up most of my thicker layers and put them inside the main compartment. Everything else went into the segments. On the way back, everything went into the main compartment.\n\nThe harness is fantastic, as far as travel backpack harnesses go. One shoulder, two shoulder, both fine. But the only difference between this and my MEC bag is that it feels more *reassuring.* It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the weight is all on my shoulders, nor does it do anything to distribute the pressure better. The side carry handles and top/bottom handles allow you to chuck it like a duffel bag, but don‚Äôt provide much support or structure. Best to carry it like a backpack. \nThere‚Äôs [convenient paracord loops](https://i.imgur.com/47KQhpP.jpg) on the zipper runs that help you open and close the zippers, and you can stick the pulls through to ‚Äúlock‚Äù them closed.

            "body": "This was a silly packing list, intentionally going beyond what I would normally pack, even for a work trip, to try and simulate the amount of space a normal-sized person would use for clothing. I am 5‚Äô0‚Äù but the SEG 28 still seems way bigger than the 28L suggests. Spent a week in an apartmenty-hotel, this bag held everything I needed in addition to things I didn‚Äôt. Full pourover setup (grinder, funnel, filter, titanium cup) and a Tom Bihn Daylight Briefcase. \n\n##The Why\n\nI kinda just wanted to try something new. The SEG line got a lot of attention with its rectangular chonky compartmentalized design. Big complaint with the SEG30 was that it was flimsy and not very comfortable, and the SEG28 claims to be much more comfortable. I say, my [Vapour Overnighter](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5054-188/vapour-overnighter-pack) is perfectly usable despite these complaints‚Ä¶ but sure, let‚Äôs see what an extra $100 worth of backpack over the SEG30 gets you. \n\n##Backpack Stuff\n\nThe SEG28 has really beefy straps and Aquaguard style water-resistant zippers all around. It also has a luggage pass-through on the side, along with sternum straps and hip straps. \n\nOne side has a stretchy water bottle pocket and the other has a handle. In fact, there‚Äôs handles everywhere on this bag. Two haul handles on the top and bottom of the SEG portion to lift it like a duffel, and a webbing loop where you would normally expect one on a backpack. Both sides have fantastic compression straps. \n\nLooking inside, the SEG portion can be cinched down - [attach the mini G-hook into a webbing loop](https://i.imgur.com/cKsCkF8.jpg). There‚Äôs not much else going on in here. The small stash pocket on the top has a small zippered pocket inside it as well. Pockets inside pockets. It also shares volume with the main compartment, so a fully packed SEG28 is going to be difficult to access.It also has a padded, suspended laptop compartment. It works, I guess. I goofed up and tried to stuff my laptop in the top stash pocket, it went in about halfway.\n \n##Packing it Out\n\nThis is where the rubber hits the road, and where I think the SEG design starts to show its shortcomings. Each of the compartments shares space, for better or worse. On the way there, I folded up most of my thicker layers and put them inside the main compartment. Everything else went into the segments. On the way back, everything went into the main compartment.\n\nThe harness is fantastic, as far as travel backpack harnesses go. One shoulder, two shoulder, both fine. But the only difference between this and my MEC bag is that it feels more *reassuring.* It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the weight is all on my shoulders, nor does it do anything to distribute the pressure better. The side carry handles and top/bottom handles allow you to chuck it like a duffel bag, but don‚Äôt provide much support or structure. Best to carry it like a backpack. \nThere‚Äôs [convenient paracord loops](https://i.imgur.com/47KQhpP.jpg) on the zipper runs that help you open and close the zippers, and you can stick the pulls through to ‚Äúlock‚Äù them closed. Those Aquaguard-style zippers make it difficult to get things inside without scratching my hands though.

Best to carry it like a backpack. \nThere‚Äôs [convenient paracord loops](https://i.imgur.com/47KQhpP.jpg) on the zipper runs that help you open and close the zippers, and you can stick the pulls through to ‚Äúlock‚Äù them closed. Those Aquaguard-style zippers make it difficult to get things inside without scratching my hands though. In terms of organization, the single slash pocket into each compartment limits my ability to fold clothes cleanly. Everything‚Äôs nice and stacked until I have to squeeze it inside the compartment‚Ä¶ unless I use the main compartment and give up the segmentation. # ComparisonsWhen I got home, I put the full SEG28‚Äôs contents into the [Patagonia Black Hole 40L](https://i.imgur.com/zoqsQ5y.jpg), and the [MEC Vapour Overnighter (33L).](https://i.imgur.com/M2B4eXD.jpg) The Black Hole could handle a 1-2L more, but the Vapour Overnighter was a fight to get everything to fit and it tends to be quite spacious. I‚Äôd say the Black Hole 40 is overestimating its volume, the MEC is accurate, and the SEG28 is underestimating for comfort. The SEG28 measured at 1050g (2.3 lb), as opposed to the Vapour Overnighter at 910g (2.0 lb) and the Patagonia at 930g (2.1 lb). I think this is where it really shines - it‚Äôs not super lightweight, but it‚Äôs close to ‚Äúbackpacks‚Äù that have practically no organization and a simpler harness. Compare this to the Aer Travel Pack 3 Small at 3.6 lb. \n\n##Verdict\n\nFrom a user‚Äôs perspective, I wouldn‚Äôt say no to it. It does a good job at backpack things, it looks nice, and it keeps everything organized. \n\nThe thing is: I would be happier paying less for most of the features being absent. Rather than the compression or a velcro luggage pass-through, I would prefer a way to retain my backpack straps if I go full duffel mode, and maybe a little webbing loop to keep it on a roller bag, like the [Able Carry Max.](https://ablecarry.com/products/max) \n\nBeing pigeonholed into a specific volume wasn‚Äôt an issue, each of the segments have enough wiggle room. I just didn‚Äôt like how the segments were laid out - they‚Äôre too big for random stuff, yet too small/difficult to access for replacing packing cubes entirely. When packing a SEG section out, I just kept putting things in until nothing more fit. It seems like Matador set out to make this a true do-everything bag. I think it works best if you put any ‚Äúlarge foldable‚Äù items like shirts and pants and packing cubes in the main compartment, leaving the segments for everything else. Not the best for any specific application, but respectable for everything. ",

Pretty sure the Vapour line only showed up for a single release, it just came and went away shortly afterward. I think the fabric only works well in a \"big bucket bag\" format unless you give it a liner, but it was great. Feels like the functional equivalent of X-Pac, but cheaper. Stiff, not prone to peeling like thicker tarpaulin-type fabric. Almost like they made it from some heat-weldable stuff or the Matador FlatPak fabric. \n\nI agree that Matador is a little overhyped, they don't show up as *often* but it's almost always a purely positive comment. I've still been checking back and trying to see if there's anything they make that I want, maybe the Speed Stash for my hiking pack.",

I've always been intrigued by the SEG line and its unique look and pocket system. \n\nYeah, the common critique about bag compartments is that they often share each other's space, such that filling up one will make it difficult to fill or access the adjacent one. The only one I remember reading that didn't have this problem was Tom Bihn, specifically their bags with 3D pockets. For the SEG and many others, underfilling each compartment is probably the way to deal with it, but I'll be the first to admit this is easier said than done. \n\nP.S.

Its \"egg\" shape is held together by the ballistic shell, with roomier liner fabric inside forming the compartments. But the nice part about the Synapse is that you can see that the pockets are way shallower, and you can still get into each pocket. \n\nThe slash compartment on the SEG 28 is so large + flat and extends so far down (about 2/5 of the way down the bag) that you can put something in, then struggle to get it back out if the bag is anywhere near fully packed. Same goes with loading anything into the topmost compartment if the SEG 28 is already full, I had masks + snacks in there and had to rummage around a bit before being able to grab them.",

            "body": "The Beast28 is one of my favorites for sure, here are some comments for people who have been considering it or just interested. These thoughts pretty much all apply to the smaller Beast18 as well because the only difference between the Beast18 and the Beast28 is the size. Oh, and the Beast18's removable hip belt doesn't have stretchy pockets. (I bought this bag with my own money, btw).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The **flexible internal wire frame** is amazing and the Beast28's secret weapon for sure. Gives the bag some structure and somehow makes the bag attach to my back so even when I have to run with it, I can feel the backpack move along with my body. It's surprisingly one of the most comfortable bags I've used even though the shoulder straps and back panel are so thin. The thin mesh still makes the back panel breathable enough though. I'm not even sure how this bag can be so comfortable, it has to be a combination of the wire frame, the mesh and just the low weight of the bag itself.\n* Probably **the most versatile backpack I've had**. It's advertised as an ultralight technical hiking backpack and it has most features you find in hiking bags, such as daisy chains, gear loops for hiking poles, and it even comes with a REALLY nice and supportive removable hip belt. I'm sure I could even take this bag on an overnight camping trip if I can figure out how to attach the sleeping bag to the bottom of the pack. If you're not looking for lots of organization, it's also a very functional EDC bag and it can obviously be used for trips because it has enough space for packing cubes and toiletries. I know that in the bag community, we often get obsessed with the idea that there has to be a bag that can do it all, and sometimes that idea seems elusive, but this is the closest I've come to finding such a bag. The packability is a bonus for me and not something I necessarily I even need. I got a stuff sack with the bag that can hold the Beast28 when it's compressed, but it's worth noting that because of the wire frame, the Beast28 is a bit bulkier than other packable daypacks when packed. Same goes for the smaller Beast18 as far as I know. Although this is a hiking bag, it doesn't look out of place at the office or in the city because of its understated all-black design. I don't need a 28L bag necessarily for EDC so I've been thinking about getting the Beast18 as well.\n* Worth noting that even though Matador advertises the Beast28 as a mountaineering bag, I've seen comments that the material isn't robust enough to handle constant abrasion. The material is very water-resistant, I got the bottom of the bag really dirty one day and I just briefly submerged the bottom in a river that was nearby. No water got inside, but I've also seen comments that the inside will get wet if there is a long and heavy downpour.\n* The **bottle pockets are brilliant**. Deep and so stretchy that they can even hold my massive two-liter bottle that I occasionally carry.\n* No laptop sleeve inside, but you can fit a smaller 13'' laptop in the water bladder holder, which obviously isn't suspended or padded though. I just keep my laptop in a separate faux leather sleeve and just throw it in the main compartment.\n* I've seen some criticism about the **front compartment**, which goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, but I actually like it quite a bit. It's spacious enough to even hold a jacket and it has its own dedicated space, so if you need to get something from the bottom of the huge front pocket, at least your hand goes in there easily. There's also a smaller pocket at the top of the front compartment for accessories where I keep a Victorinox, a small first aid pack and a pen. There's also a small extra pocket in the bigger main compartment that also has a key loop.\n* Because this bag is made of really thin **210D Robic nylon**, it's still a bag that needs to be packed \"smartly\". If you have something pointy aimed at your back in the main compartment, you fill feel it against your back, and the bag just looks nicest when it's packed full. Being someone who has had many 500D Cordura bags, it sometimes feels like I'm handling a garbage bag when my Beast28 is half-full and I start opening it. I have to say that sometimes I really fumble to find the zipper pulls because they are black and blend in with the rest of the bag so much. The main compartment also has a really long J-shaped zipper that allows the backpack to open half-clamshell, which is a nice bonus. But I've thought about changing the zipper pulls to something more colorful so I can find them more quickly.\n* Oh man, if only this bag had a front mesh stash pocket... that would be the cherry on top.",

I am impressed weekly by how feature packed this thing is in its small package.  \nThe main selling point for me is how well built it is; aestetics, Comfortable, water bladder pocket fits laptops (Apples 13\"), the water bottle pockets and perfect organization layout for a techy EDC.  \nUse it for bicycling with change of clothes, gym shoes and a lunchbox, laptop, 0,8 liter water bottle (side pocket) and tech pouch (side pocket).  \n  \nFor travel I strap it inside the Tasmanian Tiger 45+ (TT 45+ works as euro carry on, with its brain removed) as the TT doesn't have much organization and at the destination walk around all day with the Matador on without getting much of a sweat due to the (for a packable pack) well vented backpanel.  \n  \nI tried the hip belt, it actually (though I shouldn't be surprised) works really well to hold up whatever you can pack into a 18 liter, but removed it after the first day because it wasn't needed for what I use it for.  \n  \nIt holds up well and looks neat both packed to the brim and empty.  \n(edit) I have to disagree with the comment below by \"guttersmurf\", depsite the thinking behind the comment is solid this pack does not sag on your (my) back - the frame is solid under load and without. (/edit)  \n  \nI don't have experience with the other bags you mention so can't speak of where you're coming from, but I'm using mine with heavy loads along with slim load outs and it works really well.  \n  \n(I recently got rid of every bag in my collection in an attempt to narrow down to one bag for everything, but couldn't bring myself to rid of this - its just too perfect (and works as a nice addition inside the onebag TT 45+))  \n(user is 193cm for reference)",

It wont have the same comfort as a hiking pack but it will be much better than like 99% of other packable bags. It really depends on u and if u only wanna use it as an EDC pack or plan on traveling with it as well coz then i would say its worth it but as only an EDC pack i think u miss the opportunities that their stuff really excells at.",

Workmanship was generally alright but they seemed like they put more effort into the aesthetic and marketing than the actual design and durability of the products - dry bags without seam seals and with ultra thin materials compared to less expensive osprey ones I have (bigger ones), travel toiletry bottles with single piece plastic hinges that will snap through use, travel towels (with admittedly useful rubber carry pods) at a huge premium for a microfiber towel over other brands for no better quality or functionality.\n\nI'd recommend the Acteryx Deuter or Osprey if you want this style of pack, they make quality products and the materials are always solid.",

        "selftext": "Yes, backpacks in the picture are of different kinds/purposes, but these are the most illustrative pictures to my question that I managed to find. \n\nPicture on the left. That‚Äôs, from my understanding, the most comfortable way to wear a backpack: tight to the body and somewhat high, so the weight pushes on shoulders from the top rather than pulling them back. Ignore the hip belt for now.\n\nPicture in the middle. Same idea, but the pack is half the size of the previous one, so its top part is lower, while it sits still high. Keep ignoring the hip belt. \n\nPicture on the right. And that is how I see majority of backpacks pictured being worn, except for big backpacking ones. Pack sits lower, straps pull shoulders back, making pack lean away from body and sit even lower, which in turn pull shoulders even further back and so on.\n\nI don‚Äôt find the third pictured way of wearing backpack comfortable. At all. Unless it‚Äôs very light and I‚Äôm carrying for a short period of time, then it‚Äôs okay, not great, just okay. Carrying heavier or longer makes me want to pull backpack closer and tighter (I guess, that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm trying to make load push down on my shoulders and not pull back). To make it sit more comfortably, I end up pulling it so high, that shoulder straps start to rub against my neck and upper traps. Also, that makes straps move apart and kinda sit in armpits; to prevent that I tighten chest strap, which pulls straps closer, putting even more side pressure on the neck.\n\nBackpacks I‚Äôm currently dealing with (and looking to possible update because of the reason above) are REI Ruckpack 18L and 28L. Aer Travel Pack 2 has pretty much the same issue but aided a little by having a waist belt, though not a lot. \nI do lift and have broad shoulders but by no means a big guy at 180lbs and 6ft. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? And how do I fix it?",

            "author": "gabek333",
            "body": "I used to work at REI so let me give a rundown of how to properly wear a backpack.\n\nSo first off, hiking bags and travel bags are made differently. Hiking bags are designed to be worn for long stretches of time and while walking. Travel bags are more convenient for packing (clamshell open vs. top loading) but are not designed to be worn for as long because the assumption is that you will put your bag down on a plane/bus/etc.\n\nThe features reflect this. Every single hiking backpack has (or should have) load lifters. If you look at the middle and left pictures, it's the little adjuster strap between the top of the back and the shoulder strap. These straps pull the upper part of the bag closer to your upper back. Hiking bags also have burly hip belts to evenly distribute weight to the legs and take the stress off of your back and shoulders. The shape is also usually designed to hug your back and therefore is curved to match your spine.\n\nMost of these features would be great on travel bags, but they aren't super practical. The burly hip belt on backpacking bags flops around and cannot really but put away. The curve of the bag is definitely not conducive to carrying laptops. The top loading is challenging for organization on a trip in a city. Even load lifters add weight and dangling straps. Most travel bags have chest straps in lieu of the other features. The chest straps keep your bag from sliding out to your outer shoulders, helping your back. Maybe try loosening the chest strap to where it's comfortable?\n\nThe reality is, though, that most bags of any style under 30 liters don‚Äôt usually have the hiking features because they become a little unnecessary. If the bag is light, there's not much of a need to have the fit be absolutely perfect. I think at 18 liters, those features are excessive. But at 28? Maybe find a bag with those features? Ask yourself if you'd rather have a better carrying experience or organizational experience because you usually sacrifice one.\n\nThe [Osprey Porter 30](https://www.rei.com/product/171302/osprey-porter-30-travel-pack) has load lifters, but I'm not a huge fan of the bag. The [Cotopaxi Allpa 28](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-28l-travel-pack?variant=40467748519997) has those features as well, but reviews are mixed on the bag. Maybe go try it on?\n\nFor any hip belt, you ideally want the top of your hips to be in the middle of the hip belt. Everyone's hips are at different heights so find where yours are. They're usually higher than you expect (a bit higher than where most people wear pants), and usually around the belly button. With the hip belt in the right place, the shoulder strap should be flush with your shoulder (and not have space below). Actually, in the picture on the left, the strap/height of the bag should be adjusted a little bit haha.\n\nI think the first thing you should do is play with your chest strap to find a way where it doesn't cut into your neck. I've found that with my 30L Tom Bihn Aeronaut that I can wear the back for very long stretches (not quite as long as my hiking bags for when I backpack in the backcountry) and it's mostly because that bag rocks and the frame sheet/chest strap keep the bag structured and in place.\n\nIf the chest strap just doesn't work, you probably just need to find a bag with a real hip belt. Don't settle for webbing, that does absolutely nothing. You need a strap at least two fingers in width to transfer weight to your hips and ideally, you would have a rigid frame on the bag as well.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, hope this helped.",

Either in the city or national parks; no wilderness and survival. My load is compact but dense, basically camera gear and water. Most of the time I carry light (\\~2.5kg) and it takes very little space (3-4L) plus water. And occasionally need to carry heavier but still under 30L volume for sure. I don't do anything extreme but go off beaten paths regularly. \n\nSo I want a backpack that I'll carry daily and that will be very comfortable :) And it seems to me more and more that I need a fully featured hiking style one. But carrying 4L load in a 30L or even 20L backpack looks questionable. \n\nWhat would be your advice?",

The logic \"tighter more secure\" might make sense, but in reality It will increase pressure fully on your shoulder muscles. Your body will compensate by leaning forward because of all the weight, &amp; now your whole posture is off balance and will hurt in the long run.\n\nGet the weight off your shoulders, onto your hips. Use the chest/sternum strap to \"float\" your pack off your shoulders. This may result in the top leaning back slightly, but again, you will naturally lean forward. The heavier the pack, the more it's about finding the balance of it all to get the most comfort.",

            "body": "Picked up the Matador Beast18 at REI this weekend and got to take it out this Saturday for a nice 5-ish mile hike. \n\nFirst thing I‚Äôll address is the price. This pack is certainly on the higher end at $135. 20% for the REI Anniversary sale helped though. \n\nFor years I‚Äôve been using a CamelBak Mule as my primary day pack. It may be a bike focused pack, but the 12L size with 3L bladder has always worked well for me. But I have had a few times that I wanted a little more space, so I set out looking for an 18-22(ish)L pack. I also really preferred to use my existing bladder, which did narrow several options. \n\nPros of the Beast18: For me, the size is just right. I was able to carry my 3L bladder, a sizable lunch, running pants, a light jacket, and a raincoat with ease. It all fit nicely and carried very comfortably. The hip belt was the biggest surprise. Great load transfer, but it sits so nicely that I don‚Äôt even think about it being there. I personally love the layout, and there is very little that I would change. It also comes with a stuff sack so the bag can be folded down and carried. I don‚Äôt know how often I‚Äôll use that feature, but it‚Äôs nice to know that it exists. Comfort really is king with this back. The biggest complement that I can give is that if felt very similar to my Mule, and I never really had to think about it. Got it all adjusted before leaving, and never had to think about it or mess with it on the trail. We didn‚Äôt weigh it, but I did load it heavier than my wife‚Äôs 25L Osprey Sportlite, and she was stunned at how compact it was in comparison, especially when she lifted both packs to compare. \n\nPossible cons: I‚Äôm bringing these up because for some people they will be deal breakers. None of these things bothered me, but they are worth mentioning. \nWater bottle pockets are slim. I didn‚Äôt try to shove a standard Nalgene in, but if it does fit it would be tight. These pockets seem very specifically built for Smartwater bottles, or other tall and thin options. Nothing major, but worth noting. \n\nBladder Pocket: my Camelbak 3L Crux fit perfectly, but I‚Äôm not sure every 3L would. The bag width tapers from the shoulders to the hips, so a more rectangular bladder might not fit correctly. With anything smaller, it‚Äôs likely not going to be an issue, but if you carry 3L, it‚Äôs something to consider. \n\nNo shove it pocket: this is probably the number one thing I would change. Having a shove it pocket is nice. I didn‚Äôt need it on this trip, and I might not even need it. But I‚Äôd like it to be an option. The front does have loops down both sides, so I‚Äôll likely add some ties or webbing in the future, but I still think I‚Äôd prefer a shove it pocket. \n\nVenting: I prefer to have the pad on my back, but if you prefer trampoline backs you might notice this more. The bag doesn‚Äôt vent as well as some others I‚Äôve used. On the trail I didn‚Äôt notice it while hiking, but when I took the pack off I noticed that it was more damp than I was expecting. It does vent, but it‚Äôs a trade off for the pack abilities. I‚Äôd say it likely vents better than most packable packs, but a trampoline system will vent a lot more. Again, no issue for me, but others may feel differently. \n\nExcited to have this option in the mix and see how the pack holds up time, but so far I‚Äôm incredibly happy with this purchase!",

Like the Mystery Ranch Blitz 30, which I've tried before, but ultimately returned. Comparable to my colleagues Tasmanian Tiger.   \nStitching is perfect. Unless you are a perfectionist - then there's one slightly asymmetrical stitch on the inside yellow hook liner. Other than that, I haven't noticed any red flags, so to speak.  \nNomad seems to be more up to my speed, when compared to other panel loaders, and I quite like it for what it is. It's nicely compressible, so it will fulfill the role of my 18-30l backpack fairly well. I love rolltops, so I might give a Kahakka 15 a try, too, but after trying and returning or reselling a handful of backpacks, Nomad finally seems to satisfy my very specific needs. \n\nHave you ever used a backpack/bag with a laser-cut MOLLE/PALS like this? If not, be aware that it will feel like crumpling plastic. Don't be scared, it's just how this material works. If it wasn't like that, the laser-fused holes wouldn't hold their shape. It's durable, though, if I may compare it to my longlived pouches.\n\nI hate water bottle pockets. And I just plain don't want them on my backpacks. Which is why I tried to endure J√§√§kari S for over a year. It wasn't bad when worn over a leather jacket or a plate carrier. The worst was how the straps came out of the middle of the backpack on the top (Savotta mitigated this with their Kahakka range).   \nThe Nomad's solution is the only one I even considered. Now, that I have used it, I still keep my Keith water bottle on the inside in the dedicated pockets, but the outside pockets are useful for keeping a kufiya, an umbrella, a random rolled up magazine or  even a smaller soft-cover book you don't care about (remember those? :D). Thick bottle, like the pictured 1 200ml Keith does indeed take away a bit of space on the inside, even if you keep it on the outside. So, I'd rather keep it closer to my back, in order to make the backpack more comfortable.   \nThe other water bottle pocket on the inside is usually occupied by my CountyComm Pen Pouch or flattened spare clothing (usually socks, merino underpants etc.).",

One on the outside, which I use for my gloves (which I can also clip to the inside of the MOLLE/PALS side panels). And the other, larger one, right under. It's big, but not as cavernous as Mystery Ranch \"brains\" on 30L models. It's got loops for your smaller gear/tools, but I'm hard pressed to occupy these with anything, since I'm one of those weird people (considering the sub we find ourselves in) who keep their smaller tools on their person. I'm still looking for something to put in there that I'd actually use. So, I could do without that larger pocket, to be honest. \n\nIf you find yourself walking in the night frequently, all the little points to attach glow-in-the-dark things, or LED lights, are a very useful addition. \n\nHaving watched their Nomad promo video, you might have noticed how the top of the backpack doesn't sit close to the actors shoulders. That's true. It isn't as close fitting in the top half as, let's say, my \"old\" Mystery Ranch Coulee 30.   \nBut, for a good reason. The concept of it is that it's supposed to let your back breathe. I have yet to see how this will work out this summer.   \nIn winter, it was difficult to get used to. And I might still not be used to it. So expect it to feel weird in the top half at first.   \nWhen you stow away the hip belt/strap, it adds more support for your lower back, which helps combat the weird feeling by the shoulders.  \n  \nThe backpack itself isn't as light as 210D Coulee, but it's a fair tradeoff for the comfort it offers.   \n(210D Robic was always a hit or miss for me, since it's a recycled material which can retain smells from the original recycled materials its made out of)  \nThe load-lifters actually work, unlike Eberlestock ones. The hip belt/strap works as nicely as Mystery Ranch ones I've tried, and it might even fit me better for some reason - it feels like it better conforms to my hips. I haven't pinpointed this one, yet, though. I'm tall and slender, so this might not apply to you.\n\nOtherwise, ask away, if there's anything else you'd like to know. There aren't many reviews online, so I'd be more than happy to share my experience :)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/191axlk/review_orbit_gear_c102_sharpshooter/",
        "selftext": "Hey fellow many baggers! My Cyber Monday purchase was this [Orbit Gear Sharpshooter](https://www.orbitgear.id/collections/new/products/c102-mk24-sharpshooter) backpack (mine was the MK23, and they've since updated it to MK24), and now that I've used it for a bit, I have some thoughts. Some necessary contexts: I was looking for a more compact alternative to my North Face Borealis, which was the only bag I had at the time to comfortably carry my Legion 5 15,6\" laptop. I also snagged quite the deal, \\~$30 for this bag in Orbit Gear's homebrand Elecor fabric.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dytnpbme72bc1.jpg?width=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8857a95fe07e361ec08026f358f56582eb686a11\n\n*TLDR:* Nice alternative for a \"budget\" (depending on your shipping location and their current sale) goruck-style bag without going too tacticool. While there are [some questionable design issues](https://imgur.com/a/7lYyCoP), the bag is very well-built and comfortable to carry. Orbit Gear categorised this bag as a Commuter series, but I think with the clamshell opening and the lack of proper quick access to your stuff, the Sharpshooter is better suited for travel instead of EDC / daily driver (it fits underseat a smol A320).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Positive notes:**\n\n* Great overall build. Elecor fabric is just like your typical 580D fabric, reliable but nothing particularly special with it.\n* Stealthy look: nondescript appearance with only a small visible logo label. Molle rows placement on the sides, instead on the front, also helps.\n* Comfortable carry: I thought the straps are a bit too thick at first, but after using it to haul heavy tech gear, I've come to appreciate them.\n* Inclusion of strap keepers! It baffles me that so many bag brands (including some of the more expensive ones) neglect to include strap keepers. Dangling straps ain't pretty.\n* Organised interior: Just enough organisation to separate things, I especially like the side mesh pockets. I'm a pouch user through and through, so I don't need my bags to have 100 built in compartments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Personal nitpicks** (photos of these nitpicks can be [found here](https://imgur.com/a/7lYyCoP)):\n\n* The bag definitely looks its best when it's fully packed. Half-full bag looks sad and a little dorky with the overhanging (too wide?) rain flap above main compartment. I think some compression straps might help with this issue.\n* Tight laptop sleeve access: While the dedicated sleeve fits my 15.6\" device, access can be a real hassle due to the tight zipper curve and stiff rain flap. Needs some wiggling to get the laptop properly removed/inserted, which can be a bit annoying after awhile.\n* Front vertical pocket is alright, but internal organisation is impractical with too many slots and the larger of the slots are covered by zipper edge making them useless.  I ended up just tossing things inside as it is the only quick access pocket on the bag.\n* The elastic of interior middle mesh pocket is loose, not sure if it's a QC problem on mine or a strange design decision (makes an otherwise premium-looking bag feel cheap).\n* There's no way to flatten the carry handle. I think it really detracts from the overall minimalist aesthetic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously the price I paid for this bag made it easier for me to overlook these issues. Honestly I'm not sure if I  would still be as happy with the bag had I paid full retail price. If you're on the fence on this bag (or any Orbit Gear bag in general), I suggest waiting for their regular sale events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The bag has a flat bottom, but a little back heavy with the straps being quite thick. The elecor fabric also doesn't hold its shape that well, so XPac or Cordura versions might stand a little easier.\n\nI know what you mean with other Orbit Gear bags being overkill, their designs look good on pictures, but a little too techninja-y for my daily use (too much form over function). The Sharpshooter still has some of that, but the bag is simple enough to not have that heavy techwear vibe. The sale price also helps, not gonna lie LOL.",

Meanwhile, I went to a trade fair about 10 years ago and got addicted to the game of talking to stall holders long enough for them to offer me a company tote bag with a leaflet and a pen in it. My mum said I was embarrassing her but guess who stole all my hard earned pens, I came home with 12 canvas tote bags and have been proudly advertising for several glamping pod manufacturers for the last decade and I haven't used a plastic bag since! I also got a stack of notepads that they gave out at little seminars they were gosting, they leave them on the seats for people and most people didn't take them?! So I took all of them and still haven't run out of notepaper 10 years later",
