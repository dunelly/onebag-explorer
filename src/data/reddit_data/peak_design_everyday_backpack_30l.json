I’d like to get y’all’s thoughts on it. \n\nThings I love about it:\n1) Compartments and how you can personalize it. They come with 3 dividers and can position them specifically inside. \n2) shoulder straps are magnetic so it’s not in the way when you’re tucking it underneath plane seat or storing the bag itself. \n3) IMO - the design of the bag (color, slick style, etc) is well thought of - lots of pockets where you can store gadgets, etc. \n4) Cool lock feature!",

I generally went back to using my LowePro Streetline unless I need the extra space (like for travelling)\n\nAlso the dividers are kinda so-so. Padding is minimal and if each section isn't full, your lenses are going to rattle around a lot.\n\nedit: also just to add, if you use this for camera gear, and you really do fill it up, it gets pretty heavy. Wouldn't want to walk around all day with it. What I often do is pack a smaller camera sling bag I'll actually want to walk around with when I travel. You can actually fit the Peak Design 6L in it, and access it through the side compartment.",

        "selftext": "Just bought this backpack to add to my collection 🫢. So far I love it, but when I looked it up on this group - not a lot of ppl are a fan. I’d like to get y’all’s thoughts on it. \n\nThings I love about it:\n1) Compartments and how you can personalize it. They come with 3 dividers and can position them specifically inside. \n2) shoulder straps are magnetic so it’s not in the way when you’re tucking it underneath plane seat or storing the bag itself. \n3) IMO - the design of the bag (color, slick style, etc) is well thought of - lots of pockets where you can store gadgets, etc. \n4) Cool lock feature!",

I generally went back to using my LowePro Streetline unless I need the extra space (like for travelling)\n\nAlso the dividers are kinda so-so. Padding is minimal and if each section isn't full, your lenses are going to rattle around a lot.\n\nedit: also just to add, if you use this for camera gear, and you really do fill it up, it gets pretty heavy. Wouldn't want to walk around all day with it. What I often do is pack a smaller camera sling bag I'll actually want to walk around with when I travel. You can actually fit the Peak Design 6L in it, and access it through the side compartment.",

It sounds like you're using travel backpack for EDC as well as travel which is something I might be interested in doing as well. Currently kind of torn between the everyday zip 20L but I think it might be a little bit too small and the 30L travel backpack.\n\nHow does the travel bag handle EDC? Is it possible to access the main compartment by just opening the zippers at the top like a more standard toploading bag or do you really have to put it down and unzip the whole panel to grab something out of it?\n\nAlso what does the travel backpack allow you to pack inside of it that the everyday zip couldn't handle?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Its purely subjective indeed but for me the v1 has that iconic look while the v2 was more of a casual look which maybe made it more appealing to a wider audience, just not for me",

The main reason I returned the V1 was that the fabric on the pads on the lower back started to pill (i.e., I think that's the word) really badly and I was concerned that it was going to tear. According the Peak Design they said that they used more durable fabric on the V2. Is this true? Have you had this issue on your V1?",

I had taken a bold and rare step toward the boundary of this unwritten code by posing my question and immediately heard the click of a landline when her eyes tripped in size and she gasped with excitement.\n\n30 minutes later, I had a tech pouch and backpack ordered from my phone after a thorough tour of every nook and cranny her bag had to offer. \n Now that I have 5+ products, every time someone asks me about my bag, I turn to them and gasp excitedly: “oh my god let me tell you all about it, I’m obsessed!”\n\nIt’s a contagion.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1as05sy/peak_design_travel_backpack_30l_short_review/",
        "selftext": "Hi!  \nSince this subreddit helped me a lot with preparation for my one-bag journey, I decided to contribute back and share all my experience with Peak Design Travel Backpack 30L. I hope my review will be helpful to someone (like other actual reviews here).\n\nA bit about me (just for a better understanding the context). Male, 26yo, 172cm/58kg (don't know how much it is in freedom units), software engineer, live in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nApproximately a month ago I decided to visit [FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/) in Brussels, Belgium. I also had some plans about touring around Europe a bit so a roadmap came up quickly - \"Visit FOSDEM. After that, we can visit other Belgian cities (and probably not only in Belgium)\". Not much planning - exactly what I like.\n\nThis was my first trip with a potentially unlimited time frame, so decided to think a little bit about my requirements for my accessories:\n\n* It **must** fit in onebag. I do not like many bags, I do not like to pay additional costs on low costers for additional carry-on luggage, I do not like messing with many bags in new places, etc. - you already know all these things.\n* It must be a backpack because I like how comfortable they are.\n* It should be a backpack that will be treated as a personal item by airport staff.\n* It should be durable.\n* It shouldn't be ugly.\n* Price is not a (big) problem.\n\nI started with reviewing existing options from [this](https://packhacker.com/guide/best-travel-backpack/) top on PackHacker. Each option from this list I rechecked for actual reviews on this subreddit. I would say it was an excellent strategy - I quickly found  all interesting and neat details about the backpacks.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the backpacks from the list are not available in Europe. The only option is to buy in US and then wait for a delivery. This wasn't my case because I didn't have enough time to wait for delivery (as a professional procrastinator I do all the things as late as possible), and I do not want to buy something expensive without a try.\n\nAt this point, I found Peak Design Travel Backpack 30L. This was one of the few backpacks that was available in Warsaw to try in a non-virtual shop. I quickly went to the shop, tried this backpack, and said \"Buying this one\".\n\nMy item list for this backpack:\n\n* Macbook M1 14 Pro\n* Steam Deck (with the original case)\n   * It consumes a lot of free space in your backpack! But still worth it, IMHO.\n* Sony WH-1000XM5\n   * Actually, almost all the time they are on me but anyway\n* Powerbank Anker 737 24000 mAh + 10000 mAh noname powerbank\n* Shaver (Pitbull Gold Pro)\n* Baseus GaN5 Pro 140 W charger ([link](https://eu.baseus.com/products/gan5-pro-3-ports-usb-c-fast-charger-140w))\n   * It was really difficult to find this one. I checked a lot of reviews - Anker is better but a similar charger from Anker is difficult to find in EU. That's why I ended up ti Baseus. Works pretty well, tbh\n* USB cables, USB flash drives, HDMI cable, etc.\n* T-shirts, socks, pants, etc. - almost all from Uniqlo\n* Toothpaste, deodorant, toothbrush, etc. (because I am too lazy to buy these things locally)\n* Tea Infuser Bottle (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/ONEISALL-Glass-Tea-Infuser-Strainer/dp/B07PKK89XQ) one) + 50g tea\n   * Next time I won't forget a small heater... \n* Small daily backpack. Bought a random one from Samsonite - \"Samsonite Foldable backpack\"\n   * Pretty good thing.\n* Some quick snacks like Snickers\n* Probably something else that I forgot to mention here.\n\nFor packing I didn't use pack cubes (because I don't have them, huh).\n\nOne of my concerns was personal item check compatibility. As for now, I had only two flights with it (LOT Airlines and Brussels Airlines) - both were completely fine, and no one even asked me about my backpack. By the way, I took some photos:\n\nDimension checkers:\n\n[WizzAir checker](https://preview.redd.it/870erjd5evic1.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab3577b20bcdccfdb3465785f1c0598a228293bb)\n\n[Some generic checker](https://preview.redd.it/yf2uojd5evic1.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=591a44bc95591701a8fcf65c2005dc4e9c679369)\n\nFrom Warsaw to Brussels (AFAIK, it was some Boeing):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Not a small thing](https://preview.redd.it/v8rnd4ifevic1.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7912f6079f0f6f3f844b50d40edd6cd73fc2291)\n\nFrom Brussels to Warsaw (it was some Embraer or Airbus):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji1ex89mevic1.jpg?width=964&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8451ffc1559729d022c831f5a6fad7c407f58464\n\nIn each case, the backpack is pushed under the seat as much as possible. The backpack is in a \"zipped\" state (27L configuration). The backpack is not fully packed. The actual load size is about 8.5 kg (bag included).\n\nSome thoughts after 1 week journey with Peak Design over multiple cities and hotels, with airplanes and trains, spending some days for 5+ hours with a full load (see the list above) on the shoulders during the walk around the city before a hotel check-in:\n\n* The amount of free space inside is great.\n* Some people write about the lack of organization inside this Peak Design. For me it was not a problem at all. From my perspective, this backpack has enough organization.\n* I do not miss an additional pocket somewhere outside of the backpack. The only top pocket was enough for my use cases.\n* Bottle handlers on the sides could be better. It can be difficult to insert a bottle there when your bag is fully loaded.\n* The backpack is completely rain-resistant. I spent two days under the rain with it - no issues.\n* The backpack is quite tall (see my photos from a plane).\n* Straps are fine. However, after 4-5 hours with my backpack (8.5 kg, just to remind) - my shoulders needed a short break. Not sure if it is good or bad - just raw numbers.\n* Hiding strap functionality is a nice-to-have feature.\n* Some people report that the way how the backpack is opened is not convenient. IDK, I like how it's done in Peak Design. My use cases (get a Macbook/Steam Deck/something on a top of a backpack) are fully covered.\n* It looks pretty nice!\n\nDue to the weather, it was only a one-week journey - but it's not the end. Maybe in a few months or so I will test this bag once again somewhere else!\n\nInstead of a conclusion. I like my choice and hope that with this one I will see many other places. If you have questions - just ask me and I'll try my best to answer them.",

I am about 6’2 or 187 centimeters and in good shape training frequently in body weight training - packed out it can be heavy for long walks if you decide to carry everything with you - my spouse is shorter at 5’3 and with a hip belt she doesn’t have any issues. I made the mistake of maxing peak designs packing cubes which can get full when packed out - now I use half the clothing I used before and make more deliberate choices - the load is much better for long walks around a city or a country side now - love how it is made for planes and somewhat okay for hiking hard to have it all - but yes love the expansion, the durability and it looks very unassuming. There are more comfortable packs but I love the stow away straps and simple setup and the one zipper to the main compartment. Sometimes when waking from sleeping the lack of compartments make it easier to get important items and less likely for me to lose it in a more complex admin system- I’m not the most intuitive- but thanks for sharing your experience like you I do love the pack and will be trying more from this company",

After all the research, it’s nice to share your findings with other travelers. \n\nI have the PD 45L version, which is too big to be a personal item. For me it’s a carry-on, with a Tom Bihn Pilot as my personal item. \n\nThe airlines I fly aren’t as restrictive, so I’m at liberty to carry a bit more without having to pay extra. \n\nI do love the PD backpack: \n\n• Scrunches down to 30L  \n• Well thought out, access from front, back, top and sides \n• Comfortable to wear, and the straps tuck away when not needed. Adjustable/ removable sternum strap and stowable pivoting waist straps and load lifters\n• Well-built and nice looking, excellent hardware\n• Water resistant\n\nMy only complaint is that with all the gimmicks and design features, it’s rather heavy. But we can’t have everything, and I favor the flexibility. \n\nWith a 20L Aer Day Pack tucked inside, and the 11L Pilot, I can carry quite a bit in comfort without having to check a bag. As a side note, I like that the pilot usually stands up between my feet, under the seat in front of me so I can still stretch out.",

I can usually make due with just the 30L.\n\nAs for the 45L I do like some of the features yours has that the 30L doesn't. It's quite nice to have that extra middle area with the organization and passthrough to the main compartment. If my 30L sacrificed some interior volume for some more organization I'd consider it a worthy trade.\n\nThat being said, I'm in the camp that believes that how big a backpack appears depends on the size of the individual wearing it. Jason momoa can daily drive your 45L without looking strange and airlines might not even blink, but a 5'4\" woman in the 30L would probably look silly in most scenarios.",

I find the EDB especially is difficult to find packing cubes and organizes that fit in with minimal wasted space around inside the bag.\n\nI found a few items that fit like they were made for the bag.\n\nThe first is the [REI Roadtripper Pod - Medium](https://www.rei.com/product/200454/rei-co-op-roadtripper-pod-medium). It measures 10.5\" x 5\" x 5\". Fully packed with 6 t-shirts, it fits nice and snug. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second is the [Tripped Tech Bag Organizer](https://www.amazon.com/Tech-Bag-Electronics-Organizer-Red/dp/B09PFLHWLZ?th=1) which measures 10\" x 4.5\" x 6\". This one is basically a 1:1 copy of the Peak Design Tech Pouch. It's slightly longer and a bit cheaper. It fits very nicely as well. \n\nIt seems like 10.5\" is the sweet spot for width. 5\" for me is the right height so that it fits perfectly into the cubby I have set up for my camera (so I don't have to readjust the origami dividers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPics \n\n[REI Roadtripper Pod Medium - packed with 6 t shirts](https://preview.redd.it/poviplcabbya1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cb9ac953c4f1b574c6690c77eedbc5e31ec4eb1)\n\n[Tripped Tech Bag - empty](https://preview.redd.it/s8ooymcabbya1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a9a495e70a5dbad758e272a7527c7a5b8b3ce4c)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zgsedscabbya1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=385c8e1bb98ff61aeb6f93d9b53917cfd118301e",
