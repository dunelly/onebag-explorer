All the things with plenty of holders, a lightmeter and a filter setup fit comfortably inside the shimoda action v2 50l backpack that I have here and I use a large dslr core unit for it. The bagpack is very comfy and nicely padded. Extra point for the juicy yellow and the option to exchange core units to free/unfree extra space. The tripod is extra since I use a big and heavy one so I usually carry that on my shoulder for ergonimics. I like that the shimoda bagpack has the opening on the back so I don't have to lay it on the side that will be on my back later on. I find it quite good of a space for this big setup with multiple lenses. \nI also took the camera with me on a multi day hike in Finnish Lappland a few weeks ago and managed to fit it all inside the side pockets of a fjäll räven kajka 85L so it was very accessible the whole hike through. You can argue how smart it is to carry that much stuff extra on a week-long hike but I didn't mind. The chamonix camera came inside a padded bag and for the lenses I got a 19in padded square from the long weekend brand. Very good thingy since I fit two lenses inside there. Ofc I had to bring a darkbag and extra film but it was actually quite relaxing reloading in the mornings in the tent xD. I took a graflex back which fits 6 sheets of film but is only 1.5 regular filmholder thicknesses thick. I didn't double expose and I guess my copy is a good one since it didn't clog up or anything. Very happy with all of that. I had a lighter tripod head from benro than what I use usually, but took my induro at413 legs (a bit of luxury has to be) which turned out to be a very good idea since it was very windy.\nDoes anyone have a good solution for storage of exposed film sheets on a trip like this? It is not really a thing to take 15 holders just to take 30 exposures. Maybe I will post some images of my trip here in a few days.\n",

If you don't need battery power, swap out the 300D II for Amaran 200 S. It's \\~80% of the 300D II lumens in a softbox. You can [probably fit 2 of them](https://youtu.be/W4-c6Y74gDs?t=460) in less space than the 300D.\n\nC. Definitely lose the C-stand and get normal lightstands. Get a [convertible](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/513014-REG/Manfrotto_420NSB_420NSB_Convertible_Boom_Stand.html) boom stand that can be a lightstand or hold the mic. There's a heavy duty version as well with a [leveling](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/200109-REG/Avenger_A4041B_A475B_Baby_Combi_Boom.html) leg.\n\nD. Put most of the lighting in a Think Tank Production Manager 50. Pricey but worth it. Great case, holds a ton, but gets heavy if you put all the stands in there.\n\nE. Get a case just for the heavy grip gear. I love this [case](https://www.filmandvideolighting.com/sachtler-c-stand-bag.html), but it seems out of stock or discontinued. I do NOT put C-stands in it, they take up too much space. Edit: Here's Think Tank's [alternative](https://www.thinktankphoto.com/products/stand-manager-52).\n\nF. Carbon fiber tripod.\n\nG. Make the case for a PA. Even in a large city, you can get one for $250 for a 10-hour day.\n\nH. Bigger backpack, maybe Shimoda Action 50 liter. Edit: They make an Action X70. You could fit all of your camera and audio gear in that.\n\nWith 2 Think Tank cases, a really big backpack and some equipment swapping, you can get everything in 3 items and ditch the cart.",

The golf case is your single bulkiest item, so getting rid of that might make your load feel lighter and more compact.  \nNext would be the Pelican case. If at all possible, consider a camera bag like those from Portabrace made for ENG or 'fully assembled' rigs. If you can pre-assemble a rig, and then just keep some of the extra bits/lenses in a smaller case or side pockets will speed up your setup. Having a big case encourages you to take more stuff.   \nAlso, consider replacing the octoboxes with either a 42\" umbrella (super compact) or rectangular softbox (I use a 3x4', that folds very thin, owing to having only 4 support poles).   \n\n\nI've got even more on my cart for a typical interview shoot, but because everything stacks well, it doesn't seem as onerous . The moving blanket is draped over the top and then mini ratchet straps tie everything down. I'm even able to throw in 60-80lbs worth of sandbags on the Rock n Roller R12 cart.  \n\n\nYou can see my typical load-in here: [https://imgur.com/a/pE471Yh](https://imgur.com/a/pE471Yh)",

I've tried to winnow it down over time to make sure I'm just bringing what's necessary with a *little bit* of backup / emergency gear.

They seemed cool with it since out of pocket cost would be under $1k if I manage to sell the gear we have to help fund it.  \n  \nGoing to ditch the wireless lavs and go for more of the DR-10Ls since I've found them more dependable, going to swap GH5 for BMPCC 6K Pro since I already have native EF glass, lose the Zoom recorder (BMPCC has mini-XLR and phantom power), get a short boom stand, buy a Pelican Storm iM2975 and lid organizer which should house almost everything, buy a Think Tank 50 or 52 for light stands, sell the Aputure and replace with Amaran 200x and 100x, probably some more stuff that I'm forgetting. I also got the OK to tell account managers to bill clients an extra $250 so I can hire a PA for any shoots that are longer than half a day or require a lot of setup. Thanks for the tips everyone - I think I took a little advice from all of you in this new build. Might post a before / after in a few months if all goes according to plan and the new kit looks nice and consolidated versus my current loadout.",

The reason I like the Champ is because of its icon status (every young dude wanted one when I was growing up) as well as its the biggest of the practical SAKs (IMO). I bought one for my son when he turned 10 and he loves it. My only real drama with it is that it has several tools that I think are either redundant or infrequently useful. But when I see it I just get waves of nostalgia so I'll probably get one of my own. Not going to lie though, I do find the thickness impedes the handling of the main blade occasionally.",

This was year ago when the gear was huge and filled two cases plus the tripod.    We went 2 hours ahead in an open canoe, so we could set up and wait for the comany's rafts.  We dumped the canoe and the cases took a swim through some white water and rocks.   We swam it all to shore and opened up the cases and set up the shot.      Same when I did underwater work.    SOme one is always going to drop a tank or some wet stuff soaking on saltware on you stuff.   But if it is in a hard case, I don't care.   The routine was always to rinse the case with fresh water BEFORE you open it EVERY time,  Dive boats always have a large tub of fresh water just for this purpose",
