                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

Does it feel heavy on your shoulders? \n* Would you see yourself carrying this entire loadout for extended _(&gt;1 hour)_ periods of time, uninterrupted?\n* Ultimately, do you think you'll travel/keep travelling with this bag?\n* Why not handwash?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've only tested the backpack in-stores _(with sandbags to test weight and capacity)_ and my own feedback echoes yours - \n\n* Didn't feel breathable due to the back panel material\n* The center of gravity was too far in the back and kinda pulling me backwards\n* Overall comfort was not _terrible_ but it didn't feel like a a solid bag for extended carry\n* While on paper I thought it'd be great, I actually found the integrated compartmentalization underwhelming - it is shared volume so depending on your packing cubes/pouches it can dig into the other compartments - but on the upside, with _proper_ pouches/cubes, it could be solid. But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

Does it feel heavy on your shoulders? \n* Would you see yourself carrying this entire loadout for extended _(&gt;1 hour)_ periods of time, uninterrupted?\n* Ultimately, do you think you'll travel/keep travelling with this bag?\n* Why not handwash?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've only tested the backpack in-stores _(with sandbags to test weight and capacity)_ and my own feedback echoes yours - \n\n* Didn't feel breathable due to the back panel material\n* The center of gravity was too far in the back and kinda pulling me backwards\n* Overall comfort was not _terrible_ but it didn't feel like a a solid bag for extended carry\n* While on paper I thought it'd be great, I actually found the integrated compartmentalization underwhelming - it is shared volume so depending on your packing cubes/pouches it can dig into the other compartments - but on the upside, with _proper_ pouches/cubes, it could be solid. But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

When moving I also had the feeling that the shoulder straps are constantly slideing down my shoulders and I do not like buckle the strenum strap all the time :)\n\nI will send the backpack back b/c of the mentioned problems and have decided for the Patagonia Balck Hole mini MLC 30, this I have also packed out with the exact same things and tested (what will post in the coming days).\n\nI have not tried myself doing laundry on my oen yet :) maybe I'll get a bigger drybag and give it a try but in the siffy sinks? ....

My 14 inch MacBook Pro just fits in the separate laptop compartment width wise. There is plenty of room length wise. At 20, inches, it is a bit longer, but I have a long torso. It is a squishy bag that does not seem like 20 inches. Apparently, people use it as a personal item on a plane. The main feature of the bag is the built in packing cube segments, with designated capacities: 4,6, 8, and 10. These compartments are great for teaching: pens and dry erase markers in one pouch, tech in another, etcâ€¦.",
