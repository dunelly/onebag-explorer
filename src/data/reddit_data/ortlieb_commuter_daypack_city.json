I have watched videos on YouTube and got some small items but don't really have a good way to store them. So some pouches would also be good to get for organising everything, but this post is for the main bag only.\nMy current backpack is a cheap Adidas backpack that is very used; uncomfortable and unorganised, I got it a few years ago after my old backpack broke (I had very little money back then and needed a new bag fast, now I'm a little bit better off but I don't really have a decent income, since I'm still an apprentice in Germany).\n\n\nMost of the time I'm travelling around urban areas with public transport by bike or with a e-scooter and of course on foot.\nI want to use this bag for EDC + commuting and light travel (1-3 days or smth like that), maybe even some URBEX and going outside into nature. \nI'm also probably starting to go to the gym in the next few months so a wet/dry compartment for shoes and dirty clothing would be a good feature.\n\nSo I'm looking for a waterproof / water resistant bag, that is made of durable materials that can also take some abuse and last for years.\nI prefer metal hardware like aluminium, but plastic is also fine though.\nIt should be well padded so I can carry it throughout the whole day if needed, and it should also have a detachable hip belt and sternum strap.\nIt should be decent looking, so no tactical bags or extremely odd designs (I don't want to completely stand out).\nIt should have some organisational pockets and stuff like that, so no bag where you just throw everything in one big hole.\nIt should have at least one outside water bottle pocket and a wet/dry compartment for dirty shoes/clothing.\nIt should have a padded and suspended laptop compartment.\nI also plan to pack: a tech kit; a hygiene kit when travelling; a first aid kit / IFAK; a small repair kit and a small survival kit.\nIt should be able to fit spare clothing (underwear; socks; a shirt or a hoodie/pullover; pants, gloves and a hat as well as a packable rain jacket).\nIt should be able to carry a helmet.\nAnd of course as you might have guessed, it shouldn't be too small.\n\n\nCurrently my best bet from my own research is the Unit 1 gear Torch backpack. It's pretty much a match tbh and I like it's look. And I can get it for 189$ which are approximately 178.27 € soon.\n\nHas someone read or watched anything about it or has some experience of their own with this bag?\n\nIt originated from a Kickstarter campaign in 2021, the updated version is now for sale on their website ( https://unit1gear.com/products/torch-backpack-smart-light?variant=43320593088673 ). Since I have backed their Aura smart helmet + smart light system on Kickstarter, I can add it as an Add-on at the end of this month when they send out the survey for size and colour of the helmet which would be way cheaper and more convenient than buying it on its own.",

The backpacks look sharp and well made, really like the design. It is priced at 250€ which is a hefty price in my opinion. I was wondering if anyone had a chance to try it. What do you think ?",

I’d like it to be very sleek, fashionable, and minimal (I don’t like lots of handles/front zippers). I also prefer a leather or leather-like finish vs canvas. It needs to fit my 16” Macbook and my budget is up to £200. I’ve attached pics of the aesthetic I’m going for. I LOVED the Kapten and Son black and cream one but unfortunately reviews said it isn’t very durable. Would really appreciate your recommendations! Thanks",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone, I recently started commuting to work (1hr ride one way 5 days a week) and am looking for a long-term backpack solution.\n\nI have seen many suggesting panniers over backpacks, but in my case backpacks would be better overall.\n\nI have narrowed down my selection to 3 packs, this is where I would need your input.\n\n* [Ortlieb Daytime Commuter](https://www.ortlieb.com/commuter-daypack-urban-line)\n\nLove the form factor and that it is fully waterproof, but not too sold on the roll top design as somewhat makes quickly accessing my stuff a bit of a difficulty. \nNot sure about ventilation at the back area\n\n* [Osprey Metron](https://www.ospreyeurope.com/shop/gb_en/osprey-metron-26-2019)\n\nLove the organisation options and the overall aesthetics of the bag. The added raincover is nice to have even if putting it on is a minor annoyance compared to the Ortlieb's no-worry waterproof construction.\nJust like with the Ortlieb, I have questions on the Airscape back panel - I imagine it provides better breathability compared to Ortlieb's design, but perhaps ends up losing out to the Radial's Airspeed back panel\n\n* [Osprey Radial](https://www.ospreyeurope.com/shop/gb_en/osprey-radial-34-2019)\n\nThe Airspeed back panel is definitely the selling point in my eyes when it comes to the Radial. I would definitely prefer the Metron's aesthetics over the Radial's and just like with the Metron, the added rain cover is a minor annoyance compared to Ortlieb's Daypack.\n\nIs the Airspeed back panel that much superior compared to the Airscape?",

I love the features of the Metron, large compartments for change of clothes, my lunch, separate shoe compartment... The side pockets are great in case I need to grab something without taking the entire back off, like sunglasses, or phone. Like all Osprey bags, the straps are very adjustable and even with heavy loads, the backpack is not an incumcrance to me on the bike, and feels more like and extension of my body. \n\nThe Airscape panel is light-years better than my regular backpack, where I was soaking my clothes in fair temps, whereas with the Metron I am still sweating through my shirt, but not nearly as bad. The straps of the Metron, however, do not provide much protection when it comes to sweat, though the straps do dry quickly.\n\nI wear athletic clothing during my commute in the hot weather (85-100F) I am still waiting for the temps and humidity to drop below 80 to see if I can commute in my normal work shirt without completely sweating through. If I did not have a way to change clothes or shower at work, I probably would have opted for a bag with the airspeed option to better minimize sweat.",

The airspeed + suspension is really beneficial when the load is heavy.

Look for bags with fewer parts that will flap or catch. Rolltop bags are popular, for good reason. I also recommend a fully waterproof bag because if you ride in the rain, your bag will catch a LOT of spray. \n\nUltimately it’s all personal preference, so no one is wrong for using a pannier or the bag you suggested!",

Workmanship was generally alright but they seemed like they put more effort into the aesthetic and marketing than the actual design and durability of the products - dry bags without seam seals and with ultra thin materials compared to less expensive osprey ones I have (bigger ones), travel toiletry bottles with single piece plastic hinges that will snap through use, travel towels (with admittedly useful rubber carry pods) at a huge premium for a microfiber towel over other brands for no better quality or functionality.\n\nI'd recommend the Acteryx Deuter or Osprey if you want this style of pack, they make quality products and the materials are always solid.",

Some of the features are similar to TNF backpacks. Plenty of organization, quality materials, easy to carry, etc. \n\nI can also compare it with the new version of TNF Router. IMO, the new TNF material is not as durable as the older models, TNF now has 210D Nylon and Thule Paramount Commuter has 420D Nylon. Overall, the new TNF material is lighter weight but less rugged.\n\nA 30L backpack is probably the limit for crowded spaces for me although I've never had a problem with it. I do have to say that I also found my Thule backpack rather compact when compared to my old Recon (Paramount Commuter is 27L, Recon is 30L).",

The problem with all the popular Reddit options is that these are hard to get when I live, the Raven seems to be the most affordable and easiest to get for me.",

Other Alpaka products are amazing, I am waiting to get alpaka zip clutch in few days. Those are built amazing. Same as you, I had narrowed my options to Raven and skule. Skule seemed to tactical for taking it to work so I decided on Raven. Ordered 20l, immediately returned it, it was way to small( I am 1,8m 80kg). It was so small I couldn’t fit in my 15inch laptop( dell 7540). Retured it, ordered 28l, super satisfied. Difference is that 28l have more organisation and dedicated pocket for laptop. Material is amazing, but I am not sure how it’ll handle rain, it doesn’t look like it’s built for it but we’ll see. Anyway, I am loving it so far and hopefully it’ll last long time. In case you are wondering, raven actually have smaller footprint compared to other backpacks, it’s bit narrower. You can check on youtube differences between 20l and 28l, you’ll see 28l is not that bigger.",
