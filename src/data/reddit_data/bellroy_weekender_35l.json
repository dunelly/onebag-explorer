It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

            "body": "Mockup packing list here, for a physical demonstration of how different bag volumes handle various items. \nAll of the packing cubes are filled to ~80-90% of max capacity with socks/t-shirts, enough to prevent contents from shuffling around without calling for delicate re-folding when you leave. Estimated total volume is 35L. \n\nIncluded are: \n\n* MEC Small organizer pouch with a mouse and charging peripherals  \n* Homemade \"pencil pouch\" toiletry bag  \n* REI small packing cube  \n* Peak Design small packing cube  \n* Tom Bihn Daylight Briefcase with a Macbook Pro 13\" inside  \n* Tom Bihn Western Flyer Packing Cube \n* Uniqlo Robic Sling with a spare battery and some assorted t-shirts stuffed inside  \n* 2 hoodies  \n* Uniqlo Heattech Pants + Joggers (Womens Small)\n* 1 pair of jeans\n* Tom Bihn Travel Tray Large\n\nThis is more than double what I'd normally bring, but the goal was to see just how much capacity these backpacks have AND account for the fact that most of the people on this subreddit are a good 6-12 inches taller than me. Usually all my spare t-shirts and small clothing items will go into the Peak Design cube, then pants and outer layers get rolled and stuffed in whatever corner is free. Unfortunately, I do not have larger packing cubes, and they'd take up all of the space in some of the smaller bags' main compartments. \n\nMontbell Tri-Pack Mini at 18L holds exactly what I want, where I want. There's still 2 zippered compartments and one stash pouch in the main compartment for stashing small things. I have a sling, a shoulder bag, a laptop, and a set of sleepwear inside as \"luxury items.\" And the bag comfortably closes up.\n\nULA Spark is rated to 20L in the main compartment. Overstuffed and using the side pockets, it fits a bit more than that reasonably securely, I'd guess around 23-24L? This is *not* going to fit in a carry-on sizer though. \n\nTom Bihn Western Flyer struggled to fit the sling inside, but overall it *does* have noticeably more capacity than the Tri-Pack Mini. Those pants are bulky. About the same overall capacity as the Spark, but this is packed to the point that the bag is a little uncomfortable on my back. \n\nAnd finally, the MEC Vapour Overnighter fit everything besides that REI small packing cube. If I packed things in a bit tighter, the REI cube might make it in as well. The only place to stash small things like a phone or wallet are the front zip pocket, or opening up the entire bag and trying to access the laptop compartment suspended in the middle (which I didn't use).\n\nI am pretty disappointed that MEC didn't do another run of the Vapour line. It was a solid competitor to the Arc'teryx and Patagonia Black Hole lines of TPU laminated bags, the grippy lining texture just didn't make for a good daypack.",

It rained the other day and felt confident with it. It hasn't been as comfortable as I thought but still may need to break the shoulder strap in.

Its pretty good, but I want to find something that will also hold my 11” iPad. \n\nIve been looking for awhile but hoping for some community wisdom\n\n**current situation**\nI like the Pakt sling’s minimal organization, good materials, and flexibility. Its surprisingly able to hold a bunch of stuff and also not be too bulky when there is a smaller load. It doesn’t have any compression straps, so a carabiner is somewhat helpful. Its kind of close, it fits my A5 notebook but just won’t fit my iPad when I need it occasionally. It also has a strap storage area which makes a handy extra pocket sometimes.\n\n**looking for**\nI would like something quite similar to the Pakt bag but just slightly bigger that can fit my iPad Pro 11” with magic keyboard case (can be a tight fit, so its not too big). Even though it would hold my ipad, I don’t really want a lot of padding. Just something lightweight and minimal/limited organizing. Ideally it would be expandable/compressible or have some compression straps to keep it small, and to hold a jacket/tripod/waterbottle on the outside. This would also make it easy for me to hold all my necessities with me while traveling without having to pull things out of my main backpack. \n\nI also have a Slimfold Sling Pack from KS, which holds my iPad fine and is the similar size but is kind of crap at holding any of the rest of my stuff. The main compartment opening it just too restrictive.\n\n**considered**\n- Bellroy Venture Sling 9L or 6L or 10L camera ed\n- Bellroy Cinch Mini-Messenger 6L (new unknown)\n- Bellroy Lite Sling 7L\n- Alpaka Go Sling 5.5L (might be too small)\n- Alpaka X Sling 6L or Sling Max 10L (dislike the integrated usbA port and might be too big)\n- Nomadic Navigator Collapsible Sling 6L (not sure it will hold up to long term EDC use)\n- something from tomtoc or similar brand\n\nMaybe:\n- Peak Design Outdoor Sling 7L (not sure it fits ipad and looks quite big)\n- Topo Designs Quick pack 7.3L (not sure it fits iPad)\n- Alpaka metro crossbody 10L (more backpack-ish)\n- Osprey Daylite Sling 6L (more backpack-ish)\n- Patagonia Atom Sling 8L (backpackish and maybe too big)\n\nId love to have any insights from the community on the above packs and any recommendations for ones i haven’t considered yet.

        "selftext": "I currently use the Pakt Anywhere Sling (5L v1, before the Everyday 5L v2) for both my EDC and for my personal item when flying (usually with one large travel backpack). Its pretty good, but I want to find something that will also hold my 11” iPad. \n\nIve been looking for awhile but hoping for some community wisdom\n\n**current situation**\nI like the Pakt sling’s minimal organization, good materials, and flexibility. Its surprisingly able to hold a bunch of stuff and also not be too bulky when there is a smaller load. It doesn’t have any compression straps, so a carabiner is somewhat helpful. Its kind of close, it fits my A5 notebook but just won’t fit my iPad when I need it occasionally. It also has a strap storage area which makes a handy extra pocket sometimes.\n\n**looking for**\nI would like something quite similar to the Pakt bag but just slightly bigger that can fit my iPad Pro 11” with magic keyboard case (can be a tight fit, so its not too big). Even though it would hold my ipad, I don’t really want a lot of padding. Just something lightweight and minimal/limited organizing. Ideally it would be expandable/compressible or have some compression straps to keep it small, and to hold a jacket/tripod/waterbottle on the outside. This would also make it easy for me to hold all my necessities with me while traveling without having to pull things out of my main backpack. \n\nI also have a Slimfold Sling Pack from KS, which holds my iPad fine and is the similar size but is kind of crap at holding any of the rest of my stuff. The main compartment opening it just too restrictive.\n\n**considered**\n- Bellroy Venture Sling 9L or 6L or 10L camera ed\n- Bellroy Cinch Mini-Messenger 6L (new unknown)\n- Bellroy Lite Sling 7L\n- Alpaka Go Sling 5.5L (might be too small)\n- Alpaka X Sling 6L or Sling Max 10L (dislike the integrated usbA port and might be too big)\n- Nomadic Navigator Collapsible Sling 6L (not sure it will hold up to long term EDC use)\n- something from tomtoc or similar brand\n\nMaybe:\n- Peak Design Outdoor Sling 7L (not sure it fits ipad and looks quite big)\n- Topo Designs Quick pack 7.3L (not sure it fits iPad)\n- Alpaka metro crossbody 10L (more backpack-ish)\n- Osprey Daylite Sling 6L (more backpack-ish)\n- Patagonia Atom Sling 8L (backpackish and maybe too big)\n\nId love to have any insights from the community on the above packs and any recommendations for ones i haven’t considered yet. Thanks!",

The DS3 max is a very nice sling, and well worth the money. I’m glad I went with two different types (or sizes) of slings for everyday carry. \n\nTomtoc makes an excellent slimmer sling I tried that easily holds an iPad, similar to the DS3 max.

        "selftext": "Just got back from a week long trip with the “new” Patagonia black hole 25L and it was great. I’ve taken it on other trips but this was the first on a truly one bag trip and it worked great. Zero issues fitting it under the seats on a Ryanair 737 and also had enough space to stack my sling on top. \n\n\nPacking list:\n3 shirts-Patagonia responsibilitee long sleeve, Uniqlo airism short sleeve and another random Uniqlo shirt. \n2 pairs of trousers being the Patagonia Venga rock pants and Lululemon abc’s. \n1 pair of shorts:Patagonia strider pro shorts\n3 pairs of random underwear and 3 pairs of socks+ one extra of each worn on me whilst travelling. \n\nJackets: I brought my Patagonia nano puff, Arcteryx Beta LT and Lululemon sojourn windbreaker. The windbreaker was worn on me on the way there whilst the other two jackets were in the bag and on the way back the beta and nanopuff were worn. \n\nAside from that I brought my blunt umbrella which fit nicely in the bottle pocket, a headlamp and my tech pouch with chargers, adapters etc and also a 32oz Nalgene which fit nicely in the bottle pocket. Also picked up a copy of dune which was pretty thick and went into the laptop sleeve but didn’t cause any discomfort. \n\nI also managed to fit my Dji drone with the carrying case inside the bag with zero issues.\nSling was carried outside and has worked perfectly over the years. Overall there’s not really anything I’d change with the current setup and the black hole has taken everything I’ve thrown at it. Whether it’s daily use, travelling, hiking, climbing etc it’s worked perfectly. \n\nI’m happy to answer any questions/concerns/comments anyone might have. ",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: pulled the trigger on the Aer Gym Duffel 3 with the Travel Kit toiletry bag. \n\nMy only concern is the small 24L but watching the very few youtube reviews out there, it seems it might work for what i need it for. \n\nWill update on the quality of the bag when i receive it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nello!\n\nNeed your help on choosing the perfect weekend getaway duffel to pair with my new Aer Daypack 2 backpack. (which I absolutely LOVE). My tech and gear will stay in the Daypack. Shoes + clothes + CPAP machine will live in the duffel. I've narrowed down my choices to the following 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; trying to match with my Aer Daypack 2 which is why I'm trying to stick to Aer products, but it's not an absolute must. Shoe compartments are a plus, laptop compartments a plus. Would love it if anyone has real-world experiences with either bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) [Aer Gym Duffel 3](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-3-black) **$169** \\---- 24.1L (17\" x 11.5\" x 9\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9l2y1vj6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc79be145ebf631f8a1bb2acca6801bca4e1076d\n\nThis one seems like the newest out of the families of Aer duffels, but also the smallest coming in at 24L. The shoe compartment is a big seller for me since I love that feature and prevents me from buying a shoe bag. I also like to keep my dirty clothes in there after the trip.\n\n* *Pros*: Matches with backpack, newer materials and improvements from the Duffel 2 (i think?), shoe compartment, brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons: S*maller than the others, more expensive. only one review on youtube from RushFaster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) [Aer Gym Duffel 2](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-2-black) **$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhlbprkk6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4f99188cdcb3986828a7d4f180d9c5356b2122\n\n**$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nI believe this is the version before the Gym Duffel 3, but some reason the size is way bigger.\n\n* *Pros:* shoe compartment, larger in size,brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons:* older? maybe doesnt have some improvements in materials like the newer Duffel 3? Also another con is the zipper down the center, seems awkward. couldnt find any reviews online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.)  [Aer Travel Duffel](https://www.aersf.com/travel-duffel-black) **$170** \\---- **35L** (21.3\" x 12.6\" x 9.1\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewyvwm7l6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e05290a837652c94f80846ff83269b68f0a6406\n\nThis is the one specifically for traveling with a huge bucket-style opening to dump clothes in. Although this one is considered the \"travel\" one, it don't like that it doesn't have the shoe compartment at least.\n\n* Pros: big bucket-style opening, nice handle, compression straps, brand uniformity with aer\n* Cons: no shoe compartment, the center-placed handle doesn't seem like it might handle a lot of weight if carried briefcase-style. few reviews online but everyone says it's decent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[removed peak design 35L since feedback has been so-so\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love and appreciate your input!",

Your post does both and more, so thank you!\n\nPersonally, I'd go with the one that looks best with your Daypack and for me, that's the [Aer Travel Duffel](https://www.aersf.com/travel-duffel-black) \\- hands down.\n\nThe Gym Duffels look (as intended) like gym duffels. For travel, I think you want a more put-together look.\n\nRegarding the built-in shoe compartment: having a separate bag for your shoes is functionally the same (keeps the dirt off your clothes), looks cleaner (fewer external zippers), and is more versatile because you can leave it at home if you don't need an extra pair of shoes for your trip.\n\nThere are tons of high-quality, lightweight options for shoe bags too. I have one of these [Killspencer shoe bags, made of parachute material](https://killspencer.com/collections/bags/products/parachute-bag-2-0-shoe-bag?variant=18745161318462).\n\nAs for the Peak bag, I'm just not into the design, but if you're open to other brands, I love  /u/duncanjewett's suggestion for the [Bellroy Weekender](https://bellroy.com/products/weekender/baida_nylon/marine_blue#slide-0). I'm a huge fan of internal water bottle pockets, which that bag has, and the construction and features are all on point. It also comes in a larger size, called the [Weekender Plus](https://bellroy.com/products/weekender-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-0).\n\nLet us know what you decide!",

There is no dedicated shoe compartment because PD makes a Shoe Pouch, is my guess. \n\nIf I had any criticism of it, it would be the carry handles. The magnets are a novel concept, but IRL they aren't strong enough to hold the handles together except under ideal circumstances. As a result, you've now got two magnetic strips as handles - they're narrow and not at all comfortable to carry through an airport or something. I eventually took mine off, and only use the shoulder strap (which is awesome) or the grab handles on the ends to carry it vertically. I guess you could also get something to wrap the carry handles (like a [Mr. Gripper](https://defybags.com/collections/accessories-1/products/mr-gripper-horween-cavalier-whiskey-leather), for example) and that would also solve that issue.\n\nEverything else I've enjoyed, these are good bags for the money. You can sometimes find refurbished travel duffels on the PD eBay store - they come with the same warranty as the new bags, and you can save some money.",

I’m not particularly impressed with companies that are making duffles based off of soft sided toolbags or the old doctor’s bag with wide gatemouth opening.  35L is also going to be too small for my needs. \n\nI appreciate EG’s efforts to make a technical duffle but this doesn’t do it for me.",

My use case would be car travel and business travel by air. For business travel, I have to take a pair or two of dress shoes that I’ve put a lot of time and energy into shining properly and I refuse to check those so I always end up traveling with backpack, duffel, and carry-on suitcase that I check. Clothes in the carry-on, shoes in the duffel, work tech in the backpack. \n\nI have the Peak Design travel duffel 35L, and hate it. The carry handles are horrendous; the magnets don’t work at all, either to snap the carry handles together or to snap the bag’s sides down as advertised; and the bag itself has no real structure and sags down in the middle at the bottom like every other trash duffel I’ve had. The exterior pockets are fine, but not revolutionary. The only thing it does well is look really good. \n\nI’m not as triggered to immediately buy the EG TD35 as I’ve been to buy their CPLs, CTB26, and CAPs, but I’m leaning towards giving it the ol’ college try. I think with packing cubes, it’ll load beautifully and do exactly what I need it to do, but do it better than any other duffel I’ve tried. \n\nI do wish they’d given us the option to either load a laptop or use that panel as a luggage pass-through. A simple extra panel of 840D fabric on that exterior side would’ve given us the choice.",

Mainly why you choose it over any other backpack, roller for travel, ect. \n\nI’m a healthcare worker that flys once a week and I’m usually carrying a bunch of medical supplies and expensive medications. I see patients some times in rural areas. These are day trips on short flights. \n\nI’m thinking in my head of having a duffel as a carryon but I really dislike the backpack straps that I’ve seen on a lot of the modern duffels like the Patagonia Black Hole. I won’t be doing any long distant walks by any means with the bag at all. A robust kind of roller seems ok also but the wheels might get slightly beat up. \n\nThanks in advance. \n\n(Pictures: Wanded Carryall Duffel)",

I don’t think it was less volume in the end though.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpr6bsylwrtc1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e46bf0f569b1e51c5a50f36588b27477bba36d16\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Aer Travel Pack 3](https://aersf.com/products/travel-pack-3): [https://imgur.com/a/mmsUIyL](https://imgur.com/a/mmsUIyL)\n\nThe TP3 continues to be one of my favorite bags to pack.  The secondary (admin) compartment is huge and gives me plenty of options to organize.  If I wasn't doing a head-to-head comparison, I might use less pouches and use more of the built-in organization.  I had some space available, but not much.  That space in the admin panel couldn't easily be used and still close the pack.  However, there is definitely some space still available and room for optimization (i.e. I realized in later packs/bags I should've been squishing the shoes with the packing cubes not just letting the zipper do all the work).\n\n[Evergoods CTB35](https://evergoods.us/collections/the-travel-shop/products/civic-travel-bag-35l): [https://imgur.com/a/otlUY8s](https://imgur.com/a/otlUY8s)\n\nI had to pack this a few different ways (and I've learned more about how to pack since then, so maybe I could do better now) to make it all fit &amp; close.  That said, the bag handled everything well.  Here's an important note for this bag, more than many others: use all the gusseted areas!  I tried to fit everything in the main compartment but it didn't necessarily stretch into and use the front panel's dedicated volume.  I did like how I still had room in the yoke pocket after everything was loaded up.  Would've been even better if the front dump pocket was still usable, too.  There's no great quick access spot for the AirPods Max though.\n\n[Matador Globerider45](https://www.matadorequipment.com/products/globerider45-travel-backpack): [https://imgur.com/a/3emMaIM](https://imgur.com/a/3emMaIM)\n\nI took this backpack for the trip. I really like the way everything fit and left me room to either squeeze the bag into a bin if needed and/or have room for spontaneous purchases (which is likely to happen on vacation).  The primary bucket is nice and deep, letting me squish all my shoes and have my packing cubes on top without eating space of the secondary compartments.  I also feel like the overall length (height when carried) gives plenty of options.  I really like the stretchy mesh on the outside which gives me room for last minute things or random items as well e.g. I was able to fit my headphones, or jacket, or flip flops in there.\n\n[Osprey Fairview 40L](https://www.osprey.com/fairview-40-travel-pack-fairvew40f22-550#color=Night%2520Jungle%2520Blue): [https://imgur.com/a/qYLaIv7](https://imgur.com/a/qYLaIv7)\n\nOne of my wife's bags but since it's in the same size range, I figured I would pack it out, too.  I actually got this at a ridiculous (incorrectly marked) discount.  I wasn't hunting for this bag but I don't hate it at all.  The tub is quite deep but the lack of any outside pockets made it not quite ideal for our trip.  Well, that and my wife kept adding stuff to her pack and decided she didn't want to carry 25lbs LOL.\n\n[Pakt One Travel Backpack 45L](https://paktbags.com/products/the-pakt-travel-backpack?variant=44241715331310): [https://imgur.com/a/H2tfJmi](https://imgur.com/a/H2tfJmi)\n\nI actually really really love the way this, and the duffel, pack!  However, if you do overpack, especially the side with the laptop, closing this can be very challenging.  The Aer packing cubes I'm using were too big (tall) for the bag and it took some time to close the flaps and fit the laptop in.  However, I didn't have to expand the bag to fit everything in, which still gives me the option to fit the 15L Everyday bag in if I want.  Another thing I appreciate is the top access to the packing areas.  Once everything was closed up, I was able to open the top access and shove more small items in.  \n\n[Pakt Bags Travel Duffel 35L](https://paktbags.com/products/pakt-one-travel-duffel?variant=44368078962926): [https://imgur.com/a/dVXmvak](https://imgur.com/a/dVXmvak)\n\nAs I said earlier, I love the way this packs, but I overwhelm either side with my Aer packing cubes.  I think either of these would be better off without packing cubes for clothes.  I really like the outboard pockets on the duffel - these are awesome quick access pockets.  Also of note is the 16\" MacBook Pro didn't completely fit loading it top down.  I needed to use the top flap of the zipper to cover it completely, which was impossible to do once the bag was closed when packed out like I had it.\n\n[Tom Bihn Techonaut 45](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/travel-bags/products/techonaut-45): [https://imgur.com/a/GemarrF](https://imgur.com/a/GemarrF)\n\nI think I packed this poorly and really couldn't get it to carry the way I wanted.  However, I was able to get everything in using the secondary compartment.  IMO this is the biggest disappointment in the group.  It's 45L but the arrangement is just not great.  I could open up the zipper to create one large bucket but I shouldn't have to.  Also, because all the outer pockets take space from the main compartment, it's just not ideal for any quick access needs e.g. headphones, tablet, etc.  FWIW, when I use the secondary compartment for shoes, the bag won't self-stand, which I find annoying.\n\n[Tortuga Travel Backpack 40](https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/travel-backpack-40l): [https://imgur.com/a/ppJ6A9j](https://imgur.com/a/ppJ6A9j)\n\nMuch like the Aer TP3, the Tortuga's secondary (admin) compartment is huge and gives me lots of organization options.  I could've fit one more pouch in there.  In retrospect, I should've packed this very differently, but it worked without much effort, which is always nice.  I continue to love the Tortuga and will probably use this for work trips with a daypack in there.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions about these bags or my experiences!",

I kinda hate the way it packs - it feels backwards to me.  \n\nTo answer your question, that’s a hard toss up. If I could get everything in to 35L I would probably go with the Aer but I don’t like their hip belt so I’d use something different there. The nice thing with the Aer is you can compress it and use it as  a very large heavy daypack LOL. \n\nThe Tortuga is the sweet spot IMO.  And you can fit in a packable bag for a daypack too.  See my previous post (linked above) about how much you can really pack in the Tortuga. It stretches really well and all the compartments have good volume.\n\nWhile I’m learning to onebag I’m still kinda overpacking so I’d probably still go bigger than smaller LOL.",

            "body": "Fascinating experiment and thanks for sharing. I tested 4 of these bags (Aer TP3, Osprey Fairview 40, Techonaut 30, Tortuga 30) and my findings were completely different! Travel backpacks are truly a YMMV proposition. Note: I’m a 5’4” woman with slight shoulders. My rankings:\n\n1. Techonaut 30 - It fit everything I wanted to carry with room to spare and was very comfortable to carry. I love the bottom, separated compartment. I will be using this for an upcoming 2-week trip. \n\n\n2. Tortuga 30 - I found the built-in organization made it harder for my things to fit. But I’m a big fan of pouches and cubes so internal organization isn’t as important for me. It was also less comfortable to carry than the Techonaut. I thought this would be the bag I chose, but Tom Bihn beat it out easily. \n\n\n3. Osprey Fairview 40 - Great bag. Very comfortable. Very affordable. But it was too big and didn’t have quite enough external or internal organization. It’s a delicate balance, honestly. My wife loved the bag and chose it for travel. \n\n\n4. Aer TP3 - The one I wanted for aesthetic reasons but… Similar complaints with the Tortuga but even more organization options that would likely go to waste for me and, thus, not able to use it optimally. I also thought this was the least comfortable carry for my frame.",

                "body": "Thank you for sharing!  Yeah, the more I think about it, and use the bags, the more I realize I like the \\_idea\\_ of organization, but I don't use it very much.  I use a lot of pouches.  But I do like quick access.  So having the compartments (e.g. Tortuga and TP3 admin panel) with good stuff space helps me put my pouches somewhere I can access them instead of being buried in big bucket.  \n\nI did have challenges with the GR3 and Fairview (and, to a degree, the PD Travel and CTB35) packing well because I only have a couple cubes and then several pouches, packable backpack, duffel bag, jacket, etc., that don't stack well.  So I liked having places they could go and I could access them.\n\nI did use the Techonaut 45 on a previous trip.  I do \\_not\\_ dislike the bag.  Everytime I think about selling it, I stop.  I love the look of the bag and have convinced myself I haven't learned how to pack it right yet.  In fact, last night I ordered the packing cubes for it.  However, I really wish the pockets did not intrude on the main compartment space.  It really does have to be packed like a 35 for the pockets to be usable.\n\nI don't think I should be surprised that the Fairview was most comfortable for you (F), right?  I'll be honest, until the Fairview I didn't know there were packs made just for women, but now that I know I would find more like that for my wife, too.\n\nLet me know how your trip goes and how the Techonaut fares!",

Did your arms feel constricted? Having freedom of movement AND having all of the stuff I need to take with me is important to me. In particular, how did the Pakt, Matador, and Tortuga packs feel?

                "body": "Yeah, I realized later I should've talked about carry comfort.  It's been a few weeks since I wrote this up, so we'll see what I remember.  Luckily, I did do a trip with the Matador and the Tortuga recently, too.  I'm 5'9\"-ish, 200lbs.  To answer your question:\n\n  \n- The Tortuga is as comfortable as the reviews say.  Love the shoulder strap padding, the hip belts are very effective, and (pretty packed out) it doesn't feel too huge.  I did not feel constricted at all (other than the fact that I have a turtle shell on my back). My arms were free and comfortable.  \n- The Matador Globerider45 also feels good.  The padding all works well including the padded hip belt.  The big difference is the height (length?) of the bag.  It was not uncomfortable for me, but it was not as comfortable as the Tortuga.  My head was not hitting the top of the bag or anything, but I could definitely tell it was bigger.  It was not really constricting my movement, but I did use the Tortuga right after and felt that was slightly more comfortable.  To be fair, this also feels like more than 45 and is more packed out.  \n- Pakt Travel Backpack 2.0 is OK.  The hip belt is just a strap, but you could change that out for a more padded belt.  The shoulder straps are a little stiff.  The Packhacker review felt it was uncomfortable, I thought it was OK.  It was not constrictive by any means, but the comfortable shoulder straps of the Tortuga (and Tom Bihn) have me spoiled.  I definitely feel the stiffness of the fabric on the Pakt.  I also haven't broken this in at all, so it may not be a fair assessment.  \n- The Aer TP3 is always comfortable.  Great shoulder straps, hip belt is not as great as Tortuga or Matador but it is padded and works well enough.  My niece (who has now taken the TP3) put it on and was dancing around.  She thought it was magical the way all the weight was gone.\n\nHope that helps!",
