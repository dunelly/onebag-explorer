        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go.

I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe.

I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it.

Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "selftext": "Well, I'll just say it before anyone gets a chance too, haha. We still have a lot of stuff. There's room to improve for sure. But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

        "selftext": "Well, I'll just say it before anyone gets a chance too, haha. We still have a lot of stuff. There's room to improve for sure. But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

I also could have done with only 1 pair of sandals, and originally only had the very flat Xero barefoot sandals, which are great and comfy but don't slip on quickly and can't wear with socks because of the toe loop. I had some room left and had recently bought the cheap Target slip on sandals and really liked that I could still wear them with socks on and just quick access in general. And the pullover hoodie is probably not needed, but I wanted it (if you're a Survivor fan, it's one of my \"luxury items\" lol)",

But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

        "selftext": "Well, I'll just say it before anyone gets a chance too, haha. We still have a lot of stuff. There's room to improve for sure. But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

I also could have done with only 1 pair of sandals, and originally only had the very flat Xero barefoot sandals, which are great and comfy but don't slip on quickly and can't wear with socks because of the toe loop. I had some room left and had recently bought the cheap Target slip on sandals and really liked that I could still wear them with socks on and just quick access in general. And the pullover hoodie is probably not needed, but I wanted it (if you're a Survivor fan, it's one of my \"luxury items\" lol)",

I also could have done with only 1 pair of sandals, and originally only had the very flat Xero barefoot sandals, which are great and comfy but don't slip on quickly and can't wear with socks because of the toe loop. I had some room left and had recently bought the cheap Target slip on sandals and really liked that I could still wear them with socks on and just quick access in general. And the pullover hoodie is probably not needed, but I wanted it (if you're a Survivor fan, it's one of my \"luxury items\" lol)",

Plus a travel hairdryer, and my medicine bag annoyingly taking up a lot of space but nothing I can do about that 🙄 Actually ended up with even more medicine after a nasty fall down a volcano (no broken bones thankfully, but bad open wound cuts and bruises). \n\nI had less shirts, only 2 long sleeve hiking shirts, 2 tank tops, 1 tshirt. The tank tops and tshirt are long gone, have been replacing them from Mega Pacas. \n\nI also packed a thick hoodie/fleece I got from Ecuador, AMAZING for keeping warm on the volcanoes! Not so great for night breezes in warmer places. I bought a lighter weight one in Guatemala for that. Also have a winter hat with ear flaps and gloves, cuz I struggled to find any at home that fit so once I found them I BRING them. And a fall coat, which I wear over the thick Ecuador hoodie. It's LL Bean and doubles as a rain jacket in warmer climates, and with many pockets!\n\nOh also a travel heating pad, which is one of my BEST packing decisions! On shorter trips, I always missed it but was home to use it again in a few weeks. For many months, that lil thing is a miracle worker! Love being able to relax my muscles right away 🙂 \n\n3 months in was when I gave up on one-bagging. I carry food from hostel to hostel, plus that extra hoodie. And I'm now in warmer weather areas, so my winter stuff is just sitting on the bottom of my bag (it's good quality and FITS me, so I'm not willing to leave those behind cuz I struggle enough to find clothes that fit nvm good quality) for a while. Also picked up some notebooks from my Spanish lessons that I still study from.\n\nI think maybe if I stop cooking my own food and don't carry snacks, then I could one bag again, but I'm not a fan of a grumbly tummy. It's not so bad having my big pack plus my daypack as a carryon on the chicken busses. I didn't expect to have a need for so much more stuff when I started out!",

Trust me that metal water bottle swinging around gets annoying real quick, let's just say I had never been more delighted to 'lose' something within the first few weeks of traveling. Also might be worth bringing extra small bags such as packing cubes and pack them into your daypack. I found that when I was based in a particular city, I would travel to nearby cities for a few days, but would completely survive off a day pack while my bigger bag was securely locked in a hostel in the bigger city but also you have 3-4 days worth of clothes in your daypack so you don't need to keep accessing your bigger bag. The only flaw with this bag, is the laptop sleeve compartment in the front, whatever you do, dont put any electronics there. My backup phone snapped in half lol. Have fun!",

Also might be worth bringing extra small bags such as packing cubes and pack them into your daypack. I found that when I was based in a particular city, I would travel to nearby cities for a few days, but would completely survive off a day pack while my bigger bag was securely locked in a hostel in the bigger city but also you have 3-4 days worth of clothes in your daypack so you don't need to keep accessing your bigger bag. The only flaw with this bag, is the laptop sleeve compartment in the front, whatever you do, dont put any electronics there. My backup phone snapped in half lol. Have fun!",

The tank tops and tshirt are long gone, have been replacing them from Mega Pacas. \n\nI also packed a thick hoodie/fleece I got from Ecuador, AMAZING for keeping warm on the volcanoes! Not so great for night breezes in warmer places. I bought a lighter weight one in Guatemala for that. Also have a winter hat with ear flaps and gloves, cuz I struggled to find any at home that fit so once I found them I BRING them. And a fall coat, which I wear over the thick Ecuador hoodie. It's LL Bean and doubles as a rain jacket in warmer climates, and with many pockets!\n\nOh also a travel heating pad, which is one of my BEST packing decisions! On shorter trips, I always missed it but was home to use it again in a few weeks. For many months, that lil thing is a miracle worker! Love being able to relax my muscles right away 🙂 \n\n3 months in was when I gave up on one-bagging. I carry food from hostel to hostel, plus that extra hoodie. And I'm now in warmer weather areas, so my winter stuff is just sitting on the bottom of my bag (it's good quality and FITS me, so I'm not willing to leave those behind cuz I struggle enough to find clothes that fit nvm good quality) for a while. Also picked up some notebooks from my Spanish lessons that I still study from.\n\nI think maybe if I stop cooking my own food and don't carry snacks, then I could one bag again, but I'm not a fan of a grumbly tummy.

Trust me that metal water bottle swinging around gets annoying real quick, let's just say I had never been more delighted to 'lose' something within the first few weeks of traveling. Also might be worth bringing extra small bags such as packing cubes and pack them into your daypack. I found that when I was based in a particular city, I would travel to nearby cities for a few days, but would completely survive off a day pack while my bigger bag was securely locked in a hostel in the bigger city but also you have 3-4 days worth of clothes in your daypack so you don't need to keep accessing your bigger bag. The only flaw with this bag, is the laptop sleeve compartment in the front, whatever you do, dont put any electronics there. My backup phone snapped in half lol. Have fun!",

Plus a travel hairdryer, and my medicine bag annoyingly taking up a lot of space but nothing I can do about that 🙄 Actually ended up with even more medicine after a nasty fall down a volcano (no broken bones thankfully, but bad open wound cuts and bruises). \n\nI had less shirts, only 2 long sleeve hiking shirts, 2 tank tops, 1 tshirt. The tank tops and tshirt are long gone, have been replacing them from Mega Pacas. \n\nI also packed a thick hoodie/fleece I got from Ecuador, AMAZING for keeping warm on the volcanoes! Not so great for night breezes in warmer places. I bought a lighter weight one in Guatemala for that. Also have a winter hat with ear flaps and gloves, cuz I struggled to find any at home that fit so once I found them I BRING them. And a fall coat, which I wear over the thick Ecuador hoodie. It's LL Bean and doubles as a rain jacket in warmer climates, and with many pockets!\n\nOh also a travel heating pad, which is one of my BEST packing decisions! On shorter trips, I always missed it but was home to use it again in a few weeks. For many months, that lil thing is a miracle worker! Love being able to relax my muscles right away 🙂 \n\n3 months in was when I gave up on one-bagging. I carry food from hostel to hostel, plus that extra hoodie. And I'm now in warmer weather areas, so my winter stuff is just sitting on the bottom of my bag (it's good quality and FITS me, so I'm not willing to leave those behind cuz I struggle enough to find clothes that fit nvm good quality) for a while. Also picked up some notebooks from my Spanish lessons that I still study from.\n\nI think maybe if I stop cooking my own food and don't carry snacks, then I could one bag again, but I'm not a fan of a grumbly tummy. It's not so bad having my big pack plus my daypack as a carryon on the chicken busses. I didn't expect to have a need for so much more stuff when I started out!",

Thank you! :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took the foam out of my cabeau travel pillow case and rolled my clothes in a way that mimics the shape of the pillow. It fits ALL of my packed clothes except the pants and hat, which are rolled in the bottom of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes about the clothes I'll be wearing: I'm coming from a cold place, hence the puffer, scarf and mitts...and when we go to the Huasteca area it will be chilly during the night. So I have two merino layers plus a cotton sweater and long johns for those evenings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bag: Dakine Split Adventure 28L. I feel like it packs smaller than 28L but I am usually traveling with 16L so it doesn't bother me. I feel like there's still a lot of room, even after my bulky sunglasses case, toiletry bag and other travel \"ingredients\" like phone, charging brick, laundry strips etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take the pillow out during the flight to use and then put it back in afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a \"plain\" person; buzz cut, no makeup, don't shave body hair, don't wear a bra, run very cold even in warm areas, autistic and prefer to look / feel the same all the time hence the duplicates/similar style of clothes. I could probably get away with only bringing the one pair of hiking pants but since it will be a \"colder\" Mexico trip I don't feel comfortable doing that. Temperatures will range from an average of 5 degrees celcuis in the mornings to 20 degrees celcuis in the afternoons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSolo trip to see my friend. We will be hiking the waterfall area of Huasteca Potosi, going to Real de Catorse, Sierra de Alvarez, Media Luna lake swimming, and hanging out in the city of SLP for a few days with my friend's family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't have a scale but it feels like it's around 11 pounds / 5kg.",

With experimenting, I found no irritation with optive fusion, instead with different brands of saline. So now I use single use saline packs for filling and larger bottles for rinsing. My ophthalmologist has okayed optive fusion for me. \n\nRegarding lens case, I use either clearcare or menicare plus depending on where I am and what I can find. I travel a lot so finding one can become a challenge in the countries I go to. As such, if I was using clear care at that time, I have a travel sized clearcare somewhere in my possession. However this ads to my carrying bulk so I prefer a flat lens case pre-filled with menicare plus that takes the place of the clearcare case in this picture. In the off-chance that I’m out with a clearcare case and no solution, I just fill it with saline and go home to do a proper rinse. \n\nI hope that answers both your questions.",

I've been one-bagging out of a 22L bag I've had since high school and got to looking for a new bag after a recent international trip. ~~Spain was rough on it~~ Me in Spain was rough on it, but it's been with me daily for almost eight years now. In person I actually like the BH's finish...it's different and it's own vibe, especially in this navy/orange color pair 😘\n\nI've been searching for a bag that would triple for EDC, hiking, and minimal one-bagging. I wanted an Ultra Dragonfly, but I just can't afford it right now. The REI Rucksack 28 seemed like a good fit (especially when on sale), but after trying it I didn't like how it wore and the side pocket things.\n\nI was planning on waiting out for Black Friday to maybe grab a Mystery Ranch Catalyst 26 or the new Patagonia Black Hole 25L, but with retailers clearing out stock of the previous model of the BH, I thought I'd try it out. I'll test pack it with my packing list from Spain over the weekend, but I've clocked some miles today with it and I'm pretty happy with it.\n\nI'm 6'5\", so the height of the bag works well for me, and I love the slim profile. I'm concerned it's tall for flight travel, but I'm willing to risk it or just plan on using an old bag if I'm flying on a strict airline.\n\nHoping this is going to be a win for me 🤞 I previously invested in some ~~top notch~~ Amazon Basics packing cubes to help when traveling—though if you've got experience with this bag I'm open to packing cube suggestions!",

Seems to me having the Xs MAX kinda eats into the territory the iPad is meant to fill. \n\nAlso consider getting USB C chargers for your devices and you can shave off that 12W charger and just run with the larger one. Even if you don’t get the cords you can use your MBP as a charging station and plug your devices into it (this is possible with USB charging).\n\nIf you’re looking for a noise cancelling headphone I’ve heard a lot of people had success with the Bose earbuds. I use the QC35s myself and I find them worth the weight and bulk even if I only use them during flights. \n\nCutting down weight some more - do you need the 2TB backup drive? Have you considered setting up a home server so you can access your personal files away from home? Or just use a secure cloud storage.

I wouldn’t mind a 135mm, but I don’t find it totally necessary. I figured it would be a good idea to bring my AE-1 for a body back-up, and mju II for light carry (I’ll be attending a wedding, plus built-in flash).\n\nMy hang up is I have a Canon Elan 50E/Rebel 2000 duo that I was originally planning to use for this trip. \nTheir plus side: I bought a couple EF lenses with two focal lengths I’d prefer (35mm f2, 85mm f1.8), and having some modern features is convenient (AF, detailed/reliable metering, built-in flash)\nTheir downside: the bodies are bulky as hell with battery grips (although easy to not use), and the lenses I got both have some usability issues. The 35mm AF/MF switch *fell off*, so it’s covered with electrical tape, and the 85mm has a broken AF stutter past 5ft (manual works). \n\nI feel like less is more here with travel, and this is might be overkill.

I don't own many clothes and typically wear the same outfits at home so the lack of outfits was not a concern to me. I will have one nice outfit for any occasion and all of the hotels I am staying at will provide pajamas and laundry facilities. I will wash underwear when I shower and have a spare pair to easily rotate. When I need to wash any of my other clothes, I can in the sink at night, or use the laundry facilities in the hotel and wear the pajamas. The Daylite Sling will be a perfect day pack for exploring Japan as well. Enough room for some snacks, water, wallet, charger, rain coat, etc. I will also have a packable tote with me in case I need to carry anything else. I usually keep souvenirs pretty light on trips, but if there is something I really want to bring home, I can always just use the tote bag as my carry on, or pick up a duffle to bring as a carry on.

One pair of athletic shorts can work for swimming, exercise, and casual wear (I use a pair of Patagonia running shorts for all these things). If you make sure to use quick drying materials, then 4 shirts (t shirt, undershirt (heattech), short sleeve/polo, long sleeve button down) would usually be perfectly sufficient. You may find that a long sleeve button down is a good staple shirt even in the warmer climate of Southern Asia because of mosquitoes in the evening, and maybe sun protection during the day (if you burn easily).\n\nI usually bring a long sleeved rash vest when I’m planning to go swimming in the tropics, which doubles as a hiking shirt or running top. YMMV.",

It fits sideways luckily because both flights on American today had smaller-than-I-remember space under the seat. I really think maybe 25 liters would be max, it was kinda a tight fit with the 19 liters and you’d be in real trouble if you needed to place it vertically. There was no room for me to put it under top first, stuck way out into the footwell area.",
