I attached some 1\" webbing so I can hook more pouches into it for a mouse, numpad, game emulator, etc.\n\nThe inside is lined with something like neoprene, and I sandwiched some 1/8\" EVA foam between the outside and inside cloth on all sides.\n\nI'm very pleased with the stability of the addition when it's strapped to my Chrome bag. I was worried it might bounce or sway, but the locking D-clips I used on the sides keep it mounted really tightly.\n\nI made this in a 12-hour scramble before flying, so the insides are not seam-taped with Grosgrain like I would usually do, but it'll hold for now.",

The plan is to fly into Rome, work our way north through Germany, then Amsterdam, and then fly to Norway for the last few days.\n\nOff the bat, I will say that I’m bringing a LOT more than is necessary, like 6 shirts, 3 pants, and 4 pairs of shoes.  I did this because I wanted an everyday sneaker (canvas Converse), and dressier shoe for nice dinners, sandals for warm weather and hotel room, and running shoes because I usually run 4-6 days a week and I’d like to continue to do so.  I’m not much of a souvenir guy, but I know the girlfriend and I will take lots of pics and I’d like to have several outfits.  Silly, but they don’t weigh much or take up much space so it’s not a big deal to me.\n\nI was torn between the Osprey Farpoint 40L, the Kuhl Eskape 25 (which really feels more like a 35), and the Hill People Gear Aston 3.  I think the Farpoint is best suited for the job, but it’s such a specialist bag that I don’t think I’d ever use it again.  I already own the Kuhl Eskape and it make a great weekend bag, but I don’t care for the organization and it’s not terribly comfy for heavier loads.  I decided on the HPG Aston 3 because of its size, comfortable harness system, and the fact that it makes a fantastic day bag for hiking, so I’ll continue using it for the foreseeable future.\n\nEverything fits well in the Aston 3.  There’re also lots of tie downs, so I can strap additional stuff to it if needed.  This is important because I know I’ll end up carrying some of the GF’s stuff.  Were it not for the pair of running shoes, I’d have plenty of space, but the addition of them makes things a bit tight, though perfectly mageable.  HPG make a waist belt for it that I’m considering, but the harness is so comfortable, I’m just not sure I need it.  I plan on using the Stowaway as my personal item on plane/train rides, as well as carry the GF’s stuff.\n\nThe only thing I’m iffy on is my laptop.  It’s a Surface Pro Studio 2, and on the heavy side.  I may swap it out for an old Surface Pro 7 that is about 25% of the weight.

            "body": "Hello Reddit!  I’m prepping for my 1st onebag trip and I wanted to share my planned loadout.  The plan is to fly into Rome, work our way north through Germany, then Amsterdam, and then fly to Norway for the last few days.\n\nOff the bat, I will say that I’m bringing a LOT more than is necessary, like 6 shirts, 3 pants, and 4 pairs of shoes.  I did this because I wanted an everyday sneaker (canvas Converse), and dressier shoe for nice dinners, sandals for warm weather and hotel room, and running shoes because I usually run 4-6 days a week and I’d like to continue to do so.  I’m not much of a souvenir guy, but I know the girlfriend and I will take lots of pics and I’d like to have several outfits.  Silly, but they don’t weigh much or take up much space so it’s not a big deal to me.\n\nI was torn between the Osprey Farpoint 40L, the Kuhl Eskape 25 (which really feels more like a 35), and the Hill People Gear Aston 3.  I think the Farpoint is best suited for the job, but it’s such a specialist bag that I don’t think I’d ever use it again.  I already own the Kuhl Eskape and it make a great weekend bag, but I don’t care for the organization and it’s not terribly comfy for heavier loads.  I decided on the HPG Aston 3 because of its size, comfortable harness system, and the fact that it makes a fantastic day bag for hiking, so I’ll continue using it for the foreseeable future.\n\nEverything fits well in the Aston 3.  There’re also lots of tie downs, so I can strap additional stuff to it if needed.  This is important because I know I’ll end up carrying some of the GF’s stuff.  Were it not for the pair of running shoes, I’d have plenty of space, but the addition of them makes things a bit tight, though perfectly mageable.  HPG make a waist belt for it that I’m considering, but the harness is so comfortable, I’m just not sure I need it.  I plan on using the Stowaway as my personal item on plane/train rides, as well as carry the GF’s stuff.\n\nThe only thing I’m iffy on is my laptop.  It’s a Surface Pro Studio 2, and on the heavy side.  I may swap it out for an old Surface Pro 7 that is about 25% of the weight.  I would also leave the Bluetooth controller home, then.\n\nTotal Weight w/ empty water bottle 29.3 pounds\n\n•\tMain Pack = Hill People Gear Aston 3 \n\n•\tDopp Kit = Chrome Urban Ex Travel Kit *Discontinued* \n\n•\tTech Pouch = Chrome Industries Large Utility Pouch \n\n•\tDay Pack = Eddie Bauer 20L Stowaway Backpack \n\n•\tVelcro Laptop Sleeve = North St Hook &amp; Loop Laptop Sleeve (it attaches inside the back panel of the Aston 3) \n\n•\tPacking Cube =  Knack Expanding Packing Cube + some no-name cube \n\n•\tShow Bag = Knack Large Compressible Shoe Bag",

Straps have a really nice s-curve and are very comfortable. It sits very well on a smaller frame (5ft6\" F).\n\nIt's lovely if you want the small size or waterproofing, but if those aren't key considerations it might not be what you need.

However, I tend not to go for boxy bags in general unless they're travel bags — in which case, I DO want a boxy bag so my packing cubes and organizer pouches fit optimally.\n\nAlso, it is nice that you can remove the straps on the bag with the \"T-lok\" and place them in a different position to accommodate narrow and wide shoulders. But for me, idk if I would use that feature on an 18L bag. Maybe if the bag were a hiking bag and I were carrying a heavy load, but 18L is so small that idk if many people really need that feature.",
