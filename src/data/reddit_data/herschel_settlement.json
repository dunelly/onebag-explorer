I lost an item that holds great sentimental value to me.\n\nItem description: black/gray Herschel Supply Co. pencil pouch, image attached. It contains a family heirloom inside that I can’t live without. It also contains a university ID with my name on it. \n\nMy flight was this past Wednesday, January 29. My best guess is that I left the item on the tables at the D gates outside of the food area (Starbucks, Red Mango, Chili’s) near the D32-D43 gates. \n\nI already filed a report with the airport Lost and Found service and called them, but no luck yet. I also filed a report with Delta, just to be safe. \n\nAgain, any assistance is appreciated. Thank you all in advance!",
