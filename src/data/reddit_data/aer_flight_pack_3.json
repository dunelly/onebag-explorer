Couldn’t resist pulling the trigger at $120 on the Olive City Pack I’ve been eying. \n\nMany of you know that [I conflicted heavily between CPP and CP](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/WK9Em02uUl) last year. If I had to choose one, CPP was the right choice since I can use it as a personal item on flights and for my daily office use.  I always felt CP was better for daily carry though. \n\nNow I’m a true many bagger and own three expensive bags.  Rather than just posting pics of my new bag, I thought it’d be good to compare it to the PLC 20 as they are actually very similarly sized despite the differences in the listed Liters. I’d say CP is more like 18L in reality relatively vs. PLC’s 20L. Since you can carry the bottle on the outside with the CP, they can carry nearly identical amounts of EDC items.\n\nLove my new backpack. I only wish Aer made an Olive X-PAC version like Able Carry. I definitely wanted something not black though.\n\nEdit: [here’s a pic of both bags on me](https://imgur.com/a/6kfxqen).  I’m 5’7.\n\nEdit 2: [here’s back view comparison](https://imgur.com/a/1oXPc9t) since someone asked. I did one without water bottle for the CP to make the comparison fair. Keep in mind both bags actually look bigger in these pics since the bags were much closer to the camera than my body.  I wear size 40 Short for suits as a point of reference.",

For this the pack has been great. \n\nI’ve also planned to use it one bag travel with less tech, and clothes for a long weekend or week trip, which I did very successfully for a long weekend trip to Barcelona by train earlier this year. This current trip is at the upper end of what I would expect to be able to do with this bag so I was pretty impressed at how much clothing I could fit in with careful packing.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1bhtbr5/aer_nyc_store_review/",
        "selftext": "Picked up an Aer Travel Pack 3 Small (for my girl) and Day Sling 3 at the NYC Grand Opening this weekend. Here are a few thoughts.\n\nLocation: \n\nLocation was super easy to get to by subway. You can take the F/M to 2nd Ave or Lafayette/Broadway and just walk a block or two east or west depending on which you choose. The store is right at the top of soho so we had plenty of other shops to browse in after stopping at Aer.\n\nStore Layout:\n\nThe store is super small. Maybe like 300 square feet for the customer section with the bags. Bags are on platforms on the sides and back wall for customers to handle as they please. The reps encourage you to take the bag to a middle table/platform where there is more space to lay products down and examine. Selection was fine because it seemed like (nearly?) all product lines were out but if you wanted to see a specific material you had to ask and they’d get it from the back.\n\nCustomer Service: \n\nThis one I am kind of weary to review, as I only worked with one sales rep, but I would be remiss if I didn’t mention it. My sales rep seemed either very new or unknowledgeable. I would have to guess new because the rep was very nice and matched our energy, excited for the store opening, but did not have the product knowledge you would expect when buying expensive bags. \n\nThe rep did miss some more “level 2” questions asked like which material is heavier, which is alright. The rep didn’t know and looked it up. I knew but was kind of seeing what they are trained on at that point because previously the rep was missing a lot of basic stuff. For example not knowing how many litres/volume a bag is may be not expected for all products, again fine, but not knowing that an XPAC and nylon version of the same bag have the same volume is unexpected to me. I hung back for a lot and let my girlfriend ask her these questions because I didn’t want to jump in and answer when the sales rep was right there, but it seemed pretty odd that the rep had to look up almost everything. Had we worked with a manager I’m sure the thing would have been smoother. \n\nCheckout:\n\nCheckout process is easy. You get your item(s) in unbranded black paper shopping bags and get checked out on an iPhone with an NFC tap attachment. You can get email, Text, or paper receipts. We did get a little keychain for the grand opening, but I don’t think I’ll use it. The opening weekend offered 10% off but with NYC tax it’s basically just sticker price. In the past Aer didn’t charge me tax (TP3 purchase) so if I didn’t have the 10% off it would have actually cost MORE to shop in person. Hm? I was also slightly disappointed that they did not give any Aer holo stickers like I got when ordering online.\n\nOverall:\n\nOverall, glad that I have the store available to get hands on with things. It was a nice experience and I’m sure sales training and knowledge will improve over time for the presumably new employees. 7/10",

If I may, I will offer my own review of Aer’s new London (UK) store, which sounds very similar to the New York store.\nIt is located in Great Marlborough St, 5 mins walk from Oxford Circus in the most prestigious part of the West End. The store itself is small , probably about 8-900 square feet. It is sparsely furnished with shelving and a single table. All of the major products are on display, although it’s not obvious how they are organised. There’s a row of ‘Go’ items at the front, some ‘Pro’ items opposite and the Travel Packs and City Packs towards the rear of the store. There is one member of staff.\nI have bought three items from there over the past couple of months. Overall the staff are reasonably knowledgeable but the whole experience is so low key as to be unmemorable. Aers products are great, and they have a very premium, minimalist’vibe’. The store itself is so low key as to be almost forgettable It needs a bit more energy and the products need to be better showcased.",

        "selftext": "Picked up an Aer Travel Pack 3 Small (for my girl) and Day Sling 3 at the NYC Grand Opening this weekend. Here are a few thoughts.\n\nLocation: \n\nLocation was super easy to get to by subway. You can take the F/M to 2nd Ave or Lafayette/Broadway and just walk a block or two east or west depending on which you choose. The store is right at the top of soho so we had plenty of other shops to browse in after stopping at Aer.\n\nStore Layout:\n\nThe store is super small. Maybe like 300 square feet for the customer section with the bags. Bags are on platforms on the sides and back wall for customers to handle as they please. The reps encourage you to take the bag to a middle table/platform where there is more space to lay products down and examine. Selection was fine because it seemed like (nearly?) all product lines were out but if you wanted to see a specific material you had to ask and they’d get it from the back.\n\nCustomer Service: \n\nThis one I am kind of weary to review, as I only worked with one sales rep, but I would be remiss if I didn’t mention it. My sales rep seemed either very new or unknowledgeable. I would have to guess new because the rep was very nice and matched our energy, excited for the store opening, but did not have the product knowledge you would expect when buying expensive bags. \n\nThe rep did miss some more “level 2” questions asked like which material is heavier, which is alright. The rep didn’t know and looked it up. I knew but was kind of seeing what they are trained on at that point because previously the rep was missing a lot of basic stuff. For example not knowing how many litres/volume a bag is may be not expected for all products, again fine, but not knowing that an XPAC and nylon version of the same bag have the same volume is unexpected to me. I hung back for a lot and let my girlfriend ask her these questions because I didn’t want to jump in and answer when the sales rep was right there, but it seemed pretty odd that the rep had to look up almost everything. Had we worked with a manager I’m sure the thing would have been smoother. \n\nCheckout:\n\nCheckout process is easy. You get your item(s) in unbranded black paper shopping bags and get checked out on an iPhone with an NFC tap attachment. You can get email, Text, or paper receipts. We did get a little keychain for the grand opening, but I don’t think I’ll use it. The opening weekend offered 10% off but with NYC tax it’s basically just sticker price. In the past Aer didn’t charge me tax (TP3 purchase) so if I didn’t have the 10% off it would have actually cost MORE to shop in person. Hm? I was also slightly disappointed that they did not give any Aer holo stickers like I got when ordering online.\n\nOverall:\n\nOverall, glad that I have the store available to get hands on with things. It was a nice experience and I’m sure sales training and knowledge will improve over time for the presumably new employees. 7/10",

If I may, I will offer my own review of Aer’s new London (UK) store, which sounds very similar to the New York store.\nIt is located in Great Marlborough St, 5 mins walk from Oxford Circus in the most prestigious part of the West End. The store itself is small , probably about 8-900 square feet. It is sparsely furnished with shelving and a single table. All of the major products are on display, although it’s not obvious how they are organised. There’s a row of ‘Go’ items at the front, some ‘Pro’ items opposite and the Travel Packs and City Packs towards the rear of the store. There is one member of staff.\nI have bought three items from there over the past couple of months. Overall the staff are reasonably knowledgeable but the whole experience is so low key as to be unmemorable. Aers products are great, and they have a very premium, minimalist’vibe’. The store itself is so low key as to be almost forgettable It needs a bit more energy and the products need to be better showcased.",

You get your item(s) in unbranded black paper shopping bags and get checked out on an iPhone with an NFC tap attachment. You can get email, Text, or paper receipts. We did get a little keychain for the grand opening, but I don’t think I’ll use it. The opening weekend offered 10% off but with NYC tax it’s basically just sticker price. In the past Aer didn’t charge me tax (TP3 purchase) so if I didn’t have the 10% off it would have actually cost MORE to shop in person. Hm? I was also slightly disappointed that they did not give any Aer holo stickers like I got when ordering online.\n\nOverall:\n\nOverall, glad that I have the store available to get hands on with things. It was a nice experience and I’m sure sales training and knowledge will improve over time for the presumably new employees. 7/10",

If I may, I will offer my own review of Aer’s new London (UK) store, which sounds very similar to the New York store.\nIt is located in Great Marlborough St, 5 mins walk from Oxford Circus in the most prestigious part of the West End. The store itself is small , probably about 8-900 square feet. It is sparsely furnished with shelving and a single table. All of the major products are on display, although it’s not obvious how they are organised. There’s a row of ‘Go’ items at the front, some ‘Pro’ items opposite and the Travel Packs and City Packs towards the rear of the store. There is one member of staff.\nI have bought three items from there over the past couple of months. Overall the staff are reasonably knowledgeable but the whole experience is so low key as to be unmemorable. Aers products are great, and they have a very premium, minimalist’vibe’. The store itself is so low key as to be almost forgettable It needs a bit more energy and the products need to be better showcased.",

I bet in later months they will reduce staff like you said. It seriously was a tiny space as you could see in the photo I took so it is easy to have a “buzz” in the store if there’s even 8-10 people. I think it will suit them well. Good location with tons of foot traffic, being in soho. I feel like it would be a bit lost in other districts like meatpacking, flatiron, or Hudson  yards. I don’t know- just felt right for the brand.",

CPP has plenty of room to spare, so your whole back carries the weight. I hope this makes sense. \n\n- yes, the internal org, for daily carry purposes, is far superior in CP, in my opinion. It’s because CPP basically only has one pocket and a zipper pocket in the admin panel, with a large drop pocket making up the rest of the space.  If you don’t want it to look bulky, you can’t put much stuff in the CPP admin panel, either.  Meanwhile, you get four small pockets, a pens pocket, one mesh pocket, a zipper pocket, a large flat pocket, and a general drop pocket just in the admin area since it stretches all the way to the bottom. CPP does have two more pockets in the storage compartment, but they are a bit out of reach for daily carry items. \n\n- when CP is packed out, you must remove some items to access the laptop. Therefore, CPP’s separate compartment makes it much easier to access at the cost of added bulk. \n\n- I would love a mash-up of the two bags, honestly. The front panel of CP, separate laptop access of CPP, and maybe 1.5 inch reduction in the middle area of CPP. \n\n- For daily carry use with just light items, CP is far superior. You have enough room for a laptop, a tablet and all tech gear can be stored in the admin panel, eliminating the need for a tech pouch. You still have some space for a light jacket, a pouch, and umbrella or gym clothes (not shoes unless they’re are flat) in the main area. \n- You can actually fit a fully packed medium size packing cube in the CP (what I had in these pics), but it’ll stuff it up and make it feel heavy, as described above. \n- If you need to carry anything extra such as shoes, a lunch box, a thick jacket or hoodie, or packing cubes packed with clothes for light travel, CPP is a better choice. \n- CPP is best used around 2/3 full as it can get unwieldy beyond that for day to day use. \n- So here’s the gist, you can pack the CP as much as you could pack a CPP 2/3 full (optimal amount to keep it manageable.) CPP can handle the volume better but will need a tech pouch to keep things organized.  CP can handle it, too but at the cost of making the whole bag stiff. \n- So you should go with CP if you rarely need to pack it out (it’ll fit likely), but go with CPP if your daily carry needs include things like gym shoes,  thick hoodie/jacket, DSLR, or similarly bulky items.",

I decided to buy both the City Pack and [City Pack Pro in XPac.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ycqi8x/aer_city_pack_pro_xpac_impressions_and_pics/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). \n\nHere are some side-by-side comparisons. Some thoughts:\n\n- both are nearly identical in size once City Pack is fully packed out and pro is filled with the same content (about 2/3 full since it has more capacity)\n- the smaller City Pack is definitely sleeker looking of the two with my EDC items\n- CPP can fit a lot more and could be useful as my light travel bag (would work for week long trip to warm destinations that won’t require bulky clothes)\n- CPP can look bulkier once you start putting things in the front top panel pocket. \n- water bottle can get in the way of City Pack zipper operations (not an issue on the CPP since the zippers don’t end at the bottle pocket)\n- I need to return one and now it’s about looks vs. versatility (can’t decide!)\n\n\n[added some more details in a reply to someone here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ykp0k8/aer_city_pack_and_city_pack_pro_sidebyside/iuv1yra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)",

                "body": "Update 11/3/22 -\nDecided to return the smaller City Pack. My rationale:\n\n- While CP has better organization, it’s still isn’t enough for me to not use a separate tech pouch\n- CPP is roughly the same size as CP using the same daily load, but it gives me the option to load it up for trips. \n- CPP’s clamshell makes it easier to get at things that can end up at the bottom while traveling. \n- CPP feels lighter on my back when 2/3 full. CP can carry the same content, but it stretches the limit of the fabric and result in less surface area of the back panel touching my back. This makes CP feel heavier with max load. \n- In summary, both meet my EDC needs and even to be used as a personal item for flights.  CPP just gives me a bit extra room with the small sacrifice of not looking as sleek as CP. CPP is still a great looking bag!",

                "body": "So for the same load, it has the CPP around 2/3 full and just small flat items in the admin pockets. \n\n- Surprisingly, CPP feels lighter. It’s because CP gets very stiff when fully packed. The bulk of the items starts to stench out the back panel, reducing the contact surface area between your back and the backpack. CPP has plenty of room to spare, so your whole back carries the weight. I hope this makes sense. \n\n- yes, the internal org, for daily carry purposes, is far superior in CP, in my opinion. It’s because CPP basically only has one pocket and a zipper pocket in the admin panel, with a large drop pocket making up the rest of the space.  If you don’t want it to look bulky, you can’t put much stuff in the CPP admin panel, either.  Meanwhile, you get four small pockets, a pens pocket, one mesh pocket, a zipper pocket, a large flat pocket, and a general drop pocket just in the admin area since it stretches all the way to the bottom. CPP does have two more pockets in the storage compartment, but they are a bit out of reach for daily carry items. \n\n- when CP is packed out, you must remove some items to access the laptop. Therefore, CPP’s separate compartment makes it much easier to access at the cost of added bulk. \n\n- I would love a mash-up of the two bags, honestly. The front panel of CP, separate laptop access of CPP, and maybe 1.5 inch reduction in the middle area of CPP. \n\n- For daily carry use with just light items, CP is far superior. You have enough room for a laptop, a tablet and all tech gear can be stored in the admin panel, eliminating the need for a tech pouch. You still have some space for a light jacket, a pouch, and umbrella or gym clothes (not shoes unless they’re are flat) in the main area. \n- You can actually fit a fully packed medium size packing cube in the CP (what I had in these pics), but it’ll stuff it up and make it feel heavy, as described above. \n- If you need to carry anything extra such as shoes, a lunch box, a thick jacket or hoodie, or packing cubes packed with clothes for light travel, CPP is a better choice. \n- CPP is best used around 2/3 full as it can get unwieldy beyond that for day to day use. \n- So here’s the gist, you can pack the CP as much as you could pack a CPP 2/3 full (optimal amount to keep it manageable.) CPP can handle the volume better but will need a tech pouch to keep things organized.  CP can handle it, too but at the cost of making the whole bag stiff. \n- So you should go with CP if you rarely need to pack it out (it’ll fit likely), but go with CPP if your daily carry needs include things like gym shoes,  thick hoodie/jacket, DSLR, or similarly bulky items.",

            "body": "Hello.  It’s always hard to say about the comfort around a bag that’s been designed to do so many functions.  I haven’t tried any of these, but know in general the more functions a product has, the less good it is at doing any of them.  Durability shouldn’t be an issue since they’re all made with strong cordura.  However, as always, don’t go dragging your gear around like a toddler, and you should be fine durability wise.  \n\n14L feels a bit small, if you’re really minimalist then it should be fine, but I live in a colder climate and need to pack extra layers.  Also I’d rather have too much space than not enough.  20 liters is a nice balance for every day use.  \n\nI personally love x-pac.  It’s an amazing fabric, durable, lightweight, perfect for backpacks.  I’ve had an xpac wallet for 7 years and it’s just now starting to show wear.  I also love bright interiors, it’s significantly easier to find things.  \n\nHowever, I would never run around in pouring rain with my electronics in a bag like this.  If you think you’ll be out in rain, always always always keep electronics in a fully waterproof roll top bag.  Water can still get in through the zipper and seams, and even though many electronics are IPX rated nowadays, I still wouldn’t risk it.",

        "selftext": "I one bag for work trips. Usually 3-4 days. Pretty standard packing list of button down shirts/office clothes, plus toiletries, laptop and tech. \n\nI normally use a ULA Dragonfly, but I don't find it to be a great daypack at my destination. The look is just slightly too casual for most of the places I'm traveling for work.  It also feels very floppy when I remove all my clothes and toiletries to just carry my laptop and charger. \n\n  \nI've been looking at the AER Flight Pack 3 and Thule Subterra Hybrid travel bag as other options. Both are about 20L and have more of a 3-way briefcase style. A little bit smaller than the dragonfly, but I think I can make it work for most trips. Having the briefcase mode will be very nice for moving bags around offices and airplanes without always having to use the backpack straps. \n\n  \nWondering if anyone has done Onebag travel with either of these bags: \n\nAER Flight Pack 3\n\n[https://aersf.com/products/flight-pack](https://aersf.com/products/flight-pack)  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nbyzd7mjidwc1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87de6945ee97a721784f34c7109111c97701418f\n\nI haven't tried this one in person yet, but some reviews I found on Youtube showed that while it was a bit heavy, it can easily carry 1 large and 1 small packing cube. I normally need 2 small packing cubes for my trips. \n\n\n\nThule Subterra Hybrid Travel Bag  \n[https://www.thule.com/en-us/luggage/carry-on-luggage/thule-subterra-hybrid-travel-bag-\\_-3205061](https://www.thule.com/en-us/luggage/carry-on-luggage/thule-subterra-hybrid-travel-bag-_-3205061)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wz0668ekidwc1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da9aaec2df3d4a0294daa55be4bb2802ae7ea137\n\nI ordered this one from Amazon and did a test pack. It feels nice and the \"dark slate\" color is a nice subtle departure from basic black. No water bottle sleeve and the side meant to pack clothes has somewhat of a ridgid, rounded shape that is not as \"squishable\" as I might hope it to be. No compression straps, but it has a nice hidden expandable section that expands the briefcase from 15L to 23L. Its noticeably less capacity than the Dragonfly, but not by much, since the Dragonfly's 30L includes the stretch pockets. \n\nI'll probably try this on a test trip next week to see how it does. ",

Double the weight of Synapse25, imagine Synapse25 fully packed, that is AER TP3 empty. Too many organizations I dont need and I will not use.

It can stand on its own when properly packed as seen on the photos [[1]](https://i.imgur.com/q9I9i9a.jpg) [[2]](https://i.imgur.com/WdtgFAd.jpg)\n\n2. I can strap an M size jacket from Old Navy with no problem. Haven't had it snap open the fidlock yet\n\n3. The padding helps with the comfort and doesn't make the bag feel as heavy as it should be. The carry handles are very comfortable as well.\n\n4. Able to fit iunder the economy seat of a Korean Air 777-300ER  (77W) [[1]](https://i.imgur.com/2pkn4xP.jpg)\n\nGiven another chance, I would probably choose the ULA dragonfly over this, adjusting my packing habits as i would not need all the extra organization and reduce my overall load. Still pretty happy about the purchase.\n\nUpdate: Fits under the seat on a domestic PAL Airbus 320-200 with subjectively more leg room than on my international flight probably because of the IFE box.

A lot of the organization is also designed with EDC in mind, pockets for pens, notebooks, cables, and devices, not optimized for travel. Lastly, the weight of the bag for its size is just ridiculous, even in x-pac. \n\nSome less practical, and more personal knit-picks were that the bag is too rigid and structured, the buckled compression straps compressed quite minimally because the bag itself has such thick padding and material, the zippers were loud and jangly.\n\nAll-in-all, I think the pack is a solidly sleek EDC bag. Tons of organization for what I would carry going to the office everyday, or on a work trip. But it didn’t feel practical for shoving my life into one bag for a few days even as quite the UL traveler/backpacker.",

I do have them fully packed out on my bed though. (But quickly, the CPP is noticeably chunkier than the CP, regardless of packed/empty status. They hold their form.)\n\nHere they are packed with pretty loosely put together stuff. I couldn't fit everything in the CP, since the CPP is obviously bigger.\n\nSome things to note: the inner pockets in the CP are useless when fully packed. Yes, quite a bit fits in the 14L pack, but it is \\*uncomfortable\\* to take stuff out. The clamshell zip is a game-changer.\n\nAnother thing: I didn't include a laptop. It'll fit in the CPP thanks to the separate compartment. The CP? ...eh. Probably, but it'll suck the entire time you're using it.",

Total knockoffs? Made in the same factory and basically identical? Factory seconds and errors?\n\nTruth is it doesn't really matter. If you want companies to make good bags - and I think we all do here - then you need to support those companies. I don't see any way in which buying from ~~Lazada~~ Ali Express is realistically supporting Aer.",

All of the return policies are also unavailable for Europeans. \n\nSo, in terms of price and especially convenience, I'd say this is a great exchange (for Europeans).",

At 200+ I do expect a different tier of service and if I can't buy with peace of mind there's a lot of others in the arena that can.
