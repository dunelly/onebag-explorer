            "body": "Hi guys, I've got a number of Evergoods bags and pouches but my favourite at the moment is the Ecopak MLP22. I'm currently on a trip through central Australia heading north and using it as my hiking/dad bag.\n\nInside has a CAP0.5 with some emergency tools like a Leatherman, compass, lighter etc. In the front pouch is a CAP1 that has been setup as a first aid kit.\n\nI'm usually carrying 4 water bottles, two on the outside are the kids ones and then two inside for us adults. Then it's just bags of snacks/lunches and stuffed with whatever layers we shed over a days hiking.\n\nAs for comfort, maybe I'm lucky but with all my Evergoods bags I don't suffer from the sharp lower edge digging into my back. Infact the curve seems to work to open up the back and allow air to flow through, especially when going uphill and your back is straight. It almost feels like this is a feature to me, it's such a nice feeling! Size wise it's perfect for our smaller hikes, I think the biggest we've done is 12km on this trip and I've not had to cram anything in, it all just fits nicely.\n\nAll in all, I love this thing. Comfortable and well layed out. I'd been using it as a bit of a daily EDC before this trip and wasn't completely in love due to how the laptop area worked. But I can see that it wasn't really designed for EDC use. I also have a CTB26 that works really well for EDC use combined with travel, which I do quite a bit, but I think I'm now looking for that simple EDC bag that only has to carry the minimal amount for my day work trips. So maybe a CPL is on the cards for me now too",

I have resorted to buying insulated food pouches to keep the food from overheating. I have also thought about using a raincover to avoid directly exposing the backpack to the sunlight, but I doubt that’ll do much.

From 40L 2 years ago to 35L last year to this 30 L. Main features:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvzqfsvzekse1.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83a44abd622837e2ee96fb05cce5015c3e8faa69\n\n* Two external quick access zip pockets (you can see one with sunglass and the other with map in this pic). The top one has two non-zip internal pockets too and a key/lanyard hook\n* Dedicated chamber at the bottom, which I use to store snacks, waterproof toiletry pouch etc. One can store dirty clothes there, or extra footwear.\n* The main compartment is very spacious; two fully packed packing cubes can easily fit in with space to spare. I love the slotted zip design of main compartment instead of the suitcase style. Slanted zipper allows quick retrieval of packing cubes from the bag and no need to find a flat surface to open.\n* Bungee cord system (elastic webbing) in front is a huge plus; I use it to store wet towel, rain jacket etc\n* Triangular Clip attachment strip in front (not visible in image as this area is where the bag flap is folded); for attaching [rechargeable USB light](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8560549/cycling-light-rear-usb-cl100) while riding bike/walking in night etc\n* Chest and Hip straps\n* Dual zips are super smooth, but not YKK.\n* Additional zippered Internal secure pocket in main compartment to store essentials\n* Hydration Bladder compatible; bladder compartment has thick padding/cushioning suitable for laptop too.\n* External loops for hiking pole\n* Reflective loops in shoulder straps\n* Two bottle cages with deep pockets and straps that absolutely secures my 1.5L Nalgene Everyday Wide Mouth X 2 bottles on either side. The bottle straps also act as compression straps for the bag, so even when fully packed, the bag won't bulge out, an important aesthetic feature I really like.\n* The back panel is thickly padded with excellent ventillation\n* Dimensions passable as an under-seat laptop bag for budget EU/Asian airlines\n* Very inexpensive and very high volume to gram ratio (30L for 815g)\n* Sustainability: Decathlon offers repair service for this bag in their stores.\n\nWish future iterations of this bag offer:\n\n* Lockable zip (for hostel stays, for instance)\n* Padded hip belt. The current one is very basic\n* More reflective elements in front of the bag\n* Water resistance; but please, no PFOA/PFOS treatment. I use a waterproof cover, and its fine, too.",
