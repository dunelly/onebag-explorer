I've affectionately started calling her Bag Lady because she brings her work laptop bag, a duffel bag with clothes, a tote bag with her phone/waterbottle/book, her personal laptop bag for her fiction writing, and a tiny telfar purse for going out. Thats like 5 bags to pack just for Friday night to Monday morning every week and she has to walk up a long hill to get to my apartment from the car.\n\nHer duffel bag is old and falling apart so it would be nice to get her something stylish and practical to bring for the weekend that she could also repurpose for travel in the future if we move in together. \n\n**My budget is ~ $200-$250** \n\nHere's a few I've been looking at but I'm open to suggestions:\n\n1. [LO &amp; SONS Catalina Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/products/catalina-deluxe-organic-canvas-dove-grey)\n -its big and budget friendly but not very stylish\n\n2. [Nomad Lane Bento Bag](https://nomadlane.com/products/the-bento-bag)\n -very practical but it might be too professional for our usual Netflix&amp;chill type weekend in bed + over budget\n\n3. [AWAY Large Everywhere Bag](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/large-everywhere-bag?color=coast_nylon)\n- bonus points for a fun color,  leather straps and free customization but also the heaviest = least practical \n\n4. [Stella Mccartney for Adidas Nylon Travel Bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/luggage-and-travel/stella-mccartney-for-adidas-nylon-duffle-bag-hu6b7)\n-she showed me this one many months ago I think  just because she liked the blueish green color but it's sold and I have PTSD from buying her pre-owned gifts from therealreal before that arrived in poor condition :/\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Handbag homies! \n\nPlease help me buy my gf a nice weekender bag.\n\nContext:My gf(27) lives 45 minutes away in LA traffic and she makes the trip every Friday night to stay with me in my humble studio apartment for the weekend. I've affectionately started calling her Bag Lady because she brings her work laptop bag, a duffel bag with clothes, a tote bag with her phone/waterbottle/book, her personal laptop bag for her fiction writing, and a tiny telfar purse for going out. Thats like 5 bags to pack just for Friday night to Monday morning every week and she has to walk up a long hill to get to my apartment from the car.\n\nHer duffel bag is old and falling apart so it would be nice to get her something stylish and practical to bring for the weekend that she could also repurpose for travel in the future if we move in together. \n\n**My budget is ~ $200-$250** \n\nHere's a few I've been looking at but I'm open to suggestions:\n\n1. [LO &amp; SONS Catalina Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/products/catalina-deluxe-organic-canvas-dove-grey)\n -its big and budget friendly but not very stylish\n\n2. [Nomad Lane Bento Bag](https://nomadlane.com/products/the-bento-bag)\n -very practical but it might be too professional for our usual Netflix&amp;chill type weekend in bed + over budget\n\n3. [AWAY Large Everywhere Bag](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/large-everywhere-bag?color=coast_nylon)\n- bonus points for a fun color,  leather straps and free customization but also the heaviest = least practical \n\n4. [Stella Mccartney for Adidas Nylon Travel Bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/luggage-and-travel/stella-mccartney-for-adidas-nylon-duffle-bag-hu6b7)\n-she showed me this one many months ago I think  just because she liked the blueish green color but it's sold and I have PTSD from buying her pre-owned gifts from therealreal before that arrived in poor condition :/\n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "A little context: I’m a resident doctor that works 40-hour shifts and is in need of a good work bag that can carry everything, I want a bag that is cute and stylish but can also take a beating. Telfar is holding their last Bag Security Program, so I need answers fast.\n\nI’m tempted to get a Telfar in both medium and large for longer workdays, but I’m concerned about its durability. I like a good tote and the Telfar one is so stylish. I feel that if I don’t get one for work, I’ll probably buy one for going out.\n\nI plan to use the medium for my laptop and essentials, then the large for the days I go on duty when I need a change of clothes and shoes. My current bag situation is an H&amp;M tote which kind of looks like a Bottega Veneta Arco (which I will buy when I can afford it), and on busier days I just carry a backpack. I would like to be able to put everything in one bag.\n\nI was also considering getting a Cuyana as well for the luxurious real leather - although it is more expensive, I might be able to get more use out of it. On the other hand, I was considering getting a big Dagne Dover Landon duffel/tote which has a lot of space and pockets for long workdays.\n\nDo you think I should get a Telfar (or two) for work? If so, what colors would you recommend?",

Also, the handle drop is too short and is difficult to wear over a winter coat or a parka.\n- Rothy’s Bucket Tote — heavy base weight, too “floppy” and annoying to quickly look inside and reach for what you need, and there’s inadequate organization for my needs. I’ve also had quality issues with Rothy’s metal hardware on their bags / accessories getting very sticky and squeaky over time, so I think they have a long way to go in the handbag space. Their recycled plastic material is fine and their shoes are great (I’ve owned multiple pairs for many years) but the metal hardware used in their bags is poor quality.\n- Kate Spade Margaux Work Tote — laptop compartment was nice but cannot be moved from its placement dead-center in the bag, so you have no “flex” in what you can fit on either side of it. The laptop compartment itself also only fits up to 13” laptops and seems to be designed specifically for Apple MacBooks.

Also, the handle drop is too short and is difficult to wear over a winter coat or a parka.\n- Rothy’s Bucket Tote — heavy base weight, too “floppy” and annoying to quickly look inside and reach for what you need, and there’s inadequate organization for my needs. I’ve also had quality issues with Rothy’s metal hardware on their bags / accessories getting very sticky and squeaky over time, so I think they have a long way to go in the handbag space. Their recycled plastic material is fine and their shoes are great (I’ve owned multiple pairs for many years) but the metal hardware used in their bags is poor quality.\n- Kate Spade Margaux Work Tote — laptop compartment was nice but cannot be moved from its placement dead-center in the bag, so you have no “flex” in what you can fit on either side of it. The laptop compartment itself also only fits up to 13” laptops and seems to be designed specifically for Apple MacBooks. Once my work laptop was upgraded to a different non-Apple model that did not perfectly match MacBook dimensions, it no longer fit at all.",

The Luka felt like a black hole inside. No structure and didn’t really stay open when trying to pack it, so it was hard to see what was what inside.   \n\n3. The Landon has a nice phone-sized pocket on the outside and a keychain inside, neither of which are available on the Luka. The Luka does have a hidden outer pocket that can serve the same function but it’s big and you could still lose your phone or keys in its depths.   \n\n4. I do like the water bottle pouch on the outside of the Luka, I wish the Landon had something similar!  \n\nOverall the Landon just looked a little sleeker and was easier to unzip, pack, and find stuff in.",

It's very harsh against my outfits, though hides stains well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not a huge fan of the similar bags that have a shoe compartment underneath. It looks like two bags zipped together and I won't be putting shoes in this bag - just snacks, laptop, kindle, phone (outer pocket for phone is a plus), headphones, jacket. \n\nNeeds a crossbody or shoulder strap that isn't too thin, so it's easier to wear on the shoulder when needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBudget - $300.",
