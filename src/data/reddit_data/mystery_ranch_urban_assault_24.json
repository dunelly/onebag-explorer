I have been using it as an EDC bag and it’s nice to be able to throw a change of clothes and my camera in there on top of my normal stuff and not feel like it’s over stuffed. \n\nWhen empty it sits more flush when wearing and super comfortable. Only complaint is that it sags when sitting on the floor and it’s not fully loaded, which is 95% of the time",

        "selftext": "A few quick and simple mods to my MR UA21\n\nHey guys! Long time lurker, first time poster here.\nI figured it might be interesting (or entertaining, at least) for some of you folks to see some very simple work I did on my well used Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21 for it to better suit my needs.\n\nFirst of all, I can't hide the fact that I love heat shrink tubing. I use it on almost all of my zipper pulls, both on clothes and on bags. I'll either apply it to the whole zipper pull to make it stiff or just to the knots to have a more tactile end to grab. Then of course, my UA21 could be no different. I decided not to completely enclose the cord pulls though so I can still use a small S-biner to secure them to one another in case I need further protection from pickpockets or similar.\n\nThe second very simple but very useful mod I did was attaching some elastic cordage to control the remaining webbing. You basically need to put the shock cord through the loop at the end of the strap and then tie it to the working  part of the webbing that is under tension, then roll it up and call it a day. Heat shrink on the knot is not necessary but... what can I say?\n\nThe last thing I did was replacing the black zipper pulls on the inside pockets with bright fuchsia ones. I am certainly not a fan of dark bag interiors and I thought these would be just enough to help me locate those pockets faster.\n\nSo, finishing up, what are some modifications you guys like to do to your own bags? Do yo recommend any in particular?",

Long time lurker, first time poster here.\nI figured it might be interesting (or entertaining, at least) for some of you folks to see some very simple work I did on my well used Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21 for it to better suit my needs.\n\nFirst of all, I can't hide the fact that I love heat shrink tubing. I use it on almost all of my zipper pulls, both on clothes and on bags. I'll either apply it to the whole zipper pull to make it stiff or just to the knots to have a more tactile end to grab. Then of course, my UA21 could be no different. I decided not to completely enclose the cord pulls though so I can still use a small S-biner to secure them to one another in case I need further protection from pickpockets or similar.\n\nThe second very simple but very useful mod I did was attaching some elastic cordage to control the remaining webbing. You basically need to put the shock cord through the loop at the end of the strap and then tie it to the working  part of the webbing that is under tension, then roll it up and call it a day. Heat shrink on the knot is not necessary but... what can I say?\n\nThe last thing I did was replacing the black zipper pulls on the inside pockets with bright fuchsia ones. I am certainly not a fan of dark bag interiors and I thought these would be just enough to help me locate those pockets faster.\n\nSo, finishing up, what are some modifications you guys like to do to your own bags? Do yo recommend any in particular?",

(if you bring them back, they are once again in your backpack, and if you throw them out, you wasted money.)\n\nIt’s reassuring to just land and have all the items you need so you can focus on your experience, and may be better on the budget.\n\nPractical response:\nbut this works better if you thin down to only the amount you actually need for your trip, and I think that is really why people are talking about it.\n\nyou have a giant stack of wet wipes for 10 days. you have a whole bottle of what looks like pain medicine. You have whole bars of soap, I imagine, in those boxes. \n\nYou can save yourself some weight right there. Just the right number of pills can generally go in a plastic bag. You might be able to get a smaller container of wet wipes in the travel section at a big box store like Walmart.\n\nYou can definitely cut a bar of soap in half (or less) to cover 10 days, and you don’t need all those pairs of ear plugs. \n\nI don’t know what the official rule is, but you should be able to get a couple nights sleep out of each one at the bare minimum. 3-5 pairs is almost overpacking and is a good start. \n\nPraise: everything is nice and tidy and fits really well in your backpack with your packing cubes.

I love going to grocery stores in different countries too for the same reason. Doing a boring, routine errand in another country makes me feel at home there for a bit, if that makes any sense.

Plus I’ve found 2 of my most favourite products ever by exploring brands I can’t get in Canada or never noticed in Canada!\n\nLearn to love ziplocks.

            "body": "TLDR: the tri-zip is my JAM, prefer it way over the ol’ clamshell. Super easy to rip the top open and center zip makes it easy to quickly get to bottom of bag without guessing which side my ish is hiding. Comfy but maybe not as life changing some claim about MR harnesses.  And MR’s 500d coyote looks fantastic.\n\nLOADOUT\n\nMain pocket:\n- 14” laptop\n- 1” file folder\n- Evergoods cap2l\n- Small tool pouch\n- A5 notebook\n- Camelbak chute mag 750ml\n\nQuick access pocket\n- Work phone\n- Key bundle\n- Earbuds\n- Compact tissue pack\n\nInner pockets:\n- Alcohol wipes\n- Pocket notebook\n- Packable travel hand towel\n- Packable shopping bag\n- Protein bar\n- hand salve\n- lip balm\n\nLemme say it first, i freakin love the tri-zip! MR’s option of top access and center access just makes sense to me. I'm usually commuting in a tight subway or bus to surprisingly tighter confines of various coworking spaces, and being able to open or rather RIP OPEN the top is really handy and kinda fun. Nevermind, the triangular wedge shape just lends itself to this design and method: genius.\n\nAnd if i wanna find something in the bottom, the center zip lets me get to either side of the bag, while keeping other items above from spilling out. With a clamshell, i’d have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct side the item in question decided to hide and most times i chose poorly.\n\nMy only real prob is the lack of a place to put my pen or sharpie. But i made due by just clipping them to the end of the laptop strap, wrapping the velcro around them, and letting them dangle in the bag. Actually been kinda helpful, cause i can just tug on the strap and quickly fish out the pen from the bag.\n\nDo i need an outer water bottle pocket? Not really. Grabbing it either top side or from the center zip has worked fine for me. And id rather keep it hidden away from random subway drips, random coughs, and whatever else the city wants to randomly dribble on it.\n\nIn conclusion, does it remind me of the flux capacitor? Yes.",

            "body": "TLDR: the tri-zip is my JAM, prefer it way over the ol’ clamshell. Super easy to rip the top open and center zip makes it easy to quickly get to bottom of bag without guessing which side my ish is hiding. Comfy but maybe not as life changing some claim about MR harnesses.  And MR’s 500d coyote looks fantastic.\n\nLOADOUT\n\nMain pocket:\n- 14” laptop\n- 1” file folder\n- Evergoods cap2l\n- Small tool pouch\n- A5 notebook\n- Camelbak chute mag 750ml\n\nQuick access pocket\n- Work phone\n- Key bundle\n- Earbuds\n- Compact tissue pack\n\nInner pockets:\n- Alcohol wipes\n- Pocket notebook\n- Packable travel hand towel\n- Packable shopping bag\n- Protein bar\n- hand salve\n- lip balm\n\nLemme say it first, i freakin love the tri-zip! MR’s option of top access and center access just makes sense to me. I'm usually commuting in a tight subway or bus to surprisingly tighter confines of various coworking spaces, and being able to open or rather RIP OPEN the top is really handy and kinda fun. Nevermind, the triangular wedge shape just lends itself to this design and method: genius.\n\nAnd if i wanna find something in the bottom, the center zip lets me get to either side of the bag, while keeping other items above from spilling out. With a clamshell, i’d have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct side the item in question decided to hide and most times i chose poorly.\n\nMy only real prob is the lack of a place to put my pen or sharpie. But i made due by just clipping them to the end of the laptop strap, wrapping the velcro around them, and letting them dangle in the bag. Actually been kinda helpful, cause i can just tug on the strap and quickly fish out the pen from the bag.\n\nDo i need an outer water bottle pocket? Not really. Grabbing it either top side or from the center zip has worked fine for me. And id rather keep it hidden away from random subway drips, random coughs, and whatever else the city wants to randomly dribble on it.\n\nIn conclusion, does it remind me of the flux capacitor? Yes.",

            "author": "SaltyMargaritas",
            "body": "**Materials and overall look**\n\nFor a while I've been a proud owner of Mystery Ranch's Urban Assault 21, which is a highly recommended bag on this subreddit. The colorway is called Wood Waxed, which is soft to the touch and has an unassuming rustic look. According to Mystery Ranch on their website, the Wood Waxed UA21's material is a \"polyester blend with a Polyurethane based coating on it.\" It certainly feels much like a waxed canvas bag and scratching it will leave little white marks on the material, so it develops a patina with everyday use. The material feels quite pleasant to interact with actually and oddly reminds me of velvet.\n\n**Organization and tri-zip design**\n\nI purchased the bag because I sometimes take weekend getaway trips with my wife and my other smaller backpacks don't cut it when I need to bring a change of clothes, toiletries and some other stuff with me. The UA21 comes with a solid harness system and Mystery Ranch's intuitive tri-zip design which allows me to open up the whole main compartment. This makes the bag easy to pack without leaving any empty space between items. However, I've been using it as an everyday bag as well to experience how it wears and breaks in. It has served me really well as an EDC bag and despite its simple-looking exterior, it offers some solid organization. When I use the UA21 as an EDC bag, I usually just open the top flap to access the main compartment, but the tri-zip design has turned out to be really useful when I get some groceries for example. Then I can just lay the bag down on its back, open it up completely and fill it up quickly yet carefully without randomly having to throw everything in there through the top opening.\n\nI really like the cavernous pocket in the top flap of this bag where I can keep essential items, like a little knife, multitool, flashlight, lighter, mask, etc. It's very convenient to just put the bag down, open the top flap's zippered pocket and get whatever small item I might need. There are also two small mesh-lined internal pockets on both sides of the bag, near the top. I've been keeping my laptop's charger and cables in one of them. Really nice to have a specific and easily accessible internal pocket for my charger.\n\n**Water-resistance and zippers**\n\nMy UA21 was put through a serious rain test last night when I was outside for over an hour while it poured, and the little top pocket (or lid pocket as Mystery Ranch calls it) stayed completely dry inside.\n\nIt helps that all of the UA21's zippers are coated and very water-resistant. The main compartment's zippers are actually quite stiff so opening it up takes a bit of force. I actually have two minor criticisms and one has to do with the zippers. I don't mind the stiffness of the zippers, because they are chunky and coated, and even add a sense of security, but the zippers tend to get stuck in a few specific spots that have some webbing inside just near the zippers, especially when I unzip the main compartment slowly. The top lid's little pocket opens up really easily and nicely though.\n\n**Laptop sleeve**\n\nThe UA21 also has both a laptop and tablet sleeve. I quite like having two separate sleeves because the smaller one works well for my Kindle or especially my [flat essentials pouch](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/q8n8yn/tom_bihns_double_organizer_pouch_is_my_absolute/). While those sleeves are suspended, promising some protection if I were to accidentally drop the bag, my second small criticism is the lack of bottom padding. There is none, in fact. Maybe I'm just used to having bags that have decent bottom padding, but I definitely had to remind myself to put the bag down carefully today because I had a glass item inside. Also I always carry a chunky power bank which is at the very bottom of the bag and it definitely will take a beating if I throw the bag around.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nWhat I really love about the UA21 is the comfort. The bag's narrow and tall profile seemed a bit unusual to me at first, but since I'm a tall guy, its peculiar shape really fits my body well. The straps and back panel are just super comfortable and the weight distribution is excellent because I keep many items in the small pockets in the top part of the bag. I carried a lot of tech stuff today and the bag felt really light to wear. The UA21 has made me realise that a 6'22'' person like myself really benefits from having an EDC bag that is over 20 inches long.\n\n**Consensus**\n\nOverall I really love this bag, and it's certainly the type of bag that will last a long time. Although I initially purchased the bag for weekend trips, I'm happily using it as an EDC bag now. If you have any questions about it, feel free to ask. I definitely didn't talk about some additional features, like MOLLE webbing on the bottom, and the removable sternum strap, but I reviewed every part of the bag that I've been interacting with a lot.",

This does great for now - especially since I started relying on dedicated organization pouches and such rather than using pockets and pouches integrated into packs. I've found that makes it way easier to access things and swap items out if my needs change.\n\nAs for caribiners, I actually do have a Nite-Ize S-Biner on the tab on each of the laptop pocket zip. They work well for adding a water bottle if needed because (as you surely know) the external pockets are super tight when packed out. I do keep a slim water bottle in the tall pocket inside, but sometimes I grab a second if I'll be out for a while. Sometimes I will also add the [CapSnap](https://www.dsptch.com/products/capsnap) for attaching a hat to the outside.\n\nIf I could change 2 things about this pack it would be:\n\n\\- Flat bottom so it would stand up on its own\n\n\\- Horseshoe zip for the lid pocket, similar to what's on the 1-Day Assault Pack. I love the pocket on that, but the pack is a little too small overall for my EDC loadout.",

I am primarily writing this because I was curious about the differences between the UA 21L and 24L. Hopefully this gives a little insight on the two bags for anyone that is curious!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Size**\n\nI do thoroughly enjoy this 21L over the 24L for EDC. It feels much more compact and reasonable to carry around everywhere. When the 24L is not fully packed, it feels a little large and clunky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\n[21L Internal Organizational](https://imgur.com/a/vIYgF6g)\n\n[24L Internal Organizational](https://imgur.com/a/w4xiNxa)\n\nI originally thought my largest gripe with the 21L bag was going to be the lack of water bottle holders on either side. Even though the 24L has designated spots for water bottles, they are so tight that I feel like I can’t fit any of my normal reusable bottles in the compartment comfortably anyways. It turns out, I don’t really mind not having any permanent water bottle holders on the 21L.\n\nThe largest con of the 21L turns out to be the lack of internal organization. On the inside, besides the laptop/iPad sleeve, you get 2 tiny zippered pockets. With the 24L, there are multiple internal compartments which were great for storing cables, chargers, pens, notepads etc. Things that I feel are reasonable to carry everyday. I believe if they had included proper organizational pockets - which I very much so believe they could have fit in this size - I would be rating this bag an “A”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Material**\n\nIn my opinion, \"Waxed Wood\" material is by far superior to any of the other materials I have felt. It still gives a sense of durability without having it feel completely stiff. I always griped with the 500 D Cordura fabric - it felt way too rigid for my liking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall**\n\nAfter owning both, I would say that the 21L in \"Waxed Wood\" is the winner. I am going to solve the internal organizational issues with some organizers and hopefully that solves that problem. I wasn't sure the 3L delta was going to make much of a difference, but it surely made it feel much more reasonable to carry on a daily basis.",

Sometimes it has a hardcore green hue to the bag giving it a very military esque look whilst other times it looks almost stonewash grey. Though, the zippers remain a very caramel brown regardless of its exposure.\n\nI don't believe it to actually be canvas, still Cordura.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/cs9pqn/mystery_ranch_urban_assault_24l_quick_look_and/",
        "selftext": "I've been looking for a new EDC/ travel bag. I've always been really interested in getting a Mystery Ranch so when I saw the new Urban Assault 24 I picked it up. There was another post about it in r/manybaggers but for some reason they deleted it. I've had it for a week now and loaded it out in a \"travel\" configuration to get a feel for how it carries. I'm comparing it to my Goruck because thats a pretty common bag to hear suggested. \n\n\n[HERE's](https://i.imgur.com/brvxgK9.jpg) what I pack into them. The packing cube is about 15\"x12\"x5\", a 14\" X1 laptop, a make-shift toiletry kit, sunglasses case, goruck wire dopp with a few things, flashlight, and phone charger. \n\n\n[THE MAIN COMPARTMENT](https://i.imgur.com/A5QXzLW.jpg) [PIC2](https://i.imgur.com/6utc3HW.jpg): The packing cube slid right in, the bathroom kit and sunglasses sit on top, and the laptop brick fit pretty well into one of the side pockets, although I couldn't zip it up. The wire dopp even slid easily into the tablet pouch. Overall I was pretty shocked with how well everything fit. I could get to everything in the main compartment with only unzipping the top, except the packing cube, and there was still some space left on top. The smooth liners really helped slide things in and out too.  9/10\n\n\n[TOP POCKET](https://i.imgur.com/FCYoMiv.jpg): A generously sized pocket, all the little things I would want access to during a trip fit in. I really like how it has its own dedicated space, nothing was getting squeezed together. You had to kind of pull the zippers apart to get into it though.  8/10\n\n\nCOMFORT: The bag weighed 17lbs loaded. It felt like about 2/3rds the weight was on my shoulders and 1/3 rested on the lowerback/hips. The straps have good padding and are soft. 7/10\n\n\nUSABILITY: Everything is readily accessibly- laptop, water bottle, stash pouch. For some reason, maybe the smoother material, it was really easy to slide the backpack on and off, I loved that. Packing is extremely easy, everything has the perfect spot. The slant on the bottom of the pack meant it liked to tip over if you didn't hold it upright with your legs. 9/10\n\n\nThe Goruck:\n\nNOTE:  This is a Rucker 2.0, but I wanted to compare the MR to a GR1 so I removed the laptop from the packing list to make up for the lack of a dedicated laptop compartment. I clipped a full water bottle to the outside to make up for the lost weight in the comfort testing.\n\n\n[MAIN COMPARTMENT](https://i.imgur.com/7otqABF.jpg): It took a little longer to find a way to make the layout work. At first I had the packing cube at the bottom and everything else stuffed in the top, but that wasn't working, so I put everything on the bottom and that worked better. It's a game of tetris, finding the right sized pouches and items, and fitting it in. The wire dopp fit in the bottom zipper pocket, but everything was so tight that the slanted pocket was completely worthless. The small pocket fit the charger, light, etc but was also tight and not even an extra wallet would fit in. 6/10\n\n\nUSABILITY: The water bottle was relatively easy to access by keeping the zipper on the side, so was the small pocket, but you do have to be more aware of things falling out. Less wanting to tip over then the MR. 7/10\n\n\nCOMFORT: 17lbs loaded, about 50% weight on shoulders and 50% on hips. The thick back padding helps transfer more weight off your shoulders. 8.5/10\n\n\nOVERALL SHOOTOUT WINNER: I expected a much closer fight, but the MR blew the Goruck out of the water IMO. I thought the square design would have a bigger packing advantage, but I was shocked with how well everything just fight right into thee MR. The smooth liners, and 4 extra L probably helped a lot. The water bottle holder and top stash pocket are fantastic.",

            "body": "Interesting comparison. Thanks. The MR won overall, but sounds like the Goruck was the clear winner in terms of comfort, which is puzzling since I'd rate MR straps with load lifters, mesh back and sternum strap higher than Goruck's basic design in my experience. The thick straps of the GR1 and its boxy shape make it far more comfortable than it looks, but when its not comfortable there's very little you can do in terms of adjustments.\n\nI also tend to rate comfort higher up the list of important stuff vs. organization in general, and TBH pretty much every other pack will beat a Goruck when it comes to main compartment organization and usability. Gorucks are big blank slates on which you impose your own order, which is one of the things I like about them. Sure, not cheap once you buy molle organizers etc. but ultimately a better solution for some folks. Strap an organizer pocket into the top of the main compartment and a water bottle holder (or two) onto the sides and you have a very flexible pack.\n\nI'm curious how you found the tri-zip MR system vs the more traditional Goruck clamshell design. I'm so used to fully opening up a clamshell pack that arranging stuff in is never a problem. Also curious if the MR will stand up on the floor. It looks like it would want to tip forward.\n\nThe UA24 (and related 2DAP) is certainly a pack I've had my eye on. Just seems more convenient than faffing around trying to customize a Goruck and TBH I rarely use my GR1 now I have other more EDC-centric packs.",

I put my hair dryer and portable bidet in the inner ones, water bottle and jacket/umbrella in the outer ones.

My ONE complaint is that the 24L sits pretty far from the back even with the load lifters pulled as tight as they'll go, so it's not the most comfortable bag when carrying a full load for a long time. I have the 21L in the same color and it's much more comfortable because it doesn't have the laptop area so it sits closer to the back. But for the looks and the amount it can hold in such a compact package and the just-enough organization, it's a winner. This is my go-to non-work (read: don't need a suit) weekend trip bag.",

Certainly not less than a stretchy pocket unless the pocket goes above the top of the bottle. I find it works well, and it's nice knowing that it will absolutely last with the rest of the pack, and won't wear out. Just be cognizant that if you overpack the bag to a ridiculous extent, it might be tough to get your bottle in there.",

Somehow more capable than 27L I reckon. But in exchange I don't have that handsome and firm top cap anymore. A very useful beaver tail to hold my helmet for biking. As well as the zipper space on two sides. One thing to complain about this though, those two spaces cannot really hold much stuff. Either the main conpartment takes up the room or the other way around. And the quick access back zipper, at least for me, is not that \"quick\".   \n  \n\r\rWith all that, I wish I can just combine best of all worlds. Do some minor fixes. All the 2day and Unicorn good sides and leave out the bad. And use that 3/4 length back zipper which can open the bag almost in half. Saw it somewhere else, someone built it from scratch. If only I can get something like this, it would be perfect for me.",
