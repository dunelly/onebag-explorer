I also bought the Osprey Roll Organizer toiletry bag (slightly different color). And just like the backpack, it has hidden surprises.\n\nThis is not just a bag, it’s techwear. It comes in two parts:\n\n* A main 40L bag\n* A \"baby\" 15L bag\n\nTotal weight: only 1.9 kg.\n\nThe small bag comes attached at the bottom of the main bag with a small hook and at the top with two clips on the main bag to become ONE bag! The small bag can also be attached to the front, clipped onto the straps of the big one. The big bag is designed to lighten the load with its own suspension system. And bonus: both bags have a built-in whistle.",

From what I’ve read/watched on YouTube I’ve narrowed my search to bags with a capacity between 35-40 L around the $300 ish CAD. I won’t be packing any laptops or camera equipment, mainly just clothes and toiletries. Im currently looking at the Cotopaxi Allpa 35-42L or an Osprey Farpoint. Was hoping you guys would be able to steer me in the direction of the right bag, any other suggestions are welcome. Thanks!",

I’ve never backpacked before so I don’t have a great idea on what I’ll appreciate in a bag. Will be bouncing from city to city staying in hostels and taking atleast 6 flights while I’m there. From what I’ve read/watched on YouTube I’ve narrowed my search to bags with a capacity between 35-40 L around the $300 ish CAD. I won’t be packing any laptops or camera equipment, mainly just clothes and toiletries. Im currently looking at the Cotopaxi Allpa 35-42L or an Osprey Farpoint. Was hoping you guys would be able to steer me in the direction of the right bag, any other suggestions are welcome. Thanks!",

The only system keeping the two bags together is the belt through the loops. Can’t find buckles or anything. Am I missing something?\n\nI tried looking for relevant info online, but they almost all pertain to the older version of 55L.\n\n ",

The hip belt hugs and transfers most of the weight to the hips and I barely notice any weight on my shoulders.\n\nUnfortunately, I think I will return the bag as it is way too big for my needs (my fault, I know... Saw it at my local sports store and figured I'd try it out). In the picture I've loaded it up.\n\nI've been looking.for my \"perfect\" EDC bag for a while now. I work 14 hour days, I like to bring books a meal and snacks, clothing as the weather sometimes varies etc. I think my ideal size now is somewhere between 35-45 liters. I really like the organization of the vanquest markhor 45, sog Seraphim 35l, and vertex gamut overland, but I don't want a \"military look\" bag. Which is why I started looking at hiking backpacks.\n\nI also like the look of the wandrd Prvke but I'm not sure if that would have the comfort like a hiking pack. I hurt my back last summer so any opportunity to take weight off my back is a good idea for me.\n\nIf you have an ideas feel free to suggest something.",

One pair of athletic shorts can work for swimming, exercise, and casual wear (I use a pair of Patagonia running shorts for all these things). If you make sure to use quick drying materials, then 4 shirts (t shirt, undershirt (heattech), short sleeve/polo, long sleeve button down) would usually be perfectly sufficient. You may find that a long sleeve button down is a good staple shirt even in the warmer climate of Southern Asia because of mosquitoes in the evening, and maybe sun protection during the day (if you burn easily).\n\nI usually bring a long sleeved rash vest when I’m planning to go swimming in the tropics, which doubles as a hiking shirt or running top. YMMV.",

        "selftext": "Went to the Yucatán over Christmas with my young family and wanted to share some onebag thoughts. Second fully one bag trip for my family of 4 was a success but I still learned a lot. We had a blast and traveling light allowed us to be really mobile using the excellent ADO bus system and local colectivos with ease. The kids are 4 and 7 and still don’t carry anything themselves and I’m often shoulder caring the young one while carrying my 40L. Flew Transat from Toronto and had no problem with our stuff in the overhead bins. \n\nManaged to fit everybody’s stuff in three bags including 23 overnight diapers, a child’s life jacket, 4 sets of masks/snorkels and two Christmas presents from Santa. This will hopefully be the last year with diapers which was almost a quarter of one of the bags. We obviously could have bought diapers while we were there but we moved around a lot and so would still have to carry them somehow. We stayed in six different hotels from the city (Merida) to the beach (Cozumel) and a few places in between. \n\nWe basically brought four of everything which was too much and only ended up wearing half of it, doing quick sink laundry every night with Bohners peppermint and drying on a length of paracord strung across the room overnight. Next trip I will pack 2 sets of everything plus the clothes on my back. \n\nAlso brought too much cash which was bulky and a little nerve racking with the huge wade spread across the three bags and our fanny packs. No FX fee credit card worked at lots of places and taking out cash from the banks turned out to not be a problem. \n\nWe’re still committed to Santa so we had to bring to bring two little gifts from the Big Man for our kids, could have bought something there but it was nice to have that all sorted. \n\nI honestly can’t believe that we actually brought so many diapers and the lifejacket. They’re obviously really lightweight but we’re super bulky. The young one did use the lifejacket a lot though and the diapers took up less room with each night. The masks and snorkels were great for the half the time we wanted them and there really wasn’t anywhere to rent them where we were staying so I’m glad we had them. \n\nAll in all, a great trip and I’m so glad that we onebagged. It made it so easy to navigate and travel around with ease and it was so nice to not have a bunch of unnecessary junk to organize with all our moving. \n\nI’ll answer any questions if you have about onebagging with two young kids or anything else.",
