            "body": "I just got my CTB26 last week, and since I recently took a weekend trip to Chicago I thought it might be helpful for people to see how I packed things out in my CPL24.\n\nFor context, I only brought the CPL24 on the trip. I normally travel with a backpack and wheeled suitcase (carry-on), but wanted to keep things light for this trip.\n\nThings I packed:\n\n* Peak design medium packing cube\n* Rain jacket\n* Peak design toiletry case\n* 16\" Macbook Pro M1\n* iPad Mini\n* Ricoh GR III\n* Charging cables\n* Sunglasses\n* Spare battery\n* Snacks\n\nThe pictures show what I packed and how it all fit, but here's some **notes about the CPL24**:\n\n* The CPL24 fit everything, but it was very very snug. I couldn't fit it anything else.\n* The CPL24 was very comfortable even when fully packed out. Walking through airports was no issue.\n* I wasn't able to fit my Sony a7IV in the CPL24 so I had to travel with my Ricoh GR III as my only camera. It worked out great, but I missed my bigger camera.\n* I've travel a few times with the CPL24 and I've found things to get a bit tight pretty quickly.\n* The CPL24 fit under the airplane seat no problem.\n\nI haven't actually used the CTB26 yet, but here's some first impressions:\n\n* It fit everything from my Chicago trip with room to spare. The extra front pocket is going to come in handy.\n* Walking around my home, the bag feels similar to the CPL24. I can def tell it's larger, but comfort feels like it will be the same.\n* I like the more flexible material. Seems like it will make the bag flex and compress better. This is a personal preference.\n* The luggage pass-through is a nice bonus since I normally travel with a carry-on wheeled suitcase.\n* The water bottle pockets are going to be sooooo nice for travel.\n\nI'm likely going to be selling the CPL24 since I don't see myself every using both. The CTB26 seems like a hit to me. Gives me the same great experience of the CPL24, but a little more space a functionality for travel (which was my main use for the CPL24).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer.\n\nEdit: added packing info",

I normally travel with a backpack and wheeled suitcase (carry-on), but wanted to keep things light for this trip.\n\nThings I packed:\n\n* Peak design medium packing cube\n* Rain jacket\n* Peak design toiletry case\n* 16\" Macbook Pro M1\n* iPad Mini\n* Ricoh GR III\n* Charging cables\n* Sunglasses\n* Spare battery\n* Snacks\n\nThe pictures show what I packed and how it all fit, but here's some **notes about the CPL24**:\n\n* The CPL24 fit everything, but it was very very snug. I couldn't fit it anything else.\n* The CPL24 was very comfortable even when fully packed out. Walking through airports was no issue.\n* I wasn't able to fit my Sony a7IV in the CPL24 so I had to travel with my Ricoh GR III as my only camera. It worked out great, but I missed my bigger camera.\n* I've travel a few times with the CPL24 and I've found things to get a bit tight pretty quickly.\n* The CPL24 fit under the airplane seat no problem.\n\nI haven't actually used the CTB26 yet, but here's some first impressions:\n\n* It fit everything from my Chicago trip with room to spare. The extra front pocket is going to come in handy.\n* Walking around my home, the bag feels similar to the CPL24. I can def tell it's larger, but comfort feels like it will be the same.\n* I like the more flexible material. Seems like it will make the bag flex and compress better. This is a personal preference.\n* The luggage pass-through is a nice bonus since I normally travel with a carry-on wheeled suitcase.\n* The water bottle pockets are going to be sooooo nice for travel.\n\nI'm likely going to be selling the CPL24 since I don't see myself every using both. The CTB26 seems like a hit to me. Gives me the same great experience of the CPL24, but a little more space a functionality for travel (which was my main use for the CPL24).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer.\n\nEdit: added packing info",

            "body": "I just got my CTB26 last week, and since I recently took a weekend trip to Chicago I thought it might be helpful for people to see how I packed things out in my CPL24.\n\nFor context, I only brought the CPL24 on the trip. I normally travel with a backpack and wheeled suitcase (carry-on), but wanted to keep things light for this trip.\n\nThings I packed:\n\n* Peak design medium packing cube\n* Rain jacket\n* Peak design toiletry case\n* 16\" Macbook Pro M1\n* iPad Mini\n* Ricoh GR III\n* Charging cables\n* Sunglasses\n* Spare battery\n* Snacks\n\nThe pictures show what I packed and how it all fit, but here's some **notes about the CPL24**:\n\n* The CPL24 fit everything, but it was very very snug. I couldn't fit it anything else.\n* The CPL24 was very comfortable even when fully packed out. Walking through airports was no issue.\n* I wasn't able to fit my Sony a7IV in the CPL24 so I had to travel with my Ricoh GR III as my only camera. It worked out great, but I missed my bigger camera.\n* I've travel a few times with the CPL24 and I've found things to get a bit tight pretty quickly.\n* The CPL24 fit under the airplane seat no problem.\n\nI haven't actually used the CTB26 yet, but here's some first impressions:\n\n* It fit everything from my Chicago trip with room to spare. The extra front pocket is going to come in handy.\n* Walking around my home, the bag feels similar to the CPL24. I can def tell it's larger, but comfort feels like it will be the same.\n* I like the more flexible material. Seems like it will make the bag flex and compress better. This is a personal preference.\n* The luggage pass-through is a nice bonus since I normally travel with a carry-on wheeled suitcase.\n* The water bottle pockets are going to be sooooo nice for travel.\n\nI'm likely going to be selling the CPL24 since I don't see myself every using both. The CTB26 seems like a hit to me. Gives me the same great experience of the CPL24, but a little more space a functionality for travel (which was my main use for the CPL24).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer.\n\nEdit: added packing info",

            "body": "Ok, I’ve been lurking in this forum forever, marveling at how people can actually travel extensively with just one bag, sometimes less than 20L in size. I caught the bug and decided to give it a shot. It didn’t go exactly as planned, but I learned some things for the next go round.\n\nI had a late winter 4 day trip to NYC coming up and decided to use this short excursion to try one bagging. I considered a lot of different packs for this, ranging from 20 to 40 liters. Ultimately I settled on something that was smaller yet flexible, so I could use it as luggage, as a daypack on the trip and then as my daily EDC pack when not traveling. After much deliberation and testing out a few different packs, I settled on the Evergoods CPL24. I even managed to find a reasonably priced, barely-used CPL24 V3 Mirror in the B/S/T thread here that fit the bill perfectly.\n\nHowever, on the day of departure discussions were had and I ultimately added a second, smaller satchel which I use for my normal EDC (Nutsac 13). We were traveling with a big group that included a lot of younger adults and kids and we decided the extra space would be useful for reasons. I did manage to fit the satchel in the CPL at first, but just barely. It was bursting at the seams so I ended up just carrying them separately, turning my whole one bag endeavor into a typical two bag trip. However, I packed and loaded everything in the CPL before leaving and, if not for the last minute necessary inclusion of the second bag, the CPL24 would have handled everything perfectly on its own.\n\nAnyway, here’s how the trip, and the pack, worked out …\n\nWe flew from TX to NY for the 4 day trip. The weather in NYC was all over the map; The first two days stayed in the 20’s &amp; 30’s F with driving snow / rain and constant 20+ mph winds while the last two days switched up to a comparatively balmy 50-60F, sunny with a light breeze. I needed to pack for wet, windy winter and then warm spring conditions. So, with a couple packing cubes and some strategic clothes selections, I managed to load up the CPL with all the necessary stuff. I tossed my EDC items and tablet into my Nutsac for easy access during the flight. Once at the hotel, I offloaded the packing cubes and used the CPL as a daypack the first two days. We were involved in a lot of group oriented activities that required carrying extra gear and with the nasty weather it made a convenient place to stash extra layers.\n\nThe CPL24 itself performed extraordinarily well. The pack has just the right amount of organization for me. The large panel opening and strategic pocket placement made it easy to load and access gear. The mirror version was the model I was specifically looking for because I sling packs off my right shoulder normally and I'm pretty sure I'm getting too old to learn new habits. The suspension system worked great for me and it carried the gear weight extremely well, keeping it close and tight, not loose and sloppy off the back.\n\nThe V3's new breathable mesh back panel is surprisingly breathable ... like I could place my mouth on it and breathe normally. Sounds weird, but try it. I appreciated the understated appearance of the pack's exterior design and material. It blended into professional environments easily and shed snow and rain admirably while traipsing across town those first two days. As for durability, after being dragged all over the city, shoved into planes, buses and subway cars, tossed around rehearsal spaces, dumped into office corners and taking a tumble or two on the city streets, it looks exactly the same as before the trip. Excellent performance!\n\nAnecdotally, both our outbound and return flights were overbooked and most of our groups’ carry-ons were gate-checked on the return flight. The gate personnel walked right past me wearing the CPL during this process and didn't single me out. I was able to comfortably slip the CPL under the 737 seat in front of me while tucking the smaller Nutsac in a space above some earlier boarding group's carry-on stowed above our row. Yay!\n\nUltimately this one bag attempt was a failure from the start, but it was a fun exercise and a good learning experience. The CPL is certainly not a perfect pack and there are some design changes I wouldn’t mind seeing. However, in its current form it is an ideal pack for me right now. It's great for minimal travel, for toting my gear to and from work and as a casual EDC bag when just banging around town. Very happy with this purchase and I’m looking forward to more adventures with it!\n\nSpecial thanks to all the one baggers posting your thoughts and experiences here. It really helped in bag selection and when figuring out what was important and what could be left behind and made the whole experience easier.

Really appreciating the curved design since it doesn’t require a snap cover handle (as the EG guys intended). I also like how the laptop compartment isn’t over-engineered - I was worried that they’d add a full floating compartment like the CPL series. Lastly, the opening system works great, and makes the bag stand out from its competitors. \n\nHowever, I have two gripes/nitpicks. Firstly (and a very subjective critique), is that I feel like the dimensions could have been slightly more compact. For me personally, I think the bag could be smaller by an inch on each side, and be around 30L. This is just because I don’t think I’ll ever fully pack it out due to weight concerns, given that the bag is also heftier than other duffels. Also, I tend to pack light anyways, but YMMV. \n\nSecondly, the strap is comfortable in terms of padding, and the buckle system works great. However, it’s seatbelt webbing material means that it slides well for crossbody carry, but can slip a bit one-shoulder carry (at least for me). This is in comparison to something like the Tom Bihn Absolute strap, which has a non-slip surface. \n\nAlso, if it helps anyone, I’m using the Tom Bihn Synik 30 small packing cube, which fits nicely into the bottom of this duffel.",

Great bags and the material is, in my opinion at least, awesome. It’s kept the contents dry multiple times in the rain, isn’t too shiny and feels good to the touch. \n\nThe coyote is awesome as a colour, hard to show via photo, but in real life it’s so cool. I am working on selling my V3 CPL24 (standard material), same with my PLC20 and maybe CTB26 (love that bag, but it isn’t getting much use). I might get a new PLC20 in the new fabric and solution dyed, particularly the old fabric has put me off, a dust and hair magnet. Anyway! Thank you all again for your input. Very happy with the bags 👌🏻",

I love the coyote, as I said, it just makes it a little more interesting, but less timeless and less formal. I was always looking for the perfect EDC bag - I tried the PLC20 and the CHZ22 - but it was only when I got this MPL22 that I was properly satisfied! \n\nIn terms of the fabric, I love it, it's not too \"plasticky\", it's naturally pretty weatherproof, it doesn't really make any weird crumpling sounds, and just generally it feels like a really sturdy material. I have an Aer sling in X-Pac and that is definitely, in my opinion, a lower quality material, it is a lot more plasticky and crumples and it just isn't as nice. Because it's a sling, I can deal with it, but yeah, if you compare Ecopak with X-Pac, I definitely think Ecopak comes out in front. \n\nI will also say that you get plenty of organisation with the MPL22, which was important for me as I have ADHD and things just.... \"disappear\" if I don't have enough organisation in a bag. Naturally with the MPL22 you get the top front pocket, which is a great size, the bottom front pocket can fit an insane amount of gear (e.g. right now it has my CAP1 in it, along with a jacket, power bank and Sony XM5 headphones) - with room to spare. \n\nThen internally, a decent opaque pocket and the mesh pocket is roomy. The only downside, but you know all about this with the CHZ22, is that it doesn't have a separate laptop compartment. But even when the bag is pretty full, getting my Macbook Air M2 out at the airport isn't too tricky. Much easier with the CPL24, but that's a bigger bag and relatively different design. I love my CTB26, but it just isn't getting much use. When I need it, I love it, but it isn't an EDC for me. \n\nI would like to get the MPL22 in nylon, perhaps, at some stage, just to mix things up, but I'd have to import it from the US (i.e. it would be pricey, unless I make it to the $225 USD free shipping or however much it is). I'm also considering the MPL30 for one-bag travel, or for when I do multi-day hikes. We'll see.",

I love the CTB26, the issue is just that it's gathering dust and I don't do that much one-bag travel, which I think is where it shines. It's just like... I spent so much on it, as everyone does when they buy a CTB26, and it's hard to let it go haha. \n\nAnyway, irrespective of that, the lineup is great, you're right. MPL22 is perfect for EDC or hiking, CPL24 perfect for when I have a heaver load or when I'm travelling. Do you have any Ecopak bags? Because that's the other thing, I am in love with the material. I don't know how many years it will last, but it feels extremely sturdy. I like nylon too, as long as it's 840d, but yeah, there's something about this Ecopak that I love. \n\nI am also just so happy to *finally* have a bag from EG that isn't fking black. Black is great, timeless, doesn't get dirty (or, at least, you can't see it), professional. But every single bag until the Ecopak... they all had to be black, no questions asked. So coyote is nice to have. And it is a gorgeous colour, it's really hard to photograph it properly, but in real life, it looks amazing. Yes, it might show stains etc more, not being black, but because it's Ecopak, it's so easy to just use some soapy water and it just wipes off so easily, I've done it several times.",

It's less timeless than black, less professional, less intense... but I'm likely going to take the black version to work. \n\nBut honestly, coyote wouldn't be an issue either. I have the black CPL24 in the picture as you will've seen, and I use that as my EDC when I need to \"be formal\", or when I have more gear with me.\n\nBut with the MPL22 - I really can't recommend it enough, if you don't already have one. The pockets are all amazing for organisaton, it's not an issue getting my laptop out when the bag is full, it's comfortable to carry even on 6-7 hour hikes, naturally it has the new back panel, it fits under the seat in front on most planes, and of course, when it's in Ecopak, it's much more resistant to the elements.

The tech sections on some competitor bags (GR1, Concealpack, Able Carry Daily, Synik) seem to consume less of the total volume, but maybe I’m wrong. The main section of the CPL looks a bit shallow, like only maybe 4 inches deep, so a decent amount of volume seems to be in that tech section.",

There are cheaper alternatives out there, but I’ve never tried them and for all I know they could be lesser quality, hence “cheaper”. If anything, I do think it could be $20 or so cheaper considering how simple of a product it is.\n\nBUT, they back their product with a warranty. Feels super slim in the pocket, ridged af, and is minimal just how I prefer my wallet to be. There is a slight learning curve to using it, but once you get used to filing through your cards on the fly at the cash register, you’ll enjoy it.
