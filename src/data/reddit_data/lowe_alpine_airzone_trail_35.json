Very comfortable (even though it weighs in at 2.9kg), tonnes of space for a week away in winter and the thing is bulletproof/strong.\n\nAlso bought the Lowe Alpine AirZone Trail 35L for lightweight weekend trips in the warmer months. Been great.\n\nLowe Alpine is one of those brands, even before RAB bought them out which is reliably good quality. Some people swear by Osprey, but each to their own.",
