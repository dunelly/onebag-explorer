            "body": "Bellroy recently launched the ‘travel lite backpack’ and was in the market for a lightweight 30L backpack, and as I’m heading to Italy tomorrow, I thought this would fit the bill. I haven’t traveled with it yet, but I’ll update you after my trip. Here’s some of what I’ve packed:\n\n1) Here’s the 30L next to a Peak Design tech pouch. It’s filled to the brim with stuff and a chunky-looking boi, which I don’t mind as long as comfort isn’t sacrificed.\n\n2) I love the clamshell opening. I’ve been one-bagging for a decade, and this is my first entry to the clam life, and I’m kicking myself for not going this route earlier. To the top left are socks and undies for five days. Underneath them are three dress shirts (one long sleeve and two pairs of shorts). This would usually go in a packing cube, but there is no need for that now. Let’s see what’s on the right \n\n3) Woah, that’s a lot! A Bellroy sling with cameras, a pair of size 12 sneakers, a packing cube with one pair of pants, two pairs of shorts, two T-shirts, Matador toiletries, and a hat. Oh, and there is an iPad that goes in the back, but here it is anyway. \n\n4) Here in the front, we have a small packing cube with random goodies (sanitizer, lens wipes, asthma inhaler, tea bags, etc.), sunglasses, a pouch with a light jacket, a pair of Sony 1000XM5 headphones, a wallet, and some chocolates. We have to have snacks. \n\n5) Here’s a quick peek into my tech pouch and sling. I personally find the teach pouch overengineered. The regular pouch is good enough for me, but I got it free from work, so why not? It’s fine. In the sling are two cameras and an extra lens.\n\n\nSome other thoughts so far: \n- Let’s talk straps and comfort. I’m a 6-foot husky boi with relatively broad shoulders, and it feels somewhat awkward - both empty and full. The straps are short and narrow. A part of me hopes that it’s something I’ll get used to, but we’ll see. I went from loving everything about the pack to being slightly skeptical - which isn’t a great feeling when it’s a $200 backpack with only a three-year warranty. \n\n- I’m unsure if I’ll attach the tech pouch with a small carabiner or carry the sling separately and throw the tech pouch in the bag. TBD.\n\n- I might dump the light jacket. \n\n- My phone, passport, and AirPods aren’t pictured because I’ll have them in my pocket while in transit. \n\n- What I like about the pack is how flexible it is. What I mean is that I can pack it to the brim with my size 12 shoes and cameras, or you can throw in your espresso machine instead, or not, and keep it super simple. Because it’s essentially one big compartment, you have plenty of flexibility to tailor things to your needs. \n\n- Build quality seems excellent so far. Longevity is mainly how I value bags, so let me return in five years!\n\n\n\nEdit/update 1:\n\n- Comfort: I’ve walked about 14 miles in a span of three days with the pack and it’s been a breeze. Comfort level is significantly better than what I initially expected. Yes, the straps are still too short but fit and comfort is really good. \n\n- weather resistance: I was caught in an extreme downpour today in Milan, so much so that there’s currently flooding happening. Furthermore all trains were cancelled at the station where I was at due to flooding so I had to get to another station by foot. All in all I was out for about 20 minutes and I’m pretty impressed. Some water got through on the vertical seam but nothing significant. The small top compartment however got more water in and my wallet and passport are currently air drying. It wasn’t soaked by any means, but I doubt a small power bank would’ve survived. Needless to say it was nice to find out that while I was completely soaked, all my electronics were safe and sound.

            "body": "Bellroy recently launched the ‘travel lite backpack’ and was in the market for a lightweight 30L backpack, and as I’m heading to Italy tomorrow, I thought this would fit the bill. I haven’t traveled with it yet, but I’ll update you after my trip. Here’s some of what I’ve packed:\n\n1) Here’s the 30L next to a Peak Design tech pouch. It’s filled to the brim with stuff and a chunky-looking boi, which I don’t mind as long as comfort isn’t sacrificed.\n\n2) I love the clamshell opening. I’ve been one-bagging for a decade, and this is my first entry to the clam life, and I’m kicking myself for not going this route earlier. To the top left are socks and undies for five days. Underneath them are three dress shirts (one long sleeve and two pairs of shorts). This would usually go in a packing cube, but there is no need for that now. Let’s see what’s on the right \n\n3) Woah, that’s a lot! A Bellroy sling with cameras, a pair of size 12 sneakers, a packing cube with one pair of pants, two pairs of shorts, two T-shirts, Matador toiletries, and a hat. Oh, and there is an iPad that goes in the back, but here it is anyway. \n\n4) Here in the front, we have a small packing cube with random goodies (sanitizer, lens wipes, asthma inhaler, tea bags, etc.), sunglasses, a pouch with a light jacket, a pair of Sony 1000XM5 headphones, a wallet, and some chocolates. We have to have snacks. \n\n5) Here’s a quick peek into my tech pouch and sling. I personally find the teach pouch overengineered. The regular pouch is good enough for me, but I got it free from work, so why not? It’s fine. In the sling are two cameras and an extra lens.\n\n\nSome other thoughts so far: \n- Let’s talk straps and comfort. I’m a 6-foot husky boi with relatively broad shoulders, and it feels somewhat awkward - both empty and full. The straps are short and narrow. A part of me hopes that it’s something I’ll get used to, but we’ll see. I went from loving everything about the pack to being slightly skeptical - which isn’t a great feeling when it’s a $200 backpack with only a three-year warranty. \n\n- I’m unsure if I’ll attach the tech pouch with a small carabiner or carry the sling separately and throw the tech pouch in the bag. TBD.\n\n- I might dump the light jacket. \n\n- My phone, passport, and AirPods aren’t pictured because I’ll have them in my pocket while in transit. \n\n- What I like about the pack is how flexible it is. What I mean is that I can pack it to the brim with my size 12 shoes and cameras, or you can throw in your espresso machine instead, or not, and keep it super simple. Because it’s essentially one big compartment, you have plenty of flexibility to tailor things to your needs. \n\n- Build quality seems excellent so far. Longevity is mainly how I value bags, so let me return in five years!\n\n\n\nEdit/update 1:\n\n- Comfort: I’ve walked about 14 miles in a span of three days with the pack and it’s been a breeze. Comfort level is significantly better than what I initially expected. Yes, the straps are still too short but fit and comfort is really good. \n\n- weather resistance: I was caught in an extreme downpour today in Milan, so much so that there’s currently flooding happening. Furthermore all trains were cancelled at the station where I was at due to flooding so I had to get to another station by foot. All in all I was out for about 20 minutes and I’m pretty impressed. Some water got through on the vertical seam but nothing significant. The small top compartment however got more water in and my wallet and passport are currently air drying. It wasn’t soaked by any means, but I doubt a small power bank would’ve survived. Needless to say it was nice to find out that while I was completely soaked, all my electronics were safe and sound.

            "body": "Bellroy recently launched the ‘travel lite backpack’ and was in the market for a lightweight 30L backpack, and as I’m heading to Italy tomorrow, I thought this would fit the bill. I haven’t traveled with it yet, but I’ll update you after my trip. Here’s some of what I’ve packed:\n\n1) Here’s the 30L next to a Peak Design tech pouch. It’s filled to the brim with stuff and a chunky-looking boi, which I don’t mind as long as comfort isn’t sacrificed.\n\n2) I love the clamshell opening. I’ve been one-bagging for a decade, and this is my first entry to the clam life, and I’m kicking myself for not going this route earlier. To the top left are socks and undies for five days. Underneath them are three dress shirts (one long sleeve and two pairs of shorts). This would usually go in a packing cube, but there is no need for that now. Let’s see what’s on the right \n\n3) Woah, that’s a lot! A Bellroy sling with cameras, a pair of size 12 sneakers, a packing cube with one pair of pants, two pairs of shorts, two T-shirts, Matador toiletries, and a hat. Oh, and there is an iPad that goes in the back, but here it is anyway. \n\n4) Here in the front, we have a small packing cube with random goodies (sanitizer, lens wipes, asthma inhaler, tea bags, etc.), sunglasses, a pouch with a light jacket, a pair of Sony 1000XM5 headphones, a wallet, and some chocolates. We have to have snacks. \n\n5) Here’s a quick peek into my tech pouch and sling. I personally find the teach pouch overengineered. The regular pouch is good enough for me, but I got it free from work, so why not? It’s fine. In the sling are two cameras and an extra lens.\n\n\nSome other thoughts so far: \n- Let’s talk straps and comfort. I’m a 6-foot husky boi with relatively broad shoulders, and it feels somewhat awkward - both empty and full. The straps are short and narrow. A part of me hopes that it’s something I’ll get used to, but we’ll see. I went from loving everything about the pack to being slightly skeptical - which isn’t a great feeling when it’s a $200 backpack with only a three-year warranty. \n\n- I’m unsure if I’ll attach the tech pouch with a small carabiner or carry the sling separately and throw the tech pouch in the bag. TBD.\n\n- I might dump the light jacket. \n\n- My phone, passport, and AirPods aren’t pictured because I’ll have them in my pocket while in transit. \n\n- What I like about the pack is how flexible it is. What I mean is that I can pack it to the brim with my size 12 shoes and cameras, or you can throw in your espresso machine instead, or not, and keep it super simple. Because it’s essentially one big compartment, you have plenty of flexibility to tailor things to your needs. \n\n- Build quality seems excellent so far. Longevity is mainly how I value bags, so let me return in five years!\n\n\n\nEdit/update 1:\n\n- Comfort: I’ve walked about 14 miles in a span of three days with the pack and it’s been a breeze. Comfort level is significantly better than what I initially expected. Yes, the straps are still too short but fit and comfort is really good. \n\n- weather resistance: I was caught in an extreme downpour today in Milan, so much so that there’s currently flooding happening.

        "selftext": "For the past year or so I have used a Zpacks bagger 25 ultra.I loved this pack because of the weight (only 310g). However that pack is not always the best in use... Not a lot of organization/access, very loud and crinkly and no place to really put a laptop which I often have to travel with. \n\nAfter purchasing a Bellroy lite sling (which is excellent) I recently saw Bellroy released the travel pack lite 30l and at sub 1kg with much more organization it intrigued me so I picked one up for my upcoming 6 month trip through Asia.\n\nIn my test pack I think I am going to really love this bag. A couple of things stand out to me. \n\n- Each and every pocket has its own dimension so when you use one space it doesn't eat into the other space. The fabric on the front pockets also has some stretchto it which is nice. \n\n- The fabric is also nice and soft and quiet. \n\n- The organization is also well thought out and just enough. To be honest it is basically a smaller cotopaxi allpa 35 with lighter materials and a extra pocket on the front. I always liked the layout of the allpa but not the materials or the weight. \n\n- I really like the zippers and zipper pulls. \n\n- The straps are much better than I thought they would be. \n\n- This thing can fit a lot of stuff. The load out in the pictures is more than I plan on taking but I wanted to see how much I could fit. \n\nThe one obvious miss is the lack of a water bottle holder. \n\nI am looking forward to running this bag through its paces over the next few months. \n\n",

For those wondering, Bellroy has been answering concerns about the lack of water bottle pocket on this bag over on their YouTube video that a version of this bag, or something similar, will come out in Spring of 2025 with one.\n\nAnyways, the bag is stunning, especially in the clay colorway. I can't wait to pick one up. I have a Bellroy Lite Duffel, and their Lite Pouches—the materials are so great.\n\nLooking forward to hearing post-trip reports, OP! How is the comfort?

The 30L seems a good size with decent amount of storage. Laptop is protected by a stiff plate between it and the backpack straps. Backpack straps are nicely padded, nuch nore robust than their Lite ready packs.\n\nThe main compartment and top pocket zippers do not having locking loops on them, but the lower pocket and thr laptop pocket have a fanncy zipper where it can only be opened if the zipper is lifted up.\n\nThere's also an attachment loop top right of the bag, that lines with anothet loop bottom right of the bag, which would seem suggest a shoilder strap for duffel carry, but Bellroy doesn't supply such a strap.\n",

        "selftext": "I’m looking for a 25L-30L backpack that I can use for years to come, but especially on my upcoming first solo trip to the UK! I’m not too keen on bright colors or overly athletic/outdoorsy looking bags for this purchase. I’d prefer a sleek design with neutral colors since I may use this for work travel as well as personal. I’d prefer a clamshell opening, laptop compartment not required. \n\nI’ve looked through many recommendations from other posts in this sub and have narrowed it down (I think) to the Bellroy Lite Travel Pack and the Away Convertible Backpack 25L. Has anyone tried these out and have any feedback to share? \n\nWhile I like the features on the Osprey Daylite 26+6, the black is out of stock and I personally don’t want a bag that’s bright and colorful. I feel similarly towards the Cotopaxi Allpa 28.\n\nAm I missing any others out there that are a bit more sleek and could be used for professional travel? Looking to spend under $250!\n",

I’m not too keen on bright colors or overly athletic/outdoorsy looking bags for this purchase. I’d prefer a sleek design with neutral colors since I may use this for work travel as well as personal. I’d prefer a clamshell opening, laptop compartment not required. \n\nI’ve looked through many recommendations from other posts in this sub and have narrowed it down (I think) to the Bellroy Lite Travel Pack and the Away Convertible Backpack 25L. Has anyone tried these out and have any feedback to share? \n\nWhile I like the features on the Osprey Daylite 26+6, the black is out of stock and I personally don’t want a bag that’s bright and colorful. I feel similarly towards the Cotopaxi Allpa 28.\n\nAm I missing any others out there that are a bit more sleek and could be used for professional travel? Looking to spend under $250!\n",

I made a post last year prior to going to Italy for two weeks, and I have since been on several other trips with the bag. The really short version is that I ended up selling it —It was so close to being the perfect bag, but those straps were unbearable.\n\nI wrote a lengthy review on my Substack, so feel free to check it out if you want the long version. I’m also very new to the Substack platform, so if someone else is on, let’s connect! I'm happy to answer any questions about the bag :) ",

        "selftext": "This is my current work and personal setup: I have a Bellroy Classic backpack in lunar that holds water, tech kit, journal, personal items, and then I also include a Bellroy Lite sling (color is called “copper”). The green and gray small pouch is by the Doughbut brand—bought that one on JetPens—and it contains work items like my badge and work keys. I carry everything in my backpack into my clinic and office areas, then if I’m lucky with a lunch break, I take the sling with me to grab coffee or go on a quick walk. That allows me to carry my badge, keys, AirPods, phone, and sometimes a book with me without the “bigness” of the backpack for what’s usually a pretty quick jaunt outside. On the weekends, that little green pouch gets tucked away, and I use the backpack for daily carry. I have been LOVING this setup so far!!!",
