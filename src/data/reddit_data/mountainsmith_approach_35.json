I tend to use the HM if got the wife and kids with me as it normally means that I need to take more crap!

Slightly more fiddly to access than when compared to HM.\n- The Crazy Black fabric is absolutely killer.

Slightly more fiddly to access than when compared to HM.\n- The Crazy Black fabric is absolutely killer.

Sorry if accidently added commentary twice.\n\nQuick comparison between Hip Monkey (v1 I think) and Full Moon.\n\nNote that both capable of being synched and expanded slightly using webbing at sides. This post based upon both being fully synched. Added ITW Web Dominators to do this.\n\nHip Monkey - Foliage cw. Duraflex buckle replaced with Austrialpin Cobra. ITE Web dominators and Grimloc added.\n\nFull Moon - Japan exclusive ‘Crazy Black’ cw, which is comprised of various fabrics. Duraflex buckle replaced with iTW Cobra. ITW Web dominators and Grimloc added.\n\nBack padding on each is large and comfortable. Wide strap on each, they both carry loads well. \n\nFront pocket on both normally used to hold iphone 12 pro plus key case or a small orbitgear pouch with medical pack.\n\nTo show capacity, used Camelbak 750ml and Ironheart IHSH-75 denim shirt in XL. Remember this is with them fully synched, so lowest volume.\n\nFew key points -\n\n- Zip access on both is different. HM has more of a lid style opening, whilst FM the Zip runs straight over the top. I would say that the HM configuration allows you to cram more stuff in.\n\n- HM certainly holds more. I could have fitted a few more bits in there. I tend to use the HM if got the wife and kids with me as it normally means that I need to take more crap! If I am on my own or we are just popping out and don’t need to take snacks etc, then normally go for the FM.\n- The HM is slightly more comfortable when fully loaded, as the ‘wing’ attaching the strap to main body of bag is bigger.\n- The loop that attach grimloc too (which I use to secure a facemask) is configured differently on the FM. Slightly more fiddly to access than when compared to HM.\n- The Crazy Black fabric is absolutely killer. A real mash-up of textures that looks quite boring in product pics but is really unique in the flesh.",

            "body": "I camped out in Devils Playground in the heart of the Mojave before taking on Sands Benchmark. It's about as far as you can get from anything, at least in this area. From Kelbaker Road, it's about a one hour drive on 4wd type road (rocks, sand, rutting, etc.) to where I camped. I've approached this area from the north and the south (Ludlow, CA). This northern approach is definitely the easier way.\n\nI found an awesome camp just below a dune. Following the main road in, you'll see a turn off heading to the left. It's very faint but followable. If you don't mind the trains (I  heard a couple before bed, and I'm sure they ran during the night, but I slept through them) then it's a great spot, with some of the most expansive views of the interior Mojave that I've ever experienced.  \nThis left me less than 20 minutes of easy though still 4wd driving to get to the trail head in the morning (I scouted it out before setting up camp).\n\nAfter parking along the north side of the tracks, you have to cross the tracks and then spend nearly a mile crossing Kelso wash. Recent rains had firmed up the terrain so it actually wasn't too bad. After passing a small subsidiary bump/ridge, I entered a drainage. The hike was supposed to be up a clearly defined wash, or at least one that shows up on maps. It goes, but the wash is braided down below, and up higher expect plenty of boulder hopping and scrambly bits with some light class 3 mixed in. It gets pretty steep toward the top, so I looked for an alternate way down. In the end it probably would have been best to just go back down the way I came up.\n\nViews from the top were sadly not great due to all the clouds from the rains.\n\nTotal stats: just under 11 miles, 2,400' gain, and a smidge under 5 hours.",

Would camp SW of the end of Rasor, at the base of a hill with one steep couloir filled with fine white sand that blew in and accumulated. The bigger bikes and buggies would run at it full speed, and ride all the way to the top, when they could. Usually take a long ride on the bikes down to Afton Canyon, where there was an old-timey hand pump water spigot for cooling off, cleaning up. Nighttime we’d get in sand rails and ride to and on the dunes. Have gone back many times since closed to OHV to explore in a far less destructive manner.\n\nThe place never leaves you.

From Kelbaker Road, it's about a one hour drive on 4wd type road (rocks, sand, rutting, etc.) to where I camped. I've approached this area from the north and the south (Ludlow, CA). This northern approach is definitely the easier way.\n\nI found an awesome camp just below a dune. Following the main road in, you'll see a turn off heading to the left. It's very faint but followable. If you don't mind the trains (I  heard a couple before bed, and I'm sure they ran during the night, but I slept through them) then it's a great spot, with some of the most expansive views of the interior Mojave that I've ever experienced.  \nThis left me less than 20 minutes of easy though still 4wd driving to get to the trail head in the morning (I scouted it out before setting up camp).\n\nAfter parking along the north side of the tracks, you have to cross the tracks and then spend nearly a mile crossing Kelso wash. Recent rains had firmed up the terrain so it actually wasn't too bad. After passing a small subsidiary bump/ridge, I entered a drainage. The hike was supposed to be up a clearly defined wash, or at least one that shows up on maps. It goes, but the wash is braided down below, and up higher expect plenty of boulder hopping and scrambly bits with some light class 3 mixed in. It gets pretty steep toward the top, so I looked for an alternate way down. In the end it probably would have been best to just go back down the way I came up.\n\nViews from the top were sadly not great due to all the clouds from the rains.\n\nTotal stats: just under 11 miles, 2,400' gain, and a smidge under 5 hours.",

From Kelbaker Road, it's about a one hour drive on 4wd type road (rocks, sand, rutting, etc.) to where I camped. I've approached this area from the north and the south (Ludlow, CA). This northern approach is definitely the easier way.\n\nI found an awesome camp just below a dune. Following the main road in, you'll see a turn off heading to the left. It's very faint but followable. If you don't mind the trains (I  heard a couple before bed, and I'm sure they ran during the night, but I slept through them) then it's a great spot, with some of the most expansive views of the interior Mojave that I've ever experienced.  \nThis left me less than 20 minutes of easy though still 4wd driving to get to the trail head in the morning (I scouted it out before setting up camp).\n\nAfter parking along the north side of the tracks, you have to cross the tracks and then spend nearly a mile crossing Kelso wash. Recent rains had firmed up the terrain so it actually wasn't too bad. After passing a small subsidiary bump/ridge, I entered a drainage. The hike was supposed to be up a clearly defined wash, or at least one that shows up on maps. It goes, but the wash is braided down below, and up higher expect plenty of boulder hopping and scrambly bits with some light class 3 mixed in. It gets pretty steep toward the top, so I looked for an alternate way down. In the end it probably would have been best to just go back down the way I came up.\n\nViews from the top were sadly not great due to all the clouds from the rains.\n\nTotal stats: just under 11 miles, 2,400' gain, and a smidge under 5 hours.",

From Kelbaker Road, it's about a one hour drive on 4wd type road (rocks, sand, rutting, etc.) to where I camped. I've approached this area from the north and the south (Ludlow, CA). This northern approach is definitely the easier way.\n\nI found an awesome camp just below a dune. Following the main road in, you'll see a turn off heading to the left. It's very faint but followable. If you don't mind the trains (I  heard a couple before bed, and I'm sure they ran during the night, but I slept through them) then it's a great spot, with some of the most expansive views of the interior Mojave that I've ever experienced.  \nThis left me less than 20 minutes of easy though still 4wd driving to get to the trail head in the morning (I scouted it out before setting up camp).\n\nAfter parking along the north side of the tracks, you have to cross the tracks and then spend nearly a mile crossing Kelso wash. Recent rains had firmed up the terrain so it actually wasn't too bad. After passing a small subsidiary bump/ridge, I entered a drainage. The hike was supposed to be up a clearly defined wash, or at least one that shows up on maps. It goes, but the wash is braided down below, and up higher expect plenty of boulder hopping and scrambly bits with some light class 3 mixed in. It gets pretty steep toward the top, so I looked for an alternate way down. In the end it probably would have been best to just go back down the way I came up.\n\nViews from the top were sadly not great due to all the clouds from the rains.\n\nTotal stats: just under 11 miles, 2,400' gain, and a smidge under 5 hours.",

        "selftext": "**Hi** r/onebag**!** \n\n**I recently returned from a 10-week trip to Europe. This is everything I carried.** \n\n[ This is everything I carry. One week or three months, doesn’t matter!  ](https://preview.redd.it/3zybzrpnlhdc1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9994a2006e58b287e134f3b5465c88b1030b41)\n\n*I posted my travel gear packing list to* [*my website*](https://loganletsgo.com/)*. I wasn't able to share the link for it on this sub, so I'm creating this post here.* \n\n*I copied this from my post, so apologies if the formatting is a little weird. I tried my best to clean it up.* \n\n[Read my post about packing light](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/improve-your-travels-by-packing-light) if the concept is new to you, or if you don’t believe it’s possible. \n\nI will update [this page](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/my-travel-gear) regularly, and date it.   \nI need to add more photos, so check in later for that.   \nAll gear is current as of January 2024. \n\nI don’t spend a ton of money on gear and clothes, because I don’t want to be crushed if I lost my pack. I put too many hours of research, trial and error into these things, but the actual investment isn’t crazy. Everything can be easily replaced. \n\n**Pack**  \nI use a 20L backpack, [a brilliant design by Nashville Pack](https://nashvillepack.com/collections/made-to-order-packs/products/made-to-order-bridge-pack-1). It's absolutely perfect. \n\nI met these guys at Trail Days, an annual event for Appalachian Trail thru hikers. I’ve only hiked sections of the AT, but the people at Nashville Pack are [triple crowners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking), having completed all three major thru hiking trails in the USA (AT, CDT, PCT) - multiple times. This pack stood that test. \n\nWhen I saw it, I knew it was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a bulletproof roll-top pack, with plenty extra stuff sack storage on the exterior. The best feature of this pack is the shoulder straps that gently form to your body, rather than foam that cuts into your shoulders like most packs have. This pack has no zippers. By far the most expensive piece of travel gear I have (not counting my phone). Worth every penny. \n\n**Down jacket**  \nThe puffy. A crucial piece of warm weather gear for the lightweight traveler. [Decathlon makes an elite down jacket](https://www.decathlon.com/collections/mens-down-jackets/products/forclaz-mt100-hooded-down-puffer-jacket-167571?) for a price tag that doesn't make me sick. I've worn this jacket in the backcountry, traveled through Europe with it, and beaten it up for daily use back home. You won't find a better puffy for that price. The warmth-to-weight ratio is outstanding. A down jacket is a must-have. I prefer one with a hood and pockets, but you can find some without those.  \n\n**Rain jacket**  \nI refuse to pay top dollar for an ultralight rain shell. This nearly weightless piece of plastic shouldn't cost more than dinner. That's why I have a [budget-friendly frogg toggs](https://www.froggtoggs.com/frogg-toggsr-ultra-lite-rain-jacket-4748).  This thing has kept me dry. It does its job. But you do pay for what  you get. It has no pockets, it's not stylish, and it's not extremely  durable. I prefer the oversized baggy build of this jacket, because I can wear layers underneath and still have plenty of wiggle room. \n\n**Hoody/fleece**   \nIf I was to lose my pack, I must admit that I'd be devastated to lose my Melanzana fleece hoody. This thing has traveled the world with me, kept me cozy in airplanes and on mountaintops. We've had a great run together, going on strong for almost six years now. In my rare selfies, I'm probably wearing the melly. I'll never leave home without a trusty mid-layer. \n\n**Long-sleeve button-ups**  \nI bring two. One is colorful, thin and breathable for warm weather. The other is black and slightly thicker material. Both can be worn for a night out. It's nice to have two. When one needs a wash, I can wear the other one. No special brand - both of these were thrift store finds. \n\n**T-shirts**  \nOn my latest trip I carried three t-shirts. One black, one blue-gray, one mustard-brown. All three can be worn for a workout, or for casual. It's a t-shirt, I don't overthink it. Sometimes I'll also bring a short-sleeve collared shirt. This is a luxury item for me. Not necessary. \n\nIf you've read a hundred travel blogs (like I have), you've heard the benefits of wool preached again and again. Read my section on socks for more info about wool. I haven't yet made the switch to wool shirts for travel. Cotton’s downside is it will need to be washed far more often than wool. There's no doubt about that. I’m sure I’ll make the switch soon enough. \n\n**Shorts**  \nI bring two pairs on warm-weather trips. [Anthem Athletics shorts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VZBSK1R/ref=dp_iou_view_item?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1) with zipper pockets, all black. I've been wearing these shorts for workouts for years. The best I've ever had. I love the deep zipper pockets, keeping my stuff secure. \n\nThe other pair is a 5-inch athletic fit all-day style shorts. These are versatile, good for any occasion. I can wear them during active exploration, or pair with a button-up for a clean look. It has a hidden zipper pocket too, where I keep my wallet and locker key. \n\nI prefer 5-inch shorts. I'm a short man (and I have nice legs). Short shorts is a better look for me than longer shorts that hover around the knees. \n\n**Pants**  \nThis decision depends on the climate. Knowing I'd start my trip in Portugal and Spain during warmer months, I brought one pair of pants. Thin nylon hiking pants from Kuhl that also look good enough to wear with a button-up. These served me well for a month. \n\nWhen I flew  from Barcelona to Budapest, I knew I'd need a pair of jeans for the  colder weather. At a thrift store I snagged a pair of black jeans, a  canvas coat and a blue beanie for 23 Euro. \n\nWhatever I might need,  I can always find in my destinations. I don't pack winter clothes  (besides a puffy and hoody) when I won't be in winter climates for the  first few weeks of my trip. I'll just buy what I need in my new cold  environment. There's no sense in lugging around clothes I'll never wear  for weeks at a time. \n\n**Undies**  \nI carry four pairs. They're easy to wash, and dry overnight. [David Archy](https://davidarchy.com/)  is the most comfortable I've ever had. I've been wearing them for  years. They're made from a bamboo material. Incredibly soft and  breathable. Downside, they don't dry quickly - faster than cotton, but  not as fast as wool. I haven't made the switch to wool just yet, because  I love them so much. \n\n**Socks**  \nIf  you don't have wool socks, you don't know what you're missing. Wool  keeps you warm when it's cold, and keeps you cool when it's hot. Wool  dries quickly. Wool is naturally anti-odor, anti-bacterial. Throw away  all of your cotton socks and replace them with wool. I can wear a single  pair for two or three days before needing to switch to a clean pair. \n\nI  bring four pairs. I prefer a thinner lightweight over the thicker  midweight hiking sock. I wear only crew socks, which goes above the  ankle. Black socks, black shoes. That's my thing! Darn Tough makes [the best socks](https://darntough.com/products/mens-merino-wool-light-hiker-micro-crew-lightweight-hiking-socks) I’ve ever found. \n\n**Shoes**  \nI  bring one pair of shoes when I travel. The shoes on my feet. I don't  have a need for sandals or boots or a nice pair of dress shoes. The  weight and space savings of having no shoes in my pack is enormous.  Shoes are bulky, heavy, annoying to pack. Avoid this at all costs if you  can. \n\nOn my latest trip I wore the exact same pair of  shoes for 72 days straight. They didn't smell great during my final  week, but they kept my feet safe and happy. Even if I was convinced I  needed a second pair of shoes, I’d do everything in my power to persuade  myself to bring only one pair. \n\nI wear barefoot/minimalist shoes.  They have no cushioned sole, which allows my feet to feel the texture  of the ground, sending that constant signal of information to my brain.  They have a wider toe box, which allows my toes to spread out and party.  \n\nMy favorite shoes of all time are the [Vivobarefoot Primus](https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/primus-trail-ii-fg-mens-ss22)  trail runners, all black. My every day shoes. I'm on my fourth pair.  They can almost double as sandals. When I go to the beach, I can put  them on with wet and sandy feet, and easily clean out the sand, and  they'll dry quickly. \n\nAll black socks and shoes can pair  with anything, and they're far less flashy than bright and colorful  running shoes. I can get away with wearing these to a nice dinner. \n\nEven  if that’s not true, it doesn’t matter. As a lightweight traveler, you  have stop caring what anyone thinks about how you dress. Just be  respectful of religious places that have a dress code. \n\n**Belt**  \nThis  decision is easy. I pack my lightest weight belt. I weigh the few belts  I own and pick the lightest one. My leather belt looks good, but it's  heavy. Nobody will notice or care about the style of belt I wear. Always  go light! \n\n**Hats**  \nA standard  snapback cap is non-negotiable for me. When the sun is out, I'm wearing a  hat. Lately I've been really digging this black nylon hat my sister got  me for my birthday. Easy to wash and dries quickly. But most  importantly, it protects my face from sunburns, and it keeps the hair  out of my face on windy days. \n\nI'll bring a beanie only if  it will be cold in my destination. Or just buy one there. Beanies might  be the most common item you'll find in stores in cold climates. Tourist  shops sell them by the thousands. Who doesn't want a big  brightly-colored beanie that says SLOVAKIA in all caps? \n\n**Buff**  \nThis amazing piece of fabric doubles  as a scarf and an eye mask for sleep. Your neck or ears are cold? The  buff can handle that. Sunlight waking you up too early? Buff has you  covered. I found mine on sale at REI years ago. Outdoor Research brand.  It's black, wool and has a few holes. I'll rock this thing til it dies.  The buff has many uses! Everyone should have a wool buff. \n\n**Bandana**  \nRemember  what I said about the common appearance of my melly hoody in selfies?  Warm weather selfies will often feature the appearance of a bandana  around my neck. Lately I've been carrying a red one, but the color will  change from time to time. The bandana keeps my neck protected from the  sun. It adds color to my often-black wardrobe. It can clean the sweat  off my face or the dirt off my hands. It can wipe up coffee spills on a  train. Another versatile travel item. \n\n**Fanny pack**  \nI  bought this specific hip-belt pack (made by Waymark Gear Co.) because it can fit my Kindle and bluetooth keyboard. It's an odd shape compared to most packs, which makes it ideal for awkward rectangular-shaped items. I'll bring it on a  run to hold my phone, wallet, snacks and locker key so they're not  bouncing around in my pockets. \n\nThe \"man purse\" is common  in Europe. I don't understand what exactly all these men need to be  carrying around at all times. No judgement, I'm just curious. The fanny  pack (worn cross-body) is trending right now, so maybe fashion explains  this. It's rare that I have a need for it, but it can definitely be  handy on occasion. \n\n**Phone**  \nArguably the most important piece of travel gear (besides the obvious passport). I have the [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://swappa.com/buy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold4-5g).  This phone unfolds to reveal a larger screen similar to a tablet. It  also has a standard front screen, which is slightly narrower than a  regular phone. \n\nI'll likely never make the switch back to a  regular phone, I love it so much. The Fold is here to stay. Internet  browsing, reading articles and books, looking at my travel photos,  searching on Google Maps - everything is better on the big screen. Since  it's two phones, the battery lasts twice as long. I can go a full 24  hours on one charge, sometimes longer. \n\nI buy sim cards in destinations, or snag an eSIM online. I’ll write a separate post about this. \n\n**Books**  \nOn  my latest trip, I brought my Kindle. I love my eReader, but I won't  carry it on a trip again. I find myself using my phone to read books  more often than the Kindle when I travel. Phone is always in my pocket,  so books are always accessible. The Kindle will continue to be my go-to  reader at home. It's rare for me to travel with paper books. I can't  justify the weight when I have 50 books on my Kindle and phone. \n\n**Earbuds**  \n[Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile-audio/galaxy-buds2-pro/).  High quality headphones are new for me. I've had these for half a year  now, and I finally understand the hype of earbuds. Tiny, can fit in my  pocket, virtually weightless, amazing audio quality, good enough noise  cancelling. \n\nThe only downside is buds can be easy to  misplace. I lost an earbud on a flight. When our plane landed, the kind  woman behind me found it under her seat. I got lucky! \n\n**Keyboard**  \nMicrosoft  makes a bluetooth keyboard that is foldable, lightweight and portable. I  pair this with my phone to create a \"mini laptop\" for writing. I unfold  my phone and unfold the keyboard, and in seconds I can write  comfortably. Not as good as a real laptop, but it works. And saves me a  few pounds, which is huge. \n\n**Toiletries**  \nNo need to deep dive on exactly what I carry, but I will note a few things. My beard trimmer is [designed for pets](https://www.amazon.com/WAHL-Professional-Animal-Trimmer-9961-2881/dp/B0002H3RZQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=306VEOI7XO7UU&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ae1RPpYjpwH7oJGHTv8sRbsxpeHLX2_LeS0SqcfRn6tbqdMVk_4or8clab_-iUIpkjLkeyXiolFF94_5SBaxr22Wj6l88-i-Ypsla_NTYjjEg78tDMCRD7zaivSbUCxtPB7Eq5n9jPa0pgktzDskCj1uBis0xaTI_n2RzdXY8pqJysvHCL81NAgWULpGnH87zHJtq1URR0oX7AiE75T-nzEHm22Jzf60CdNHyJyymZo.mWZLKRB61FqpHKq9tGiMuIUQD_PCvyo32eqSzP-npNY&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=wahl+9966&amp;qid=1705409130&amp;sprefix=wahl+9966%2Caps%2C163&amp;sr=8-1).  It’s tiny, and powered by a single battery, which allows me to avoid  carrying an additional charger. I tossed my other trimmers at home in  favor of this one. [Another good option](https://www.amazon.com/Wahl-Professional-Animal-Grooming-9861-900/dp/B00MNMDO3S/ref=sr_1_7?crid=Q1OD6H2I6UUP&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Nlo9EwAhceEZr6_5CvUv84HAZVy1s7E70zBAyGEh8UIrb8u74Qya7oNxlCBr8397K0ndSFa-aPuzgEtoHbbbZB3djwd7VJVz13eF_xMdzXf0qZ5cYOiJ3B673qmaGlRMfapsYVga4mfE595mP9HUBm6_ERnAsPnIU2QtqsH7_kcpTCXKJ3YNjraclcUJAYTVVgPfk4mfWr3S90Mz0B1ZSt6QiaDJaopBkYcCtan5868.7Ih6o6UaJCJF3E1aMOENciNXfJuQRdKJaazPA5YLOXs&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=wahl%2Banimal%2Btrimmer&amp;qid=1705409022&amp;sprefix=wahl%2Banimal%2Btrimme%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-7&amp;th=1). \n\nA shampoo soap bar is non-negotiable for me. I always carry one. I use [this amazing little Matador pouch](https://www.matadorequipment.com/collections/toiletry-items-collection/products/flatpak-soap-bar-case) to keep it dry, clean and separate from everything else. I don’t know how they do it, but the dry-through tech really works. \n\nMy hair brush is lightweight, and it’s undefeated. [This thing](https://www.tangleteezer.com/us/shop/detangling/thick-curly/salsa-red/) backs down to no tangle. \n\n**Towel**  \nI  love my little travel towel. Maybe the most useful travel item I own.  Some hostels don’t provide towels, or charge a fee for use. The fee is  usually insignificant, but why pay for a towel when I can bring one that  is nearly weightless, packs down smaller than a candy bar and dries  insanely fast? Soak with warm water and soap, rinse, and it’s clean in  an instant. I like the loop for easy hang-dry. Made by PackTowl ([hand size](https://www.packtowl.com/shop/towels/ultralite-towel/11124.html), 16 x 36 in). \n\nI  also have a tiny rag that must be military-grade, because it’s the most  astounding thing I own, it probably costs pennies to make and I got it  for free. It comes prepackaged in a little cube, add water and it  expands. It weighs nothing, dries in minutes, and it’s durable and easy  to clean. Not a crucial piece of gear, but nice to have handy. \n\n**Ear plugs**  \nThe  best sleep system, especially for hostels, is an eye mask and ear  plugs. It blows my mind that some travelers might dismiss this. The best  ear plugs [are silicone, not foam](https://www.amazon.com/Macks-Pillow-Soft-Silicone-Earplugs/dp/B07G1MWHNR). They won’t fall out in the middle of the night, and they block out more noise. \n\n**Cork massage ball**  \nMade by [Rawlogy](https://www.garagegrowngear.com/collections/rawlogy). It keeps my feet happy after tons of daily walking. \n\n**Charger**  \n[Anker 30W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09J4XRSZJ/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) phone charger with a 6-foot cable, with an extra tiny cable for the folding keyboard and LED light. \n\n**Travel adapter**  \n[Mogics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LMKSM92/?coliid=IUXOJZ0E48UST&amp;colid=38ZLIIF0OF1IZ&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it#) international power adapter. Incredibly tiny and lightweight. It has worked in all different outlet types I've tried. \n\n**Mini LED light**  \nA  gift from my dad. This little thing has a built in magnet. It comes in  handy in hostels at night or early mornings when I need a bit of light,  but don't want to use my phone flashlight. I wouldn't bring this if it  wasn't nearly weightless. \n\n**Heroclip**  \n[The Heroclip Mini](https://www.gearaid.com/products/heroclip-mini)  is a unique little tool. The basic function, a carabiner. The second  function, an additional hook with a rubber tip that enables you to hang  over the top of a door, ledge, counter. Comes in handy in bathrooms when  the hooks are missing or broken, and I need to hang my pack or jacket  off the floor. \n\n**Water bottle**  \nI’d  like to avoid drinking out of plastic, but for travel it’s too  convenient. The weight of a metal bottle is outrageous, and an [ultralight titanium bottle](https://www.snowpeak.com/products/ti-aurora-bottle)  is too expensive for me to risk losing. One liter of water by itself  weighs 1kg or 2.2 pounds. Adding a full pound with a metal bottle makes  no sense to me when plastic weighs only a few grams. \n\nIn  hot weather, I’ll bring a 1 liter bottle. I tie paracord on the  bottleneck for easy carry. In cooler temps, I’ll carry a smaller one  (550 to 700ml). I try to avoid buying water bottles. It’s a fun game for  me to see how long I can make one bottle last. I refill where it’s  convenient. Water fountains, tap water when it’s safe, asking restaurant  staff to fill my bottle. \n\n**Passport**  \nI  don't use a travel belt, or have some crazy system of securing my  passport. I just treat it like I would with any other valuable item,  like my phone or wallet. Be careful with it, lock it up when necessary. \n\n**Lock**  \nI  always take advantage of lockers at hostels. I never leave my pack  sitting out in the room when I'm not there. I'll leave some clothes  hanging around, leave the phone charger plugged in, but never my  important belongings. \n\nI prefer a lock with a key, rather  than a combination. Fussing with a combo in the dark is no fun. Key is  easy, and I don't lose a key. If you tend to lose things, then combo  might be better. \n\n**Organization system**  \nTravelers  often make two mistakes - not having a storage system at all, or using  too many packing cubes made from heavy material. \n\nHere’s my system:   \n16L [Granite Gear zipp sack](https://www.granitegear.com/zippsack.html) for all my clothes  \nDrawstring sack for socks &amp; undies (fits inside the clothes sack)   \nBasic toiletries bag  \nSmall pouch for all tiny things (lock, chargers, extra cash, backup credit cards, sim cards, etc.)  \nZiploc plastic baggie for snacks  \nPlastic bag with holes for dirty laundry (thanks, Marriott)\n\nItems that are stored loose inside my pack - puffy, melly, fanny pack.  \nItems that are stored loose outside my pack - hat, rain jacket, bandana, water bottle.   \nEverything else has a cozy home. \n\nThese sacks and pouches are all extremely lightweight items. The minimal  additional weight is worth it for ease of packing and unpacking.  Organization is so important! \n\nCarry less, eliminate stress and go farther! \n\n[my post about packing light mindset, philosophy, etc.](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/improve-your-travels-by-packing-light)\n\n[*Credit to Tynan*](https://tynan.com/gear2023/) *for inspiring this post, and for three items that I would’ve never found myself - my phone, travel adapter and beard trimmer.* ",

How did you handle laundry, did you hand wash it in the hostels or take it to a laundrette, and how often did you do this?\n2. How did you deal with a rather limited wardrobe? Was it all pretty informal or did you need to dress up at times?\n3. How did you find the barefoot shoes for long walks and city travel?\n4. Did you buy souveniers, and if so how did you manage those given the limited bag size?\n5. Did you have any security issues as a result of travelling so light e.g. airport security or at hostels?\n6.

                "body": "Hey thanks!   \nThe long weekend packing mentality really works. What you carry for a long weekend can last you for months, aside from some minor clothing adjustments depending on if you change climates. It really is that simple! \n\n1. I only used local laundromats, just whatever was near to my hostel and had a change machine. Some places accepted tap to pay or credit cards. They were ALL really nice. Never had an issue. \n\n2. Definitely informal. I had a nicer long sleeve button down that I'd wear with the Kuhl pants in warm weather, and then later black jeans in colder weather. A short sleeve collared shirt paired well with shorts if I wanted to avoid wearing one of my three t-shirts. In total I carried six shirts. Two long sleeve button up, one short sleeve collared, and 3 tees. 2 pairs of shorts, one pair of pants, and I bought a second pair later during my trip. Hoody, puffy. That was all my clothes. \n\n3. I've been wearing barefoot shoes for almost 4 years now, so my feet have adjusted. I know that if I'm walking ALL DAY, my feet will be sore at night. Cork massage ball is a game changer. I only wear cushioned soles (Altra Lone Peak) on multi-day hiking trips, where I'm hiking sun up to sun down. Other than that, the barefoot shoes I prefer 99% of the time. Even for long day hikes. It's only on mile 40 of a multi-day hike where my feet are completely dead with barefoot shoes. I tried it haha. So, yes I loved the vivos for my entire trip. Very happy with them, and I wear them every day all the time. \n\n4. All my souveniers from 10 weeks - one postcard from Budapest I gifted to my parents. One beanie, a pair of jeans &amp; a canvas coat I got out of necessity when I hit colder weather in Budapest. A second beanie I bought to support one of my favorite bands. That was it. My souveniers are thousands of photos stored on a cloud lol. \n\n5. Zero issues, my bag easily fit in all lockers at hostels, under my seat on 2 airplanes &amp; many trains and buses. \n\n6. I only carried my bag when I moved hostels/cities. I'd lock it up &amp; explore all day long. Sometimes I carried it around for a while if I wanted to get lost and was in no hurry to drop it off at a new hostel. Because it's lightweight it didn't bother me.\n\n7. Yes! [I wrote more about that here](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/improve-your-travels-by-packing-light). So many people commented on my pack, surprised I carried so little. A lot of travelers, even at hostels, carry big packs or suitcases, &amp; sometimes multiple pieces of luggage. It's fun when people are interested in traveling with less. It's a topic I clearly love to talk about lol.\n\nAnd I'll add that I have zero regrets. Which is why my current gear list is literally this same list from this post, minus my kindle. Kindle is the only item I'd drop (or add) after my recent trip. \n\nMy current predicament is how the hell do I pack a laptop that doesn't add 2lbs or more.... I'd love to bring a tiny laptop to write. But not worth the weight, unless something exists that I'm unaware of haha.",

Certainly the Daylite Plus would work but it’s 18.9” tall\n- I really want to try the Gossamer Loris for this sort of kit. Their Minimalist pack is well named and a possibility,  maybe going a bit too small for me.\n- The Mystery Ranch Gallagator is 19 liters and I think it would make a very interesting minimalist pack.\n- Exped Typhoon 25 is 15.9 oz and waterproof. It will roll down to under seat length. One of few waterproof bags with water bottle pockets  and a good mesh back panel.  \n- The REI Trail 25 is on the large side and 2lbs total. I have used it onebagging to Hawaii and lots of weekend car trips. Equally good as a wilderness day pack and for EDC. Lots of bang for the buck and on sale a couple times a year ($56 11/23). At 19.5” it’s a bit tall for budget under seat. Resist filling it!",

The wildland firefighters involved in responding to that disaster are beyond impressive, clearly experts in the backcountry. But their packs look SO uncomfortable! They sit way down low, almost smacking into their thighs in some cases, and the straps are so loose on their backs that the packs are swinging around with every step. Is there a reason why they seem to take a radically different approach than a more recreational backpacker who typically carries the pack higher on the back and cinched up closer to their body? Obviously the firefighters are carrying orders of magnitude more weight than I ever do so there must be something to this. ",

Though the compartmentalization of all the pouches and attachments is useful, you can easily compartmentalize your gear into individual bags/containers and store them in a larger, more comfortable pack.\n\nHave you ever backpacked?   Have you ever tried to hike with something like the BOB in your pic for 20 miles a day?    Have you ever seen a backpacker carrying a bag with all kidns of attachments hanging on it?   Prolly not.   Doesn't make sense.   More room for error.   More things to get wet.   More making yourself a target cause you look like you have good stuff attached....\n\nBuy a comfortable pack made to haul more than you think you will need \\[you will always add stuff into it\\], and use smaller bags to compartmentalize your gear inside it .  Out of site of others.  Also makes it easier to grab a first aid kit, or fire kit, or whatever for instance to transport in another bag or vehicle.   Also you don't look like a military 'prepper' and make yourself a target ... \\[in the pic you highlight the name and quality of gear you are carrying such as 'sub zero' etc.\\]\n\nLook at Osprey, Kelty, Marmot, Mystery Ranch, REI and a host of other outdoor backpacking outfitters for a 50L or 60L or bigger,  bag and buy something that is comfortable and you are able to carry for miles/days/weeks if needed.   They may be top loading \\[in lieu of panel loading\\], and not have Molle system, or look tactical,  but they will be a lot more comfortable and allow you to travel much more reliably... and you can organize your preps in individual bags \\[ziplocks or as fancy as you want\\] within them.\n\njust my thoughts.",

That mindset is dangerous and unrealistic.  \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThe most prepared and seasoned outdoorsman wouldn't try to hit the woods to live.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIn most prepper's minds, does every SHTF event have to equate to a total collapse or an EMP type of event? \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nYour packs look too tactical. They're too heavy. Too much is hanging from them.  This rhetoric has been regurgitated over and over without any real thought. People want to sound informed, so they repeat the nonsense they heard on YouTube. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nNowhere in the history of humankind has an SHTF event been anywhere close to what's in the minds of most preppers today.  It makes for great dystopian books, but it ain't happening.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThere will not be hoards of criminals beating down your doors, but it may become unsafe to stay where you are. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nEveryone's not going to run off into the woods to survive because they would eventually die.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nCars aren't going to stop working suddenly but could become difficult or very expensive to drive.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIf things got so bad that it wasn't safe to walk down the street with a pack, it's not going to make a difference if the pack is camo, purple, or OD green. The idea that looking too \"tactical\" is flawed thinking unless you're walking into a secured government building.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIt would be fantastic if we could take a more realistic approach and apply just a little common sense before buying into the garbage being spewed all over the net. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, I think your packs look just fine, and I'm glad you took action and put them together. \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n/rant.

In defense of my statements I don't read the garbage spewed on the  internet and was just making a point that most tactical packs, such as that showed by the original post with add on bags attached, are not made for making distance comfortably.    Yes you may have to walk 20 miles, but even 5 miles with an uncomfortable pack, suck....\n\n I understand none of us know where the other comes from but I am not a read the news and rebroadcast it guy.   The point remains if you are building a BOB and need to be prepared for72 hours or longer, whether you are hiking 20 miles or 20 minutes, having all your gear in a single, comfortable, able to make waterproof quickly, pack is a smart thing to do.   Too many companies jumping into the hype and selling the pseudo-military, and cheaply made, expensive, gear that isn't that comfortable. well made or practical to survive from for any period of time.",
