It sounds like you're using travel backpack for EDC as well as travel which is something I might be interested in doing as well. Currently kind of torn between the everyday zip 20L but I think it might be a little bit too small and the 30L travel backpack.\n\nHow does the travel bag handle EDC? Is it possible to access the main compartment by just opening the zippers at the top like a more standard toploading bag or do you really have to put it down and unzip the whole panel to grab something out of it?\n\nAlso what does the travel backpack allow you to pack inside of it that the everyday zip couldn't handle?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "selftext": "Anyone have any experience fitting the XPS 17 laptop into the zip 20L laptop compartment?\n\nUPDATE 9/20/21  \nI purchased the Zip 20L from Amazon and returned it. The XPS 9710 does fit inside the laptop compartment however it is very extremely tight fit and that's not taking into account that I didn't even put my tablet in yet. It would also be nice if the laptop compartment opening was much larger as well. The bag was intended for daily commute to work and I'm just not too happy with having to physically apply force to get the laptop into the bag everyday.  \n\n\nI ended up buying a bag that was double the price but fits the laptop very well and the laptop compartment opening is great. The TUMI however lacks a dedicated tablet sleeve AND it lacks a false bottom feature to protect the laptop. Since the laptop compartment is very deep, I ended up putting my own custom padding at the bottom to protect the laptop. Regardless, I'm in love with the bag. I hope Peak Design can make some future adjustments and I'd happily hop back over. \n\nTUMI Ridgewood Backpack TAHOE  \n[https://www.tumi.com/p/ridgewood-backpack-01253991041/](https://www.tumi.com/p/ridgewood-backpack-01253991041/)\n\n[TUMI Ridgewood Backpack TAHOE](https://preview.redd.it/65s5636p0qo71.jpg?width=1648&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e21d2e84ea7d82080c942724fe5910189e2aed23)",

            "body": "I checked out the Everyday Backpack 20L V2 (regular version, not the Zip) today and believe the XPS 17 9700 or 9710 will fit that bag, although it will be tight.\n\nI tried my Dell Latitude 5500. These laptops have the following dimensions:\n\n* Height (Non-Touch): 0.79\" (20.3 mm)\n* Width: 14.1\" (359.1 mm)\n* Depth: 9.3\" (236.25 mm)\n* [https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/latitude-5500-business-laptop/spd/latitude-15-5500-laptop](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/latitude-5500-business-laptop/spd/latitude-15-5500-laptop)\n\nDell XPS 17 9710:\n\n* Height: 0.77‚Äù (19.05 mm)\n* Width: 14.74‚Äù (374.45 mm)\n* Depth: 9.76‚Äù (248.05 mm)\n* [https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-17-laptop/spd/xps-17-9710-laptop](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-17-laptop/spd/xps-17-9710-laptop)\n\nSo, the XPS 17 is 1.5 CM wider (requiring a taller bag) and 1.2 CM deeper (requiring a wider bag).\n\nAs I mentioned, I tested the Everyday Backpack 20L V2. The Zip 20L was not available. According to the Peak Design website, these backpacks have the exact same dimensions for the laptop compartment.[https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2986/1172/files/Dimensions-EDB-20L-1.jpg?v=1595354699](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2986/1172/files/Dimensions-EDB-20L-1.jpg?v=1595354699)\n\n[https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2986/1172/files/Dimensions-EDBZ-20L-1.jpg?v=1589219151](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2986/1172/files/Dimensions-EDBZ-20L-1.jpg?v=1589219151)\n\nAlthough it's not perfectly clear from the pictures, I am convinced that the regular version  has a few cm to spare in order to deal with a 'deeper' laptop (using Dell's terminology), in other words: the backpack is wide enough for the XPS 17 because it requires only 1.2 CM extra and there was about 3 CM of space left in the width of the backpack.\n\nThe height of the backpack will be more tight for the Everyday Backpack V2 20L as you can see from the pictures. What I did is put the hammock attached for just 0.5 to 1 CM, so the hammock was not actually doing anything.\n\nHere are the pictures of the Peak Design Everyday Backpack 20L V2 and a Dell Latitude 5500: [https://imgur.com/a/eRIqf9O](https://imgur.com/a/eRIqf9O)\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that the XPS 17 will work for the Peak Design Everyday Backpack **Zip** 20L, although I expect it to be so. The Backpack Zip 20L is taller than the Backpack 20L, so height wise the backpack should be OK. A disadvantage with that regular model will be that the few top CM's are not really protected for the laptop, there is just a zipper around it and that's it).\n\nBackpack width wise, I wonder what the difference will be. As you can see from the pictures the Latitude 5500 has a few CM left to spare in the Everyday Backpack 20L V2, but this backpack is 33 CM wide, while the Zip 20L is 29 CM wide according to Peak Design. So, even though the laptop compartments officially have the same dimensions, my guess is that the laptop compartment on the Zip will be more tight due to limited backpack width.\n\nThis is what I have been able to check so far. Did you find out anything more? Did you try the backpack yet? I am also looking at the Zip 20L and am planning to get a XPS 17.",

If you find another bag with similar dimensions, I can tell you that the XPS 17 fits very well inside the laptop sleeve and I can even squeeze in a Samsung Tab S8+ tablet in without being overly tight where it's difficult to take in and out.   \n\n\nInside the bag I have a camera case that supports my canon R5 with 3lb 28-70 lens and a 2.5 lb 100-500 lens. With everything inside the bag usually weighs over 24 lbs easy. Not kidding. It sits and supports on my back well however I have the backpack on top of a carry on luggage so it's rarely on my back.   \n\n\nWhen at home and not traveling, I use it as a daily driver to and from work with the XPS inside. I love the design however I wish it was ballistic nylon instead for added strength and durability. The nylon fabric isn't bad though and holding up very well so far.\n\nHere are 3 bags currently on their site I would consider. \n\n[https://www.tumi.com/p/finch-backpack-01253611041/](https://www.tumi.com/p/finch-backpack-01253611041/)\n\n[https://www.tumi.com/p/nottaway-backpack-01253581041/](https://www.tumi.com/p/nottaway-backpack-01253581041/)\n\n[https://www.tumi.com/p/woods-backpack-01355591041/](https://www.tumi.com/p/woods-backpack-01355591041/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!",

In my use case it affected how i use the bag when outside. The v2 is still better in many ways like the zippers used which was obvious immediately when i switched, but for the things i use a backpack for, it wasnt much of an upgrade - and since i prefer the look of the v1, jumped the gun when i saw it on sale.

Although the Maglatch doesn't come with a lock, it has its unique system that doesn't open conventionally. If you're not familiar with it, opening it can be challenging. This could potentially deter pickpockets from achieving their goal.‚Äù\nI find counting on the pickpockets being unfamiliar with a latch to be kind of a lame excuse considering the level of expertise @PD.\nHas anyone come up with a solution for this?\n",
