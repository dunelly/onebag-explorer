            "body": "So I got the Mountain 30 bag and the similarities to my favorite Osprey Transporter 30 are pretty astounding. Same general tapered funnel shape narrower at bottom. It actually loads the same with my gear.   \n  \nDifferences I can see are:   \n1. Side grab handle  \n2. double external bottle pockets   \n3. compression straps   \n4. Panel loading of course   \n5. No place for a blinky   \n6. Better material quality   \n7. Looks more mountain and less city   \n8. Longer narrower shape, fully four inches longer than the Osprey which is the deal breaker for me.  \n9. Capacity I would guess is about the same slightly favoring Osprey. The MPL loses a ton of main compartment capacity when you load the front panel.\n\nThe materials and construction are really nice, but I think I am sending it back due to fit.",

No additional charges or anything. I tried to find a sizer to take a picture but couldn’t find one so I just snapped a couple of underseat pics, so far it worked great and I liked how I could bring it on in unexpanded mode and then while on the plane I could expand it to throw any extra bulky items I had on into it seeing as though it wouldn’t get measured again on the rest of the trip. Great bag, any extra questions I’d be happy to try to help once I jump back on the wifi here.",

                "body": "Ayy hello fellow Wolverine and LSA-er! \n\nYes, the kickstand is built into the bag. Essentially it's a sturdy metal rod that goes up either side of the bag and forms a sort of square bottom that allows the bag to stand on its own. It also acts as a solid frame for the pack making it much nicer to wear, especially given the floating mesh back panel. The biggest downside, especially for onebaggers, is that, given the solid frame, it doesn't compress down. So the dimensions of the pack are pretty much rigid although you can flatten it down a bit. If that doesn't bother you, like it doesn't me, this is a fantastic feature and bag.\n\nOther Osprey packs that have this are the Tropos 34, of which is essentially a larger Parsec, and the Radial 26, which is meant more for bike commuting but shares a lot of similarities with the Parsec and can expand to 34L. Definitely check them out! Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: I'll just add - the kickstand on the newest versions of Osprey packs works great even when empty, although it helps having something in the bag to sort of weight it down. Older versions are notorious for not being able to stand unless the bag has contents to make it heavier to \"activate\" the kickstand. The current version works great though!",

If I were properly traveling and not vacationing, I'd skim down and have a different pack list, but figured this would make for a decent enough dry run.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably would've preferred going for the Osprey Radial 26+8 and a packable hip pack or sling, like the matador waist pack. Regardless, the Parsec, which I use as an everyday pack, worked wonderfully here. I was able to shove two medium-sized eagle creek packing cubes into the pack - one into the main compartment, and one into the secondary compartment. If I didn't bring my laptop, it would've been an easier fit, because it was difficult getting them both to fit. It was doable, but I'd look to pack down to make it work better. The pack also carried the weight well, but I don't want to speak to that until I've had to carry it for a significant enough distance. The pack carries similar to a hiking pack which was a huge draw for me, so I'm hoping it'll continue to carry things well. Another great feature of the Parsec is the set of mesh bottle holders on the sides. I shoved a 22oz Hydroflask on one side, and a 40oz on the other side with no trouble at all. And of course, I love the kickstand so the pack stands up on its own. It works perfectly 9 times out of 10, so long as it's on flat and/or solid ground. It did not want to stay upright on my bed, for example.\n\nThe Patagonia has become a sort of EDC pack for me, and worked great here. I used it to carry my electronics and misc gear, along with my Osprey toiletry kit. The kit is fantastic. It carried all my toiletries, has a hook to hang on the wall, and packs down pretty damn small. I probably want to downsize on my GoToobs though, because I've been noticing that they take up a lot of space. I believe I have the 2.5oz bottles, so I'll either downsize to the 1.7oz, or probably just use different bottles altogether. I'm not the biggest fan of them since some of the contents gather around the lid but don't actually come out when you squeeze.\n\nIf you have any recs on places to save space and trim down, feel free to let me know.

                "body": "Ayy hello fellow Wolverine and LSA-er! \n\nYes, the kickstand is built into the bag. Essentially it's a sturdy metal rod that goes up either side of the bag and forms a sort of square bottom that allows the bag to stand on its own. It also acts as a solid frame for the pack making it much nicer to wear, especially given the floating mesh back panel. The biggest downside, especially for onebaggers, is that, given the solid frame, it doesn't compress down. So the dimensions of the pack are pretty much rigid although you can flatten it down a bit. If that doesn't bother you, like it doesn't me, this is a fantastic feature and bag.\n\nOther Osprey packs that have this are the Tropos 34, of which is essentially a larger Parsec, and the Radial 26, which is meant more for bike commuting but shares a lot of similarities with the Parsec and can expand to 34L. Definitely check them out! Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: I'll just add - the kickstand on the newest versions of Osprey packs works great even when empty, although it helps having something in the bag to sort of weight it down. Older versions are notorious for not being able to stand unless the bag has contents to make it heavier to \"activate\" the kickstand. The current version works great though!",

It's a very simple card game wherein you have five decks of five cards upside down, each with varying levels of attack damage, shields which defend all attacks (I believe), and a crown that you are trying to destroy. You flip a card, and if it's an attack card, you choose one of your opponents five decks to attack, and essentially do this back and forward until one of you destroys the other's crown on the bottom of one of the piles.\n\nIt's a very simple game, and comes in such a small package! Each deck comes with two sets of cards, so two decks = four players. I'd recommend for a solid travel and social game!",

TLDR: I’m keeping both for now, but overall I know I’m happy with the Porter and not fully sold on the Daylite since I haven’t used it yet.\n\nWhen I placed a weight in each bag, I felt like the Porter was more comfortable overall. I don’t know if it’s just where the weight was sitting in the Daylight, but it pressed into the small of my back in an uncomfortable way. The sternum strap was also too low so that I couldn’t buckle it without it laying directly on top of my breasts. The Porter felt much more comfortable even without using the hip belt. It had more padding in the back, the sternum strap was higher, and there are these little buckles on the top of the shoulder straps that you can use to take more weight off your back and they make a noticeable difference. When empty, the Porter definitely does feel a bit heavier though. Also, I used my Porter in a hot climate, and don’t know that I necessarily need the back ventilation that the Daylite has. It might make a difference, but I don’t get too sweaty so it’s not high on my priority list.\n\nI tried to do a test pack, but found it difficult without a specific trip in mind. Instead, I just sort of stuffed my entire drawer of tshirts into each to gauge how many more the Porter could fit. I will say, the difference seemed like more than 4L even without utilizing all of the space in the exterior pockets of the Porter. I didn’t try to pack the Daylite with the expander extended since I don’t intend to pack it that way.\n\nAs I said before, I ultimately decided to keep them both for now. I’ve used the Porter before and I know I like it. I also like that I can under pack it I bit and overlap the sidewalls to make it slimmer. The sidewalls can also be used to cover the zippers as an anti theft measure so I felt pretty safe walking around with it. Meanwhile, I don’t want to sell the Daylite until I get a chance to actually try it out. \n\nLet me know what you end up getting and how it works out for you!",

It's only ever been a carry on which means carry on weight. This digs into my back and is actually quite painful after a bit of walking.\n\nRecognising that this obviously isn't a hiking backpack, is everyone just choosing to ignore this feature because everything else about the bag is amazing? Or am I just missing something?\n\nWould love to hear other people's experiences!",

Personally I'd probably just keep and use the Porter 30 and just have a larger personal item bag to go with it. A tote, sling, crossbody that is max size for a personal item like a Osprey Daylite Tote, Patagonia Black Hole Tote, Mystery Ranch Market, Mystery Ranch District Pro or District 8, North Face Voyager Sling, etc.",

So are you saying I would use the Porter 30 as the cabin bag and bring a similarly sized personal item? Not a bad idea. \n\nI have been struggling with the tote recently because it slips off my arm and two backpacks doesn’t work. Any idea on either how to get it to work crossbody or a crossbody of similar capacity and packability?",

I already own the Flash 45 which would of course not work under seat, but on all these international flights a cabin bag would be included in my ticket price.

Have tried on the 28 and 18 and both back panels fit my back. I tend to be the family Sherpa for a family of 3. On my Northface I never use my waist straps. When hiking I am 50/50 with waist straps. But, the MH Fluid 26 has no real structure and I always felt if it did it would be a better pack and less need for tight waist straps. \n\nHeaded to Mexico soon, Disneyland in the fall, and have a bit of hiking planned for summer. Going to order one today. Please weigh in! ",

I would wholeheartedly recommend the waist strap version.\n\nMy Osprey Manta 34 is perfect for me as EDC. I usually tighten the compression straps to make it really flat and when i need to put more stuff in it, there is always room and I never feel like I am carrying much because of the proper waist strap. It also allowes you to control even more how sweaty on a warm day your shoulders/back become if you loosen the shoulder straps.\n\nThe only downside in my opinion are the plastic buckles laying on the floor when you put the pack down as you might accidentally step on them. My solution is to tighten them close to the waist belt when I am not using the waist belt at all.\n\nLast benefit: You get an extra pocket (and a open top mesh pocket on the other side). Put there something that you always have with you but dont use often so you always know where it is (for example medical equipment for emergencies).",
