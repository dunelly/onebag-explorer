You should avoid your bag getting wet at all costs and keep it in a dry bag if there is a risk of that. Saying that, goretex would mean the bag is waterproof but would also limit the breathability of the bag and adds unnecessary cost. \n\nI bought a similar bag to these a long time ago and it's too warm except when it's below freezing. I use it for the rare winter backpacking trip but mostly car camping now. For backpacking in 32f (0c) or warmer, I'd recommend a lighter 750+ down quilt or rectangular bag. They are less material and less expensive but much more versatile and packable for backpacking for the summer.",

I break it out even when other partners are using their 28L or 32L sometimes because it’s really not bulky\n\nI’ve been using it for the last year or two, it’s become a daily driver. I got a small despite it being the wrong size because I didn’t want to wait and it’s still fine. Durable. Except for those ice tool carriers that always break off of every bag.\n\nAlso I find the straps that run along the back are too small to realistically fit much under, so I stick my helmet carrier on top and strap it there (the obvious answer is to throw your crampons there, but like I said I put my helmet there and have a foldable crampon bag I like using more (less futz)) \nThe brain often gets left behind if I don’t need it, like for single push efforts. I also removed the interior pocket because it gets in the way when I’m loading up my gear/avvy kit.\n\nThe way the bag closes can be annoying AF and come undone all the time so that unwittingly I’ll have this long strap dangling behind me like a tail. Also good luck using the side pockets for much of anything when you have your skies or snowshoes or z-pad strapped there \n\nBut overall, like I said it’s a daily driver of mine. Other people have asked for my opinion on this bag and I don’t know if you’ll find other commenters with as much experience with it, so I decided to leave you a detailed review. Yes, I have found my first tear in the bag recently- it’s been through a lot though. I was even fantasizing about using it for a long thru hike just the other week.\n\nFor comparison I broke out my AMG 105L the other day for some seriously horrible bushwhacking and felt like a tar monster with all that weight sinking he down into the depths of the snowpack. Whereas if I’m doing a multipitch rock climb in a single day I always break out the Alpine Light. I live on a popular PNW ski mountain and run laps up and down in this bag most days with weight. Skis great. I have multiple first winter ascents with this bag. I feel comfortable leading rock and ice in it.\n\nLOL tf is with this sub? THIS is why I had to leave you a review, because you’ve got 16 other useless comments rn of people who’ve never even used this bag and are just a peanut gallery gawking at prices or talking about the mass-used AMG. Lol y’all be fr, OP don’t ask about none of that shit",

            "body": "I have it. It’s ok. I break it out even when other partners are using their 28L or 32L sometimes because it’s really not bulky\n\nI’ve been using it for the last year or two, it’s become a daily driver. I got a small despite it being the wrong size because I didn’t want to wait and it’s still fine. Durable. Except for those ice tool carriers that always break off of every bag.\n\nAlso I find the straps that run along the back are too small to realistically fit much under, so I stick my helmet carrier on top and strap it there (the obvious answer is to throw your crampons there, but like I said I put my helmet there and have a foldable crampon bag I like using more (less futz)) \nThe brain often gets left behind if I don’t need it, like for single push efforts. I also removed the interior pocket because it gets in the way when I’m loading up my gear/avvy kit.\n\nThe way the bag closes can be annoying AF and come undone all the time so that unwittingly I’ll have this long strap dangling behind me like a tail. Also good luck using the side pockets for much of anything when you have your skies or snowshoes or z-pad strapped there \n\nBut overall, like I said it’s a daily driver of mine. Other people have asked for my opinion on this bag and I don’t know if you’ll find other commenters with as much experience with it, so I decided to leave you a detailed review. Yes, I have found my first tear in the bag recently- it’s been through a lot though. I was even fantasizing about using it for a long thru hike just the other week.\n\nFor comparison I broke out my AMG 105L the other day for some seriously horrible bushwhacking and felt like a tar monster with all that weight sinking he down into the depths of the snowpack. Whereas if I’m doing a multipitch rock climb in a single day I always break out the Alpine Light. I live on a popular PNW ski mountain and run laps up and down in this bag most days with weight. Skis great. I have multiple first winter ascents with this bag. I feel comfortable leading rock and ice in it.\n\nLOL tf is with this sub? THIS is why I had to leave you a review, because you’ve got 16 other useless comments rn of people who’ve never even used this bag and are just a peanut gallery gawking at prices or talking about the mass-used AMG. Lol y’all be fr, OP don’t ask about none of that shit",

I'll be the first to tell you that crag pack with a big ole zipper is way easier to just cram a bunch of crap in and easily get it out while hanging out at the bottom of the wall for a day of single pitch or top rope stuff.  Of course, if you're hiking in your gear and climbing with the pack, or need to haul your pack, or whatever, that's a different story.  This pack doesn't have a padded hip belt, so if you load it up with climbing gear, it's not going to be super comfy. On the other hand, it'll work better than a padded belt when you're climbing.\n\nAs /u/tatarstas mentioned, it's not particularly light for a light hiking pack, but go much lighter and it's going to come apart after a season or two of hauling, loading it up with a rack of cams and dropping it on scree, etc.\n\nReally just depends on what you're doing and what your needs are.\n\nClimbing and hiking range from gym rats and nature walks to winter alpine ascents and peak bagging, and different bags will be better at either end of the spectrum.",

Just got back from 7 days in the Galapagos and used this pack as my “personal item” and then had a carry on. It fit all of my outdoor items (snorkel, mask, DJI cam &amp; accessories, dry bag, etc) extra jacket, and all my normal plane/daily items and extra items that wouldn’t fit in my carry on. The front stash pocket is great for last minute items and the 2 side water pockets are stretchy enough and big enough to fit to water bottles each. Lots of space and lots of inner pockets in the front to organize/store things. \n\nOnce on the islands, this bag was my everywhere pack. I brought a waterproof cover (I did get stuck in the rain several times) and this went with me to the beach, on hikes/walks, around town, etc. I really love this as my travel pack and have used it on other adventure trips. \n\nI’m an experienced hiker and backpacker and would be comfortable carrying this as a day pack on a hike as well. I haven’t used it to carry a laptop so I can’t speak on that. I’d love to get this in the orange color but they’re all sold out.",

I try to initiate a return via the website, reporting the defect. It didn't seem to matter as they then tried to charge me $6 for a label and pick a specific UPS location from the list. I have to speak with customer service. They have a terrible chat interface. The individual kept asking me for information I had already provided. They required photos of the defects (I had already packed the item). I couldn't send the photos via my phone even though the text messages were simultaneously going to my computer and phone. Then they needed a team of people to generate the UPS label. I explained I didn't have a printer like most people these days. They said that I could just show the label to someone at USPS. I explained it doesn't work that way. Then they suggested I go to a library or find someone else with a printer. Seriously?!",
