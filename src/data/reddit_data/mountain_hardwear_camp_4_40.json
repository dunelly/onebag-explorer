            "body": "I thought I'd share a dream project of mine. I've built about 7-8 shelters before but I've wanted for a while to build a group tent tough enough for the strong winds that we get when offroad camping in Death Valley. Weight was a secondary priority because we'd be carrying the tent in off road vehicles, but still I didn't want anything that was unwieldy and heavy to set up. The end result is this tent, which measures about 10x12' along the floor and 83\" headroom in the middle. It weighs 26.0 lbs, about half of which comes from the poles (14.7 lbs). The tent is symmetric, with two doors on each end and a mesh-covered vent above each door.\n\nI'm really happy with how the tent turned out! We took it out for 6 nights out in Death Valley, where we did get some nasty winds and rain throughout. The number of poles is slightly overkill but they serve their purpose; the tent held up well against the wind and I didn’t notice any flexing. I didn't do any seam sealing and some rain did eventually seep through but it was limited to harmless flow along the walls and the occasional drip; I might eventually build a proper rainfly if this annoys me enough.\n\nSome random design notes:\n\n* I cribbed a lot of design cues from Hilleberg's group tents, in particular their Atlas tent. Hilleberg has a lot of clever ideas; I especially like that they use a combination of pole sleeves and pole clips which makes it reasonably easy for one person to set up the entire tent. Copying that idea, however, meant I had to build 84 (!!) tent pole clips. That… took a while.\n* Overall I spent about a month designing the tent and another 1.5 months building it. My design process is sorta unusual; instead of using CAD programs I write my designs out as Python code. I have a background in software engineering and mathematics so this is what is just natural to me. The plus side is that since it's all code I can easily tweak parameters, swap out components, etc and the rest of the design will update itself to match. This let me quickly play with different ideas, as well as find parameters that optimized interior space, pole tension, etc.\n* Most of the tent was built using 2.2oz HEX70 fabric from rbtr, with 200D oxford for places that needed less stretchy fabric like the pole sleeves. Poles are .625\" aluminum from QuestOutfitters.\n* The real MVP of the project ended up being a bench-top hot knife webbing cutter I picked off Amazon. There are so many bits of webbing throughout the project that being able to quickly and evenly cut them proved to be a life saver. Still, I can’t overstate how much work the whole project was! Material costs also racks up quickly.\n* **The single biggest mistake I see online for myog dome tents is assuming that the poles will bend into a semi-circle or catenary curve when in reality the arch isn't anything close!** Luckily, someone did the hard work of researching the bend equation and posted their findings [here](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/bending-of-a-long-thin-elastic-rod-or-wire-finding-shape-height.735200/) complete with code! Note that their written equation has a small typo (they forgot to wrap the denominator in the integral with a sqrt) but the code is accurate. For my project, I transposed the code to Python and verified that the results match real-world testing.\n* I ended up building a dedicated pole bag that keeps each pole separated because there were so many poles and they kept tangling while testing. Tangling is something to keep in mind when building a tent with this many poles.\n* The storm flaps that surround the doors ended up being a weirdly complex time sink. The flaps have elastic cordage running along the perimeter for tension, removable webbing along the ground that keeps the walls taught, guy-out points to reduce flapping in heavy wind, of course door toggles, and finally a toggle that locks the zippers in place (an idea inspired by Hilleberg tents).\n\nWhew! Anyways, thanks for reading this far. I might start posting other projects of mine if people find these kinds of projects interesting.",

            "body": "I thought I'd share a dream project of mine. I've built about 7-8 shelters before but I've wanted for a while to build a group tent tough enough for the strong winds that we get when offroad camping in Death Valley. Weight was a secondary priority because we'd be carrying the tent in off road vehicles, but still I didn't want anything that was unwieldy and heavy to set up. The end result is this tent, which measures about 10x12' along the floor and 83\" headroom in the middle. It weighs 26.0 lbs, about half of which comes from the poles (14.7 lbs). The tent is symmetric, with two doors on each end and a mesh-covered vent above each door.\n\nI'm really happy with how the tent turned out! We took it out for 6 nights out in Death Valley, where we did get some nasty winds and rain throughout. The number of poles is slightly overkill but they serve their purpose; the tent held up well against the wind and I didn’t notice any flexing. I didn't do any seam sealing and some rain did eventually seep through but it was limited to harmless flow along the walls and the occasional drip; I might eventually build a proper rainfly if this annoys me enough.\n\nSome random design notes:\n\n* I cribbed a lot of design cues from Hilleberg's group tents, in particular their Atlas tent. Hilleberg has a lot of clever ideas; I especially like that they use a combination of pole sleeves and pole clips which makes it reasonably easy for one person to set up the entire tent. Copying that idea, however, meant I had to build 84 (!!) tent pole clips. That… took a while.\n* Overall I spent about a month designing the tent and another 1.5 months building it. My design process is sorta unusual; instead of using CAD programs I write my designs out as Python code. I have a background in software engineering and mathematics so this is what is just natural to me. The plus side is that since it's all code I can easily tweak parameters, swap out components, etc and the rest of the design will update itself to match. This let me quickly play with different ideas, as well as find parameters that optimized interior space, pole tension, etc.\n* Most of the tent was built using 2.2oz HEX70 fabric from rbtr, with 200D oxford for places that needed less stretchy fabric like the pole sleeves. Poles are .625\" aluminum from QuestOutfitters.\n* The real MVP of the project ended up being a bench-top hot knife webbing cutter I picked off Amazon. There are so many bits of webbing throughout the project that being able to quickly and evenly cut them proved to be a life saver. Still, I can’t overstate how much work the whole project was! Material costs also racks up quickly.\n* **The single biggest mistake I see online for myog dome tents is assuming that the poles will bend into a semi-circle or catenary curve when in reality the arch isn't anything close!** Luckily, someone did the hard work of researching the bend equation and posted their findings [here](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/bending-of-a-long-thin-elastic-rod-or-wire-finding-shape-height.735200/) complete with code! Note that their written equation has a small typo (they forgot to wrap the denominator in the integral with a sqrt) but the code is accurate. For my project, I transposed the code to Python and verified that the results match real-world testing.\n* I ended up building a dedicated pole bag that keeps each pole separated because there were so many poles and they kept tangling while testing. Tangling is something to keep in mind when building a tent with this many poles.\n* The storm flaps that surround the doors ended up being a weirdly complex time sink. The flaps have elastic cordage running along the perimeter for tension, removable webbing along the ground that keeps the walls taught, guy-out points to reduce flapping in heavy wind, of course door toggles, and finally a toggle that locks the zippers in place (an idea inspired by Hilleberg tents).\n\nWhew! Anyways, thanks for reading this far. I might start posting other projects of mine if people find these kinds of projects interesting.",

            "body": "I thought I'd share a dream project of mine. I've built about 7-8 shelters before but I've wanted for a while to build a group tent tough enough for the strong winds that we get when offroad camping in Death Valley. Weight was a secondary priority because we'd be carrying the tent in off road vehicles, but still I didn't want anything that was unwieldy and heavy to set up. The end result is this tent, which measures about 10x12' along the floor and 83\" headroom in the middle. It weighs 26.0 lbs, about half of which comes from the poles (14.7 lbs). The tent is symmetric, with two doors on each end and a mesh-covered vent above each door.\n\nI'm really happy with how the tent turned out! We took it out for 6 nights out in Death Valley, where we did get some nasty winds and rain throughout. The number of poles is slightly overkill but they serve their purpose; the tent held up well against the wind and I didn’t notice any flexing. I didn't do any seam sealing and some rain did eventually seep through but it was limited to harmless flow along the walls and the occasional drip; I might eventually build a proper rainfly if this annoys me enough.\n\nSome random design notes:\n\n* I cribbed a lot of design cues from Hilleberg's group tents, in particular their Atlas tent. Hilleberg has a lot of clever ideas; I especially like that they use a combination of pole sleeves and pole clips which makes it reasonably easy for one person to set up the entire tent. Copying that idea, however, meant I had to build 84 (!!) tent pole clips. That… took a while.\n* Overall I spent about a month designing the tent and another 1.5 months building it. My design process is sorta unusual; instead of using CAD programs I write my designs out as Python code. I have a background in software engineering and mathematics so this is what is just natural to me. The plus side is that since it's all code I can easily tweak parameters, swap out components, etc and the rest of the design will update itself to match. This let me quickly play with different ideas, as well as find parameters that optimized interior space, pole tension, etc.\n* Most of the tent was built using 2.2oz HEX70 fabric from rbtr, with 200D oxford for places that needed less stretchy fabric like the pole sleeves. Poles are .625\" aluminum from QuestOutfitters.\n* The real MVP of the project ended up being a bench-top hot knife webbing cutter I picked off Amazon. There are so many bits of webbing throughout the project that being able to quickly and evenly cut them proved to be a life saver. Still, I can’t overstate how much work the whole project was! Material costs also racks up quickly.\n* **The single biggest mistake I see online for myog dome tents is assuming that the poles will bend into a semi-circle or catenary curve when in reality the arch isn't anything close!** Luckily, someone did the hard work of researching the bend equation and posted their findings [here](https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/bending-of-a-long-thin-elastic-rod-or-wire-finding-shape-height.735200/) complete with code! Note that their written equation has a small typo (they forgot to wrap the denominator in the integral with a sqrt) but the code is accurate. For my project, I transposed the code to Python and verified that the results match real-world testing.\n* I ended up building a dedicated pole bag that keeps each pole separated because there were so many poles and they kept tangling while testing. Tangling is something to keep in mind when building a tent with this many poles.\n* The storm flaps that surround the doors ended up being a weirdly complex time sink. The flaps have elastic cordage running along the perimeter for tension, removable webbing along the ground that keeps the walls taught, guy-out points to reduce flapping in heavy wind, of course door toggles, and finally a toggle that locks the zippers in place (an idea inspired by Hilleberg tents).\n\nWhew! Anyways, thanks for reading this far. I might start posting other projects of mine if people find these kinds of projects interesting.",

It’s down and thin and I think below 60° it’s useless. Also my load out was way to heavy. I cold soaked and still think I had 35-45lbs.",

That'll allow more humidity to escape.\n\nAs for your bag, I think you nailed it. That bag isn't rated for the weather you were in. A general rule of thumb is that the temperature number on the bag is the \"survival\" rating and not the comfort rating. Always get a bag/quilt with a comfort rating in the range that you'll be in (with comfortable variable room in case the temperature drops).\n\nYou mention your bag was a bit heavy. Definitely feel free to itemize your gear and some of us can help critique it.\n\nFinally, just a note that where you hiked isn't too far from Eagle Rock Loop in Langley, Arkansas. It's a super fun 30 mile loop that I highly recommend.",

            "body": "I backpack and camp in a wet/cold environment (Wisconsin/UP Michigan) from May until November. A few things based on my experiences:\n\n1. Try not to sleep low and near water. Sometimes you just have to, but fog collects in hollows like that. Skurka has a [great guide](https://andrewskurka.com/tag/five-star-campsite-selection/) on campsite selection. The difference between a good site and a bad site can be 10 degrees and a lot of moisture and bugs.\n2. For most sleeping bag manufacturers, you need to add at least 15 degrees to the comfort rating of a bag to get a true representation of how it sleeps. For shoulder season camping in SW Arkansas (looks like lows of around 40?), I'd probably want a bag rated for 15. The exception is Western Mountaineering, who rates their bags conservatively. I would not hesitate to take my WM Summerlite (rated to 32F) down to 25 or so.\n3. Your mat is just as important as your bag for keeping you warm. That Sleepingo mat does not have an R-Value listed, so I will assume it has effectively no insulation. So...you just lose a ton of body heat to the ground. You'll want to get a mat from a reputable manufacturer (Sea to Summit, Thermarest, Nemo) with an R value of 3.6+ for your area. I run a 4\" thick pad with an R value of 6.2, because the ground will sometimes still be frozen when I get started for the season. And I *hate* sleeping cold.\n4. Others are mentioning ventilation, but if it's fog, I would go the other way. I would button up my rain fly as much as I can and pop open the tent's vents (if it has any). It doesn't sound like you got wet from condensation on the inside (which would be fairly unusual with a two wall design anyway), but you got wet because it failed to keep you dry from moisture on the outside. Maybe pitch your tent in your yard and hit it with a hose with a mist nozzle on it - if water is penetrating the rain fly, you've found your problem.\n5. 35-45 lbs is heavy, especially if you don't have a stove. I bet if you weighed your stuff individually, you'd be shocked at how heavy your tent, bag, and mat are - especially relative to their performance.\n6. Others mentioned synthetic fill for your bag. I strongly disagree with this - synthetic is something I'd reach for only if I was bringing it for emergency mountain bivvys. As long as you have a shelter that does it's job, down is *ideal*.",

Sometimes you just have to, but fog collects in hollows like that. Skurka has a [great guide](https://andrewskurka.com/tag/five-star-campsite-selection/) on campsite selection. The difference between a good site and a bad site can be 10 degrees and a lot of moisture and bugs.\n2. For most sleeping bag manufacturers, you need to add at least 15 degrees to the comfort rating of a bag to get a true representation of how it sleeps. For shoulder season camping in SW Arkansas (looks like lows of around 40?), I'd probably want a bag rated for 15. The exception is Western Mountaineering, who rates their bags conservatively. I would not hesitate to take my WM Summerlite (rated to 32F) down to 25 or so.\n3. Your mat is just as important as your bag for keeping you warm. That Sleepingo mat does not have an R-Value listed, so I will assume it has effectively no insulation. So...you just lose a ton of body heat to the ground. You'll want to get a mat from a reputable manufacturer (Sea to Summit, Thermarest, Nemo) with an R value of 3.6+ for your area. I run a 4\" thick pad with an R value of 6.2, because the ground will sometimes still be frozen when I get started for the season. And I *hate* sleeping cold.\n4. Others are mentioning ventilation, but if it's fog, I would go the other way. I would button up my rain fly as much as I can and pop open the tent's vents (if it has any). It doesn't sound like you got wet from condensation on the inside (which would be fairly unusual with a two wall design anyway), but you got wet because it failed to keep you dry from moisture on the outside. Maybe pitch your tent in your yard and hit it with a hose with a mist nozzle on it - if water is penetrating the rain fly, you've found your problem.\n5. 35-45 lbs is heavy, especially if you don't have a stove. I bet if you weighed your stuff individually, you'd be shocked at how heavy your tent, bag, and mat are - especially relative to their performance.\n6. Others mentioned synthetic fill for your bag. I strongly disagree with this - synthetic is something I'd reach for only if I was bringing it for emergency mountain bivvys. As long as you have a shelter that does it's job, down is *ideal*.",

However, thanks to the frame I find the heavier load to be more manageable. I think sizing is pretty important, I got a M/L and honestly wish I had gotten a S/M. So if you haven’t already see if you can try them on in store first, especially if you can test them with your gear. The avy pocket is pretty big, but still make sure your shovel and probe actually fit. Really the only feature that’s missing is ice axe storage but other than that it has all the features, functionality, and durability that you could possibly want (I especially like the side vertical expandable pockets)",

However, thanks to the frame I find the heavier load to be more manageable. I think sizing is pretty important, I got a M/L and honestly wish I had gotten a S/M. So if you haven’t already see if you can try them on in store first, especially if you can test them with your gear. The avy pocket is pretty big, but still make sure your shovel and probe actually fit. Really the only feature that’s missing is ice axe storage but other than that it has all the features, functionality, and durability that you could possibly want (I especially like the side vertical expandable pockets)",

You can try the pad in the hammock, but it kind of defeats the purpose. It will be cold enough to the point of being dangerous. I wouldn’t even consider that trip without the minimum of a 0 degree bag and 8+r pad and probably a Z pad for under that. Unless you will have immediate access to a warm place (car or heated building) don’t attempt this without a trial run. I’ve been stuck out in those conditions because of my own idiocy before and it resulted in me hiking out in the middle of the night and feeling like I might not make it out.

The tent is fine, and easy to set up, etc. but after owning it and using it for half a year I observe that it doesn’t fit comfortably either vertically or horizontally on my pack when I’m hiking.  Packed, mine is roughly 26” long.  I suspect it’s length might be a bit awkward if you’re looking at stowing it in or attaching it to a pannier etc for moto camping too.",

The idea was to have the capacity to overnight without a water source in the desert with temps in the 80s. If I have a water source I put dirty in the MSR and filter into the Vargo Bot. Using it as a water bottle. Or sometimes I leave the Bot and use a generic bottle for clean water. \n\nI do actually have a headlamp but It's not always on my list since my phone has a light if needed. \n\nI have a small knife but I usually don't use it for anything, maybe it should go with me anyways more for first aid purposes. \n\nI usually print a paper map as a back up, forgot to mention that. \n\nSpare underwears/socks I only bring if going more than 3 days. \n\nAs for cooking I bought the Bot recently and don't have much experience with it yet. I bought it with the idea of cold soaking and occasionally having fires where allowed. Cold soaking sort of sucks though after a few days. \n\nThe Tarp is a ground cloth 99% of the time as I live in SW AZ where it rarely rains. But when I set it up I just sort of jerry-rig it to trees or rocks. If there's a significant chance or rain I do have a tent I would bring. \n\nThe rope was for the shelter but you are right I do have some for bear hangs. forgot to add it.\n\nAs for another layer I have a lightweight jacket I bring as needed if nighttime temps are below 55F. \n\nI should probably add tp, trowel, and handy-san to my list but I admit I often just make do without. \n\nFood is usually ramen, instant potatoes, and Knorr sides if I'm bringing a stove.

            "body": "I've had one for going on 3 years now and I really like it.  There seems to be a lot of complaints about wind speed accuracy, with it being too low.  I had the same problem and after a few back and forth exchanges with support telling me it was due to my low mounting height and nearby trees, I bought a cheap handheld anemometer.  Held the anemometer up right next to the Tempest sensor and the two were almost identical, so they were right.\n\nAnother thing it has going for it that doesn't get much attention is that it the Tempest network puts together it's own weather forecasts based off of your specific location using data it's has collected from your sensor.  The forecast, at least for me, has proven itself more accurate than any other forecast source. Weather data and history are cool to have, but what is really important is future predictions and the Tempest reliably beats weather.com, WeatherBug, AccuWeather, etc.  The forecasts crush it.\n\nAlso, if you handy at all with computers and programming, Tempest provides an open API that is really good and allows you to access your weather data to do a lot of fun stuff with it.  I've done all kinds of projects with it.",
