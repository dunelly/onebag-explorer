I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs. This pack is lightweight, comfortable, with extra exterior stash space as well as two roomy water bottle holders.

I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs. This pack is lightweight, comfortable, with extra exterior stash space as well as two roomy water bottle holders.

I always take the 3.5mm wired earbuds for the plane infotainment system as well.",

I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs.

I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs. This pack is lightweight, comfortable, with extra exterior stash space as well as two roomy water bottle holders.

I went searching for a backpack to replace my Samsonite wheeler backpack that I finally acknowledged as being too cumbersome.  That thread is here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/vrrndj/looking\\_for\\_travel\\_backpack\\_recommendations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/vrrndj/looking_for_travel_backpack_recommendations/)\n\n  \nFirst, to this sub for the incredible amount of information.  I'll admit that I'm not really a Onebagger in the sense that many of the folks here are.  I travel, but not on the wonderful adventures that many folks here do where I need to carry a bag with all of my stuff often from place to place nor do I get to do any hiking/trails.  That said, when I travel with my wife and two little ones, I can still take advantage of a lot of the ideas here to be able to pack the most necessary stuff for my kids and me in a comfortable, regulation conforming fashion.  The tips, tricks, suggestions here have been great.  I've enjoyed having this sub as a rabbit hole.  I've found bags, I learned what a packing cube is  (then learned what a compression cube is), I've found clothing suggestions, I've found gear recommendations, and I gained just enough knowledge to spend a lot of my Amazon Prime Day budget on stuff related to this sub.  \nSecond, I want to give an extra bit of gratitude to the following users for taking the time to offer up suggestions in what I know is the millionth iteration of the same type thread seeking recommendations.\n\n  \nu/tblue1  \nu/ThePermanentGuest  \nu/calmlaundry  \nu/Xerisca   \nu/4ctw  \nu/Ropes4u\n\n  \nI read many, many recommendation threads and still felt compelled to make my own.  While it was novel for me, I know it isn't so much for folks that spend time in this sub, so I wanted to thank these users for taking the time to give me some good, honest recommendations.  While I didn't specifically use one of the bags mentioned in the thread, the food for thought provided by each recommendations lead me to better understand what I needed to look for, what features I needed to prioritize, and an expansion of my search that ultimately lead to a satisfying purchase.\n\n  \nUltimately, I settled on an Osprey Porter 46 + Daylite Plus.  I gave up a few things that a lot of people value from bags like the Farpoint 40, but given my uses, I think the tradeoffs work slightly in my favor.  I had spent a little time looking at the bags like the Duplex - the travel + day bag combo was appealing, but I wasn't quite sold on the bag overall after trying it out.  When I saw that the Daylite could be attached to the Porter, I felt like I had a solution.  Tried the bags out, found a color combo I liked, then pulled the trigger.\n\n  \nI took a trip recently to Red River, NM with the family and packed my goods, plus a bit for my kids, in the Porter 46.  It was a delight to pack, to store, to re-pack, and to bring back home.  My Daylite Plus has been set up for regular use for the days that I don't work from home and travel in to the office.  It carries my laptop, 14+\" tablet, keyboard, mouse, USB fan, and water bottle just fine.  I tested it out with the Porter 46 and I think it is going to make airport travel much easier to have my carry-on and personal item on my back, freeing my hands to help facilitate showing passports, helping my kids, drinking a beer, etc.\n\n  \nSo that's it, for now.  Big thanks to the community.  I'm on the hunt now for a pack I can attach to my waist-belt - potentially a fanny-pack instead per the recommendations in my original thread.  Keep up the great content and helpful spirit of the sub.  I'll learn enough here soon to perhaps pay it forward down the road.  In the meantime, if you need any help with anything related to BBQ or data modeling, let me know - I can't at least provide some value there :D.",

While it was novel for me, I know it isn't so much for folks that spend time in this sub, so I wanted to thank these users for taking the time to give me some good, honest recommendations.  While I didn't specifically use one of the bags mentioned in the thread, the food for thought provided by each recommendations lead me to better understand what I needed to look for, what features I needed to prioritize, and an expansion of my search that ultimately lead to a satisfying purchase.\n\n  \nUltimately, I settled on an Osprey Porter 46 + Daylite Plus.  I gave up a few things that a lot of people value from bags like the Farpoint 40, but given my uses, I think the tradeoffs work slightly in my favor.  I had spent a little time looking at the bags like the Duplex - the travel + day bag combo was appealing, but I wasn't quite sold on the bag overall after trying it out.  When I saw that the Daylite could be attached to the Porter, I felt like I had a solution.  Tried the bags out, found a color combo I liked, then pulled the trigger.\n\n  \nI took a trip recently to Red River, NM with the family and packed my goods, plus a bit for my kids, in the Porter 46.  It was a delight to pack, to store, to re-pack, and to bring back home.  My Daylite Plus has been set up for regular use for the days that I don't work from home and travel in to the office.  It carries my laptop, 14+\" tablet, keyboard, mouse, USB fan, and water bottle just fine.  I tested it out with the Porter 46 and I think it is going to make airport travel much easier to have my carry-on and personal item on my back, freeing my hands to help facilitate showing passports, helping my kids, drinking a beer, etc.\n\n  \nSo that's it, for now.  Big thanks to the community.  I'm on the hunt now for a pack I can attach to my waist-belt - potentially a fanny-pack instead per the recommendations in my original thread.  Keep up the great content and helpful spirit of the sub.  I'll learn enough here soon to perhaps pay it forward down the road.  In the meantime, if you need any help with anything related to BBQ or data modeling, let me know - I can't at least provide some value there :D.",

I also found the compression straps to work well to restrict the bags depth, needing to pack it at most 20cm deep for my next trip. The laptop compartment also seems very well made.

Acted as my main insulation layer.\n   * Patagonia R1 - worn while skiing underneath the Columbia Fleece. Also used it to wrap around my laptop, since the pouch in the backpack is not super protective. Worked well.\n   * Patagonia Capilene Cool T-shirts x 3 - great shirts\n   * Smartwool 150 base layer pants - did great while skiing\n   * Smartwool 150 base layer long sleeve shirt (I never wore this.

Basically all I wear.\n   * Burton Gloves - 10 years old, not anything special, but they do the trick.\n   * UnderArmour light gloves - never used these, but brought in case the Burton's needed a liner\n   * UnderArmour Sweatpants - worn over my base layer while skiing. Kept me warm enough, and are pretty nice. I don't have any nice ski pants, so used these as my insulating layer underneath my rain pants (below).\n   * REI Rain Pants - Fully wind and waterproof.

I‚Äôve used the Daylite Plus quite a bit and I have a Deuter backpack which is the same design as the Gogo (it is a model that‚Äôs used for company brandings) but haven‚Äôt used the ‚ÄúGogo‚Äù so far. It arrived just before I went on holiday. I do have other Deuter backpacks with the back system though.\n\nBoth are fairly the same weight, lighter than all of my other backpacks. The Daylite has a slim textured back panel and thin, breathable straps. It‚Äôs good when you carry light/few things.

At the moment I am using Dakine Transit 18L, but I feel like I need slightly more space (around 20-25 L.) \n\nWhat do you think of Osprey Daylite Plus 20L or Deuter Gogo 25L ? \nIf anyone is using any those two already, what are their pros and cons? \nAre the any alternative backpack models?\n\nThank you for any help ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Plus, I love Osprey‚Äôs warranty. My one qualm is that there is only one dinky looking strap to hold down everything in the largest compartment. \n\nI love that the Cotopaxi has mesh dividers, but it very slightly exceeds personal item size (19 inch vs 18inch) and it doesn‚Äôt have that cool expansion zipper. Also - it‚Äôs $100 more. Idk if mesh dividers are worth $100 especially if the warranty isn‚Äôt as good as Osprey‚Äôs. \n\nWould love some advice from folks with experience with these or similar bags.

        "selftext": "I just got back from a trip with 4 flights through Frontier taking my Osprey Daylite Plus so I took the chance to take pictures for anyone interested. One of my qualms of the bag was the listed height of 18.9'' but I found when packed \\~90% full it is really only about 17.5\". It could easily fit even smaller if you are allowed to squeeze as long as you leave a little bit of space at the top of the bag. I also took a video of the bag sliding in without force since there were reports that some agents were only allowing that to count. ( [https://imgur.com/da5J3QE](https://imgur.com/da5J3QE) )\n\n* Flight 1 - barely any bags were tested, a couple obviously oversized ones had to use sizer and pay.\n* Flight 2 - almost every bag that was eyeballed to be about the sizer dimensions or exceeding were told to test.\n* Flight 3 - about 75% of the bags were tested. This held up the line a long time and by the end the last \\~20-25 people on the flight were waved through to expedite boarding. We didn't even scan the boarding pass as there was one worker who verbally relayed the Sequence code of everyone passing through to the other one on the computer.\n* Flight 4 - just about every bag that looked like it might barely meet the size requirements was tested. The worker was not paying as much attention so quite a few people took things out and put them on the ground and got the okay. Very strict about the second item though - if someone had any kind of purse or tote as well as a backpack, they were told to pay.\n* Note: I was never asked to use the sizer on any flights and very generous squishing was allowed for each flight.\n\nHope this helps someone as I had my own worries before these flights and have seen lots of posts about Frontier recently.\n\n[Frontier sizer](https://preview.redd.it/gztaw0hsr9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a6d5351c391ba66e73576a511b727fa8623ccc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Frontier sizer - top view](https://preview.redd.it/lcajczyxr9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa33c3d798ec1a30dc9e2071c266b90d489d655f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Spirit sizer](https://preview.redd.it/fqaebyd3v9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=980f9ff0c2069dc7988ec5344698ab463ecf4df0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[spirit sizer - top view](https://preview.redd.it/ihqfanv4v9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10e76c2e025fc9cfc37ddf52a61e311b7dfb1735)",

The Gregory Swift is my more technical ‚Äúday hiking‚Äù bag, and it has a spot for a hydration bladder if I choose to use one. The Osprey Ozone would be for ‚Äúone-bagging‚Äù, maybe a 3-5 day trip. \n\nI have more backpacks not pictured, but these are some of my favorites! üòÖüòÇ\n\nEdit: added more detail about the Daylite Travel backpack",

I bought a Dechatlon NH500 30L backpack for 26 EUR and I'm not quite happy with it. First, I probably will never have to utilise 30L of space. I'm currently an Erasmus student, travelling all over EU but mostly 2-3 days at once and I assume I will use my backpack to go to work with a laptop or some weekend trips in my future life.\n\nThe dechatlon bag has no padding or no false bottom on it to protect my 15.6 inch laptop so I have to get a laptop sleeve which whill cost another 10~ EUR. It is also quite bulky (1KG) and looks big on me since I'm not the tallest. I can return the dechatlon bag and get the Osprey for 60 EUR. I also don't know If the osprey's all mighty guarantee will cover it or not because I'll purchase the bag in Germany and use it for the rest of my life in Turkey.\n\nI didn't buy any backpacks previous to this, my first backpack purchase was the dechatlon one since I got the nike one from my brother. I would love to get more experienced backpackers opinions or some alternatives. Thank you!",
