I would like my budget to be 150 or below but I could go like no more than 30-40 (this osprey). As shown above I have been looking at these two packs, the alps mountaineering nomad 75 and the osprey rook 65. Would want some feedback on which one of these two to get, or if there are some other better packs in the price range.",

I'm curious if anyone here has experience with this brands before. I'm new to the campaing/hiking gear world so I'm still learning a lot, and I don't want to blow my money on something that won't last. \n\nLinks to the Mountainsmith and Alps bags in question.

Overall capacity is less important than where the weight rides in my experience. You can have a 45L pack with a hip belt that carries better than a 25L pack with a thin waist strap. \n\nCheck out the mystery ranch scree for a similar size bag with a great hip belt.
