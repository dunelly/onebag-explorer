The large logo isn’t the best but I’ve heard that it’s easy to remove so I’ll see about that. Water bottle pockets are nice, don’t take up space and are tight so things don’t fall out.

            "body": "Hi,  \nI am currently using the Patagonia Black Hole 321 for almost all of  my onebag travels. It ticks most of my likings but during the time  traveling with it I found some downsides for my specific use case.  That's why I thought switching to the new Eagle Creek Explore 26l  might the solution for my needs. There is almost no information  about this bag, that's why I need your help.  \n\nWhat I disliked about the Black Hole 32l:  \n- no side acess to the main compartment (quick acess while bag is  on the shoulder)  \n- flimsy backpanael with almost no ventilation\n- no strap at the mesh pockets to hold tripods oder fishing rods  \n\nWhat I liked about the Black Hole and don't want to miss in other  bags:  \n- very light\n- looks nice, even in the city  \n- versatile (bring all your stuff to your travel destination, bring just what you need to the city etc)\n\nWhat I usually bring: \n- Patagonia Black Hole Cube - Large (for all my cloth)  \n- Patagonia Black Hole Cube - Medium (for underwear)  \n- Patagonia Black Hole Cube - Small (as a very small techcase)\n- Peak Design Wash Pouch \n- Small tripod (Ulanzi F38)\nWhen my travel includes fishing I bring a  small fishing rod (stored length 55cm) and a small plano box with me. This items should also fit in the Eagle Creek Explore.  \n\n\nAccording to this information, what would you suggest? Do you  maybe have experience with the Eagle Creek Explore 26?  \n\nThanks.",

I usually use it for hiking or bringing my laptop + other stuff to work. Also a fan of having so many pockets easily accessible (front hip strap pockets, both side zip-up pockets, etc). \n\nThe Patagonia on the other hand, does not feel like it'll be easy on the shoulders for the long-haul, not does it have hip strap pockets. Though its infinetely better for keeping this organized/accessible once arrived at accomodations. We'll be staying at Casa particular's in a few cities/towns so will be on the move quite a bit.\n\nWhich would you take?",

I've been one-bagging out of a 22L bag I've had since high school and got to looking for a new bag after a recent international trip. ~~Spain was rough on it~~ Me in Spain was rough on it, but it's been with me daily for almost eight years now. In person I actually like the BH's finish...it's different and it's own vibe, especially in this navy/orange color pair 😘\n\nI've been searching for a bag that would triple for EDC, hiking, and minimal one-bagging. I wanted an Ultra Dragonfly, but I just can't afford it right now. The REI Rucksack 28 seemed like a good fit (especially when on sale), but after trying it I didn't like how it wore and the side pocket things.\n\nI was planning on waiting out for Black Friday to maybe grab a Mystery Ranch Catalyst 26 or the new Patagonia Black Hole 25L, but with retailers clearing out stock of the previous model of the BH, I thought I'd try it out. I'll test pack it with my packing list from Spain over the weekend, but I've clocked some miles today with it and I'm pretty happy with it.\n\nI'm 6'5\", so the height of the bag works well for me, and I love the slim profile. I'm concerned it's tall for flight travel, but I'm willing to risk it or just plan on using an old bag if I'm flying on a strict airline.\n\nHoping this is going to be a win for me 🤞 I previously invested in some ~~top notch~~ Amazon Basics packing cubes to help when traveling—though if you've got experience with this bag I'm open to packing cube suggestions!",

Glossy surface = tougher for bacteria to form biofilm and easy for us to clean.\n\nOnly drawback is visible scratches. Can any long time user comment on how bad the scratches are?",

I am female, 170cm tall and thin / small upper body frame (I wear size xs from all brands). \n\nWhat I like:\nThe bag fits a lot, more than what I expect a 32L bag to hold. There are good and balanced compartments, so nothing is too cluttered but at the same time I retain flexibility re how I want to pack the bag. \n\nWhat I realize after using the bag for a day (involving a decent amount of walking):\nIt ends up being heavier than what I expected. I did not fill it to the brim, and I do have 1 laptop and 1 iPad in there (everything totaling 7kg). For my frame, I don’t think I could really onebag with more than 7kg. The shoulder strap is alright, there is a chest strap that helps a little, but waist straps are missing and would be nice. The bag sits alright on me, it looks like a big bag (bigger than day pack) but nothing too big (not like a mega camping bag). The bottom of the bag sits comfortably above my butt and the top just around my shoulders. ",

The plastic coating of the fabric is starting to peel off, so it’s time to start thinking about a replacement. Since I use the bicycle everyday regardless of the weather, I need a (at least reliably rainproof) waterproof backpack for ecd, travelling etc. I know I could just use a rain cover but that‘s a hassle and I‘d like to avoid that.\nI‘ve been looking at waterproof rolltop backpacks, but they usually only have one big and one smaller compartment and that would make organisation of my stuff a nightmare since I carry a lot of small shit around everyday, like SAK, medicine, flashlight, bike lights, chargers etc.\n\nNow I‘m looking for a replacement. My requirements are:\nWaterproof/rainproof\n30-40l\nsmaller compartments for organisation\npadded compartment for ipad/laptop\npreferrably black\n\n\nDo you have any recommendations/experiences?\n\n",
