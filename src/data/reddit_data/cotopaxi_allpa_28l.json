Wife forgot the Allpa hip strap at home and with all the walking we did, it was harder to carry the bag without it. Hip straps make a difference. I could have hiked a mountain with the Farpoint.\n2. The wire frame of the Farpoint will limit the bag in some bins. But the small plane we had with GOL gave me comfort knowing it should go in almost any bin.\n3. The compression straps on the Farpoint are very handy! \n4. The Allpa 35L could almost fit under a seat in some planes. Even though the GOL 737-800 bin was small, the life vests are stored in the bulkhead so you can store more under the seat since you don't have the storage bin for the life vest.\n5. Nobody gave our bags any notice. We were standing right in front of a GOL baggage checker who was picking people out to measure bags and he didn't even notice the Allpa on my wife's back.\n6. The tacky surface of the Allpa means you will have trouble in the airlines sizing frame. We could not slide it into the Air Canada sizing frame when we tested it.\n\nWe are both very happy with our purchases. Both bags were perfect for us and we would recommend them to anyone.",

The compression straps on the Farpoint are very handy! \n4. The Allpa 35L could almost fit under a seat in some planes. Even though the GOL 737-800 bin was small, the life vests are stored in the bulkhead so you can store more under the seat since you don't have the storage bin for the life vest.\n5.

            "body": "Our travels through Brazil with the Cotopaxi Allpa 35L and Osprey Farpoint 40L (2022 version) were beyond expectations. \n\nSome lessons learned:\n\n1. Wife forgot the Allpa hip strap at home and with all the walking we did, it was harder to carry the bag without it. Hip straps make a difference. I could have hiked a mountain with the Farpoint.\n2. The wire frame of the Farpoint will limit the bag in some bins. But the small plane we had with GOL gave me comfort knowing it should go in almost any bin.\n3. The compression straps on the Farpoint are very handy! \n4. The Allpa 35L could almost fit under a seat in some planes. Even though the GOL 737-800 bin was small, the life vests are stored in the bulkhead so you can store more under the seat since you don't have the storage bin for the life vest.\n5. Nobody gave our bags any notice. We were standing right in front of a GOL baggage checker who was picking people out to measure bags and he didn't even notice the Allpa on my wife's back.\n6. The tacky surface of the Allpa means you will have trouble in the airlines sizing frame. We could not slide it into the Air Canada sizing frame when we tested it.\n\nWe are both very happy with our purchases. Both bags were perfect for us and we would recommend them to anyone.",

After months in the lead up to the trip (our tickets included checked-in luggage so we had both options open) eventually we compromised on her bringing the cabin-size suitcase to bring as carry-on instead of a backpack. In the end she enjoyed being handsfree carrying just her travel handbag handling all our important documents. I had the Allpa 28 strapped semi-awkwardly onto the suitcase handle but it worked most of the time. Wifey also packed a lot of medicine which came in handy as we both fell ill in the middle of our trip, so she's the MVP! She'll happily OneBag again.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHonestly, the best part of OneBagging for me is just knowing how little you actually need to bring to holidays. Unpacking was so easy as well which is another point of mental fatigue I can do without. Big thanks to everyone on this sub in sharing their knowledge and experiences!\n\nAMA :)",

Packing List\n\n**Drawstring Bag**\n\n* [Cabeau Air Evolution](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/product/B084B1C7WW) inflatable neck pillow\n* [Cabeau Air TNE](https://www.amazon.com.au/Cabeau-Inflatable-Lightweight-Customized-Adjustable/dp/B0C5N9YYTY) inflatable neck pillow\n* [Theragun Mini](https://www.therabody.com/anz/en-au/theragun-mini.html) Massage Gun \n* [Vapur 700ml](https://www.amazon.com.au/Vapur-Eclipse-Foldable-Flexible-Carabiner/dp/B00BI9AM1Y) collapsible water bottle\n* Selfie Stick\n\nTech Kit\n\n* [SoundPEATS T3](https://www.amazon.com.au/SoundPEATS-T3-Canceling-Headphones-Transparency/dp/B09BZM25Y3) ANC Earbuds\n* [VEEKTOMX Mini](https://www.amazon.com.au/VEEKTOMX-10000mAh-Ultra-Compact-Portable-External/dp/B09C8CFKLJ?th=1) Power Bank 10000mAh\n* LENCENT Universal Travel Adapter\n* Adaptor &amp; USB-C cord\n* Flight Airplane Phone Holder Mount\n\n**Cotopaxi Allpa 28**\n\nElectronics\n\n* Lenovo Yoga 14\" Laptop\n* Wireless Mouse\n* Mousepad\n\nClothing\n\n* 7x T-shirts\n* 6x Shorts\n* 5x Socks (Underarmor/Stance)\n* 6x Undies\n* Worn on plane: Long-sleeve, trackpants, Hokka runners)\n\nToiletry Bag\n\n* Hairwax\n* Electric Toothbrush\n* Cologne\n* Skincream\n* Skin Serum\n* Electric Shaver\n* Nailclipper\n\nOther\n\n* [Sea to Summit Dry Sack](https://www.sherpa.com.au/sea-to-summit-view-dry-sack-8l) 8L\n* [Tirtyl](https://tirtyl.com.au/products/laundry-detergent-sheets) Laundry Detergent Sheets\n* [Columbia 21L Packable Tote](https://www.amazon.com.au/Columbia-Mens-Lightweight-Packable-Tote/dp/B081P3444T)\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* The [Kathmandu Packing Cell](https://www.amazon.com.au/Kathmandu-Packing-Compression-Travel-Storage/dp/B085L26R8Q) (Purple/Magenta) compressed really well which I needed to make sure I can close the Allpa 28 which has been a minor issue generally from users.\n* **Favourite Item**\n   * Massage gun (great after a long day) but it will cost 500grams of weight\n* [Go-To Face hero Oil](https://www.mecca.com/en-au/go-to/face-hero-30ml-I-038679) Flights dehydrate my face like nothing so using this was a lifesaver\n* **Did not use as much**\n   * Flight Phone Holder - was incompatible\n   * 2x Shirts &amp; 2x Shorts - I underestimated how quick they dried and how often I'd use my more favourite ones. I shipped the less-used ones back home mid-trip\n* **Allpa 28** Loved the look, handles were great and the size allowed me to restrict what I should bring. The lack of a bottle holder didn't bother me as I was pretty sufficiently hydrated from restaurants/hotel. I only ever used the vapur bottle to bring water from the airport into the plane so I don't need to ask the flight attendant frequently. I did wish it had a suitcase-handle strap so I can slide it on easily. I used the waist straps instead to put onto my wife's carry on roller.\n* Laptop - Just a note, I used this bag domestically for work and the Dell XPS 17\" Laptop fits fine as it's a relatively slim laptop.\n* **Carry-on Restrictions:** We went through the departing Airports of Melbourne, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Kuala Lumpur. Our carryon bags were sometimes 9.7kg (and my drawstring was 3kg)*.* The issues we encountered was in Kuala Lumpur where they weighed everyone's main bag before having our bags scanned. We just redistributed the items onto our personal bag and passed with 8.2kg. Another minor one was at Seoul (Incheon) where we arrived 80 minutes before departure but a quick redistribution and the check-in desk attendant was fine with it.\n* We did a fair bit of shopping so we took on the challenge to ship things from Korea as there was no way to bring it to the rest of our holiday.\n* **Lessons for next time** We had to bring a laptop purely for a job application the wife had (which she got in the end) but without the laptop and the items I didn't need, we should be able to downsize even more.\n\n**Bag Experience &amp; Convincing The Other**\n\nI know it's a topic amongst OneBag enthusiasts to try to convince their SO to do the same. After months in the lead up to the trip (our tickets included checked-in luggage so we had both options open) eventually we compromised on her bringing the cabin-size suitcase to bring as carry-on instead of a backpack. In the end she enjoyed being handsfree carrying just her travel handbag handling all our important documents. I had the Allpa 28 strapped semi-awkwardly onto the suitcase handle but it worked most of the time. Wifey also packed a lot of medicine which came in handy as we both fell ill in the middle of our trip, so she's the MVP! She'll happily OneBag again.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHonestly, the best part of OneBagging for me is just knowing how little you actually need to bring to holidays. Unpacking was so easy as well which is another point of mental fatigue I can do without. Big thanks to everyone on this sub in sharing their knowledge and experiences!\n\nAMA :)",

I’m 5’1 and would like something with clamshell design and good back support for backpacking during trips. I will be using this bag as my carry on bag during travels. \n\nI’m torn with the two since I like the organization structure of Cotopaxi ($170 for Allpa and $165 for Del Dia - they also said Del Dia is better as Allpa wears more easily due to its plastic like material) but it’s more expensive than this Osprey model ($110).\n\nThank you!",

So far, the following differences vs old were observed:\n\n* Added: Small front zipper pocket, it's pretty shallow, but deep enough for a passport, glasses, phone.\n* Added: Luggage handle pass-through. As a result, there is now a vertical air channel on back padding\n* Changed: Vinyl coating feels much less rubbery than on the old version. I like the new coating better.\n* Removed: There is no more side access to the main compartment (see picture)\n* Changed(?): The water bottle pocket mesh seems a bit stretchier, so may fit a larger bottle\n* Changed: MSRP is now $250\n\nGenerally, I like the changes, except for the price increase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hghpmz868qfd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d750a38838614ec161d1c1be96dbea9c4e572e70",

I noticed that when fully packed, the Allpa was extremely hard to zip.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idnwd7b7lwka1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdfea3e37e6f1e6106636e08972533624dc4c4ab\n\nObviously I have some work to do to streamline this set up and avoid this zipping issue. I plan on trying out the Fairview 40L to compare it with the Allpa 28L next!\n\n## *Ways I Could Downsize My Current Set Up\n\nWhile I've been happy with most of what I've packed, there are a few ways I think I could downsize even further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. While I love my **hiking shoes**, they are quite heavy and I wonder if they could be replaced with some sporty sneakers.\n2. My **Portable Power Bank** is a tank, it works amazingly well for multiple fast charges. This gives me peace of mind that I'll never have a dead phone mid-travel. However, it is *heavy.* Since I only need one extra charge a day, I could have gone with a lighter power bank.\n3. **Bose Noise Cancelling headphones** are huge space eaters, and I only use them during transit. I didn't want to shell out for in-ear noise cancelling headphones, but I find myself wishing I had those instead to take up less space. Still, they have served me well so far that I keep them around even though they take up so much space.\n4. I brought **one packing cube**, but the Cotopaxi Allpa already has three sections that are divided by zippered mesh pockets. I don't get the packing cube hype, and mine is not particularly light so I would like to get rid of it.\n5. **Birkenstocks** are comfy and fun but they take up so much space. Worse still, they are leather and shouldn't get wet. I plan to downsize to Xeros, a barefoot sandal that can weather the water and squish down for packing. Then I can also get rid of the flip flops!\n6. Anywhere I have **two** things, I could probably just have one and be fine.\n7. I still haven't used the water purifier even once, much to my chagrin.\n\nAnyway, thanks to this community for inspiring me to keep it light on world adventures! I've been to 5 countries so far in 4 months.",

Please consider sharing to r/heronebag too!\n\n If you like the comfort of Birks but not the issues with the cork/leather models, they make some in foam/plastic and they're fantastic. To me, their support and comfort is worth the space they take up. Then you could ditch the flip flops.\n\nFor hiking footwear, obviously it depends on what you're actually doing, but likely a pair of hiking sneakers (like from Salomon) would do the trick. They have ankle-height models too if that's a criteria. \n\nI feel like you could pare your clothing down, especially bottoms. After so many months on the road, what pieces are you not using as much? I'm asking mostly for my own curiosity because it might be eye-opening to me too!\n\nI love my Bose headphones so I completely understand why you're carrying them.

            "body": "On the Xero sandals. Read recent reviews. I have a pair that are a few years old, and they are holding up well. But recent reviews in their own site show delaminating and strap wear.\nUntil they have this under control, I’d get them early and  test them. Especially in wet conditions.  Or skip altogether. \nI was a Chaco for life sort, but Xero hit my weight sweet spot, for sure. And the flip flops can go, if Xero work for you.\n\nChaco is a non barefoot option, that allows a good amount of hiking. (I’ve done some in Canyonlands, but they don’t work for Grand Canyon. They were great in Jamaica in the mountains, and I go into the Rockies with them. (My three pairs are all from the Paonia, CO years, pre Chinese factory. My oldest pair is from 1998. I’ve had a few new soles. I have one in rotation at a time.)\n\nWill they replace the hiking *boots* in your photo? 70 percent. Trail runners might do better. Take a peek at r/ultralight for ideas.\n\nChacos seem a bit lighter than my Birkenstock Arizonas (a gift, and before Chaco, all I wore.)\n\nXero caught my attention as an ultralight option to Chacos.\n\nI have considered Bedrocks. But they seem bulky visually. Since I wear Chaco and Xero in dressier situations, I wanted that all but cocktail dress option. (Huh, I’ve gone to two weddings in the past two years and wore Birks both times. I guess they are my “heels.”)",

                "body": "I have the Xero Z-Trail sandals and love them. I wear them all summer around town, on backpacking trips, and when traveling. They are incredibly thin and light. However, I did have to process a return with an earlier pair because the Velcro stopped sticking after about eight months. Support was pretty good about replacing them and I’ll see how this new pair holds up. Xero mentioned they changed material so it should be better. I’ve found a way to slip them on-off so I don’t have to do the Velcro every time and I think that helps. TLDR: Great sandals, some quality issues (but company was great about swap) \n\nAs far as trail runners go I highly recommend Altra Lone Peaks. I live in them in the summer while backpacking in the PNW. They have great grip and feel like you are hiking in slippers (they are so comfy!). I vastly prefer them to the old clunky leather hiking boots I used to wear. \n\nIf you want something less active that straddles the line between city/hiking I recommend the Lems brand, specifically the Mesa.",

My significant other is 6'4\" and he has the same bag and it looks like an everyday sized backpack on him.  We had a bad experience previously because they made us check a different backpack before bc it \"looked\" big to the agent.  He didn't have us measure it and just told me we'd have to pay off we wanted to bring it.  We had a crying toddler with us and didn't press the issue (though we should've). Thanks in advance!",

So even it if it was slightly over stuffed, we could've put things into our checked luggage. I felt like he purposely waited it until he put the suitcase onto the conveyor behind him and then told us we would need to pay even more for the backpack. We weren't the only ones he hassled. Another woman behind us had a small underseat roller and they ended up arguing. I saw her at the gate and she said they ended up getting a manager and measuring it. She won lol.",

If you're in the aisle seat,  the underseat space is about 3. 5 inches narrower than the middle or window seat.  If you have an Allpa, don't pack it too full towards the top as i had to smush mine. Also, no problems with agents in PIT. In Key West, they were super strict and at least 3 agents were there to ask you to combine your items into one if you didn't purchase a carry on. No exceptions.  If your bag is questionable,  pay the carry on fee.",

(The site says 13”-15”, but my 16” fit just fine).",
