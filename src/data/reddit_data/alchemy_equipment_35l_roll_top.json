From 40L 2 years ago to 35L last year to this 30 L. Main features:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvzqfsvzekse1.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83a44abd622837e2ee96fb05cce5015c3e8faa69\n\n* Two external quick access zip pockets (you can see one with sunglass and the other with map in this pic). The top one has two non-zip internal pockets too and a key/lanyard hook\n* Dedicated chamber at the bottom, which I use to store snacks, waterproof toiletry pouch etc. One can store dirty clothes there, or extra footwear.\n* The main compartment is very spacious; two fully packed packing cubes can easily fit in with space to spare. I love the slotted zip design of main compartment instead of the suitcase style. Slanted zipper allows quick retrieval of packing cubes from the bag and no need to find a flat surface to open.\n* Bungee cord system (elastic webbing) in front is a huge plus; I use it to store wet towel, rain jacket etc\n* Triangular Clip attachment strip in front (not visible in image as this area is where the bag flap is folded); for attaching [rechargeable USB light](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8560549/cycling-light-rear-usb-cl100) while riding bike/walking in night etc\n* Chest and Hip straps\n* Dual zips are super smooth, but not YKK.\n* Additional zippered Internal secure pocket in main compartment to store essentials\n* Hydration Bladder compatible; bladder compartment has thick padding/cushioning suitable for laptop too.\n* External loops for hiking pole\n* Reflective loops in shoulder straps\n* Two bottle cages with deep pockets and straps that absolutely secures my 1.5L Nalgene Everyday Wide Mouth X 2 bottles on either side. The bottle straps also act as compression straps for the bag, so even when fully packed, the bag won't bulge out, an important aesthetic feature I really like.\n* The back panel is thickly padded with excellent ventillation\n* Dimensions passable as an under-seat laptop bag for budget EU/Asian airlines\n* Very inexpensive and very high volume to gram ratio (30L for 815g)\n* Sustainability: Decathlon offers repair service for this bag in their stores.\n\nWish future iterations of this bag offer:\n\n* Lockable zip (for hostel stays, for instance)\n* Padded hip belt. The current one is very basic\n* More reflective elements in front of the bag\n* Water resistance; but please, no PFOA/PFOS treatment. I use a waterproof cover, and its fine, too.",

Changes the dynamic and CG of the bike.   Can you arrange it so things are lower?  Maybe some side bags?\n\nI’m finding the more often I go, the less I bring.  The first time I went motocamping I was prepared for the apocalypse.  Now I’m just ready for rain, minor repairs, and\nFlat tires.",

                "body": "I just bought a dualsport so haven't started moto camping yet but I have experience bikepacking, skipacking, and regular backpacking and have gotten things pretty minimalist. Part of that is having lightweight and compact gear, but some of it is also just things like bringing a much smaller and lighter sleeping bag that isn't very warm and just wearing thermal base layers to bed to compensate. Cutting your sleeping bag size/weight in half is a huge one",

            "body": "Maybe post your current packing list, if you have time? We can offer more specific feedback from there.\n\nI go super minimalist.  The camp-specific part of my load out is just sleeping pad, sleeping bag, tent, and inflatable pillow. That all fits in two 10L dry bags mounted on a homemade soft rack based on the Green Chile ADV design. My toolkit fits in two 1L crash bar bags.  Spare tubes, tire levers, and trail stand fit in a small tail bag by dirt-bike-gear.com.  My tank bag (Enduristan 4X) holds snacks, chapstick, a small battery pack, and visor cleaning stuff.  I wear an Uswe Patriot with a 3L reservoir for water and my food for the day, plus a trauma kit and small first aid kit.\n\nI don’t carry a cook set because I don’t like the weight, bulk, and mess of cooking. I find the best food I can on the road. Gas station food is a last resort - I look for grocery stores when I can find them. I only carry 1 day of food at a time because it’s easy to restock in small towns when refueling.  Caffeine gives me migraines so I’m not worried about coffee.  \n\nI wear Merino wool under my gear and it easily goes 3 sweaty days with minimal smell. Most trips I don’t need to carry spare clothes besides maybe a pair of extra socks and underwear. \n\nFor toiletries, I just carry floss, a travel toothbrush, and travel toothpaste. I use a deodorant called Lavilin that uses some crazy alchemy to last for a solid week. It sounds crazy but it really works.  I also carry a few shower wipes for a stripper bath every night and a little bottle of hand sanitizer to kill foot funk.  \n\nI don’t carry a chair. If I want to sit around camp, I park my bike so I can lean on the front wheel, which to me is honestly really comfortable. I know this is probably crazy to a lot of people but after 30 years of camping experience I’ve accepted that I don’t like campfires. They make everything stink, they take a ton of work to build and maintain, and they mess up my sinuses for days breathing the smoke.  That means I don’t need a hatchet or saw. I don’t really even need a knife. I have heavy duty paramedic shears in my trauma kit that handle the rare situation where I need to cut stuff. \n\nMy whole setup, including the weight of the luggage itself, weighs just under 26 pounds. I like my bike to ride like it’s unloaded, and with this setup, I can’t feel any difference and don’t have to baby it. For me, this makes sense, because I’m out there to ride, and camping is just a cheap way to sleep.",
