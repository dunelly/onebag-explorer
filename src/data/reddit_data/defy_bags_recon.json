I over engineered pretty much every aspect of it and made sure it held my hanging weight for no reason whatsoever.

Not Tom Bihn Synik well thought out, but it also looks more slick. \n\nI love xpac which is the main reason I went for the bag. I also went for the bag because I heard it’s really comfortable, it is. \n\nMy biggest gripe is that the craftsmanship is a little lacking, loose threads and uneven stitching in some areas. \n\nMy main intention for this bag is to use it for shorter hikes and ocasional travel. It won’t be an edc bag for me. In that capacity, I think the bag is excellent. \n\nTL;DR: Amazing pockets, great materials. But the quality could be better. But I do think it’s a really nice pack and I’m glad I gave it.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1esmays/still_searching_for_the_perfect_bag/",
        "selftext": "I’ve been on the search for the perfect bag and haven’t nailed it yet but I’m hoping you guys have some suggestions. Just for context, I’m a 29M that works in IT and travels fairly often. I don’t commute on public transit and I keep my edc fairly minimal and compact. Here is a brief summary of the bags I own and my personal opinion on each one.\n\nTAD Axiom 24: My first big bag purchase. Loved it and it was my daily for over a year but soon left me wanting for something with better feeling materials and less bulk. Admin pocket on the front is probably my favorite feature and the side “water bottle” pockets are great for long term storage of stuff I rarely need and don’t want in the way. \n\nNutsac Satchel 15: Great materials and feel. Organization is heavily pouch/organizer based and I tried but it wasn’t for me. Might be a me thing but the shoulder strap pulled on my clothes and was uncomfortable.\n\nBlack Ember Forge 20: similar issue to the nutsac when in satchel mode so I never used it like that. Backpack mode carried fairly well but it always felt small on me. Organization was great. Materials also solid. The layout definitely favors the satchel mode so things would often shift while carrying in backpack mode.\n\nFilson Journeyman: materials were great but felt like a $150 to $200 bag with a $200 logo. Lacking organization and looked a bit weird when it wasn’t fully packed out and sat very far off the back when it was. \n\nTAD Axiom S2 WX: My favorite work/get sh*t done bag. Organization is great to set next to me and have all tools and gear readily available. Materials are incredibly durable(almost too much) and it has the same pockets I loved on the original Axiom 24. The downsides are that the back panel definitely takes some breaking in and is almost too stiff. I’ve heavily considered removing the plastic sheet in the back just so it conforms to my back a little better. Straps are all over the place and I use Velcro to tame them but it’s worth mentioning. It is also a fairly heavy bag. \n\nArktype dashpack: I love this bag for everyday carry. It is just floppy and slim enough to sits perfectly on your back without feeling like it’s pulling you off balance. There is basically no floppy anything on it so it’s great for the motorcycle. Back laptop compartment feels like an after thought and completely ruins the comfort of the bag when used. Luckily they also added an internal drop style laptop sleeve and using that makes a world of difference. Front zipper pocket is terrible. One single strand of elastic with varying sizes that are too big for pens but too small for anything larger. You could use them for cables but good luck not going insane every time you try to put them back in. Interior organization in the main pocket is great and gives you a few pockets to keep things accessible but out of the way. \n\nSo that leads to my “grail” bag that I have yet to find. From what I’ve used and what I dislike and like about the bags, here is my perfect bag:\n\nForm factor: 16-20L and carry’s close to the back\n\nMaterials: Traditional canvas that isn’t too heavy or stiff\n\nSturdiness: Decent padding on back but still conforms to spine\n\nPockets: front admin pocket with organization that opens downwards and presents everything in it like the axiom. A top “sunglass” pocket is also very desired for things like keys, AirPods, flash drives, and general dump.  I also don’t care if the laptop sleeve is its own dedicated pocket or just a padded sleeve in the main pocket. \n\nWater bottle: I don’t care if it has water bottle pockets or not.\n\nStraps: the axiom straps are too thick. Arktype and Filson are very close to perfect. \n\nExtra “nice to haves”: leather accents on the bottom similar to the nutsac for durability would be great. I also tend to use the external webbing for random things whether it’s on the back of the Arktype or the straps on the Axiom.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions on the next pack I should try. Love you. ",
