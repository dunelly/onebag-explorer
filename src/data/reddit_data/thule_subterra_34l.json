Based on my research on this subreddit i decided to go for Patagonia MLC, Osprey daylite and Thule compression cubes for my one week trip to Peru.\n\n## Gear\n- *Thule large compression cube*\n  1. 4 cotton t-shirts \n  2. 3 Uniqlo’s airism t-shirts \n  3. Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket\n  4. One towel \n  5. 2 Lululemon ABC pants\n  6. 1 zipper lock bag containing medicines \n\n- *Thule small compression cube*\n  1. 6 Jockey underwear \n  2. 1 decathlon pant rain cover \n  3. 1 Nike short \n\n- *Patagonial MLC*\n  1. Compressed Thule compression cubes (See details above)\n  2. 1 pair of Birkenstock sandals\n  3. 1 backpack rain cover\n  4. 1 osprey daylite packed flat at the bottom. I used it for 1 day excursions in Peru and to pack gifts and souvenirs from Peru.\n  5. One book, cables and chargers in tech compartment (Not shown in images)\n\nIt was comfortable to carry the Patagonia MLC as a backpack, and I didn’t face any issues. However, it was not comfortable to carry it as a cross-body bag, as the entire weight of the bag was on one shoulder. During my travel with LATAM Airlines, it fit perfectly under the seat, and I wasn’t called out to stow it as a carry-on bag. \n\nOverall, I am happy with my purchase of the entire gear, and I am looking forward to my next trip.",

Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket\n  4. One towel \n  5. 2 Lululemon ABC pants\n  6. 1 zipper lock bag containing medicines \n\n- *Thule small compression cube*\n  1. 6 Jockey underwear \n  2. 1 decathlon pant rain cover \n  3. 1 Nike short \n\n- *Patagonia **mini** MLC* ([Product link](https://www.patagonia.com/product/black-hole-mini-mlc-convertible-backpack-30-liters/195699382879.html))\n  1. Compressed Thule compression cubes (See details above)\n  2. 1 pair of Birkenstock sandals\n  3. 1 backpack rain cover\n  4. 1 osprey daylite packed flat at the bottom. I used it for 1 day excursions in Peru and to pack gifts and souvenirs from Peru.\n  5. One book, cables and chargers in tech compartment (Not shown in images)\n\nIt was comfortable to carry the Patagonia mini MLC as a backpack, and I didn’t face any issues. However, it was not comfortable to carry it as a cross-body bag, as the entire weight of the bag was on one shoulder. During my travel with LATAM Airlines, it fit perfectly under the seat, and I wasn’t called out to stow it as a carry-on bag. \n\nOverall, I am happy with my purchase of the entire gear, and I am looking forward to my next trip.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow bag ~~addicts~~ enthusiasts! I recently came across the Thule Subterra Hybrid 2 and was really taken with it as a potential flexible use personal-item sized bag. I didn’t see any review posts or anyone really mentioning it so I thought I’d post up with my first impressions having just gotten it in today. \n\nIt’s touted as expandable from a 15L pack to a 23L pack and has a full wrap around zip on the main clamshell compartment, which actually allows it to function similar to a compression packing cube if wanted.\nThe back pack straps can be stashed and it has a luggage pass through strap, which was one of my requirements.\nThere are two compartments: a clamshell open \n“travel pack” main open compartment, and a padded 3/4 zip panel compartment with organization for tech items including a laptop, tablet, charging cords, etc.\n\nI was surprised how much I could fit in the main travel section! I have a 4-day conference coming up at the end of May that I’m working on a capsule wardrobe for, and I fit just about everything in. I started with the compartment expanded and then zipped it up compression cube style after packing. I have more space to fill if I leave it expanded, and I haven’t loaded anything into the tech/organization side yet. It still feels like there’s plenty more room.\n\nWhat I fit so far:\nToiletry kit\nTravel hair care products \nSmall Orange packing cube has 2 bras and 4 pairs underware\n1 pair skinny jeans\n1 pair light weight capris(LLBean camping quick dry material)\n1 pair shorts\n3 tops\n1 tshirt &amp; 1 pair scrub pants for pjs\n\nI really like the size and weight, the material looks and feels good, and the large handles on the side let you carry it sort of briefcase style.\n\nI do wish it had a messenger bag like strap or attach points  for another carry option, but that’s a minor thing.\n\nIt doesn’t have an external water bottle pocket, but currently with the bag not loaded to capacity you could fit one inside.\n\nI can report back after actually using it for travel, but so far I’m really pleased with my purchase. Hope these ramblings and pics are helpful for folks, particularly if you, like me, had tried to find commentary on this bag.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow bag ~~addicts~~ enthusiasts! I recently came across the Thule Subterra Hybrid 2 and was really taken with it as a potential flexible use personal-item sized bag. I didn’t see any review posts or anyone really mentioning it so I thought I’d post up with my first impressions having just gotten it in today. \n\nIt’s touted as expandable from a 15L pack to a 23L pack and has a full wrap around zip on the main clamshell compartment, which actually allows it to function similar to a compression packing cube if wanted.\nThe back pack straps can be stashed and it has a luggage pass through strap, which was one of my requirements.\nThere are two compartments: a clamshell open \n“travel pack” main open compartment, and a padded 3/4 zip panel compartment with organization for tech items including a laptop, tablet, charging cords, etc.\n\nI was surprised how much I could fit in the main travel section! I have a 4-day conference coming up at the end of May that I’m working on a capsule wardrobe for, and I fit just about everything in. I started with the compartment expanded and then zipped it up compression cube style after packing. I have more space to fill if I leave it expanded, and I haven’t loaded anything into the tech/organization side yet. It still feels like there’s plenty more room.\n\nWhat I fit so far:\nToiletry kit\nTravel hair care products \nSmall Orange packing cube has 2 bras and 4 pairs underware\n1 pair skinny jeans\n1 pair light weight capris(LLBean camping quick dry material)\n1 pair shorts\n3 tops\n1 tshirt &amp; 1 pair scrub pants for pjs\n\nI really like the size and weight, the material looks and feels good, and the large handles on the side let you carry it sort of briefcase style.\n\nI do wish it had a messenger bag like strap or attach points  for another carry option, but that’s a minor thing.\n\nIt doesn’t have an external water bottle pocket, but currently with the bag not loaded to capacity you could fit one inside.\n\nI can report back after actually using it for travel, but so far I’m really pleased with my purchase. Hope these ramblings and pics are helpful for folks, particularly if you, like me, had tried to find commentary on this bag.",

Basically the size of Aer city pack pro which is 24L, stowable strap and slick minimal design. This bag can easily replace aer city pack 15L, aer flight pack 3 20L and aer pro pack 24L.

So far I agree, great for travel not quite sure how I would feel taking it on the trail. I’ve mostly been using mine in the car as well, some limited time carrying it on my back, but it’s been super comfy and easy to carry. I cannot get over how much this thing can hold. Did you use the laptop compartment for anything?",

This combination was an elegant solution for my needs. I was able to fit everything I needed for an upcoming 10-day trip.\n\nIn the medium cube, I was able to get 3 shirts, 2 shorts, hiking pants, swimming trunks, a base layer, a fleece, and a rain jacket.\n\nIn the smaller cube, I fit 5 pairs of socks, 4 underwear, sleeping shorts, and a sleeping shirt.\n\nThis allowed me to use the left side of the bag to fit a pair of Tevas, a belt, a beanie, a hat, and a pair of 8x32 binoculars. I stowed toiletries in the top.\n\nThe bag zipped up nicely and was not too bulky. Highly recommend this combination!",

        "selftext": "Dark Slate version\nI’ve been testing this bag for a week, and generally happy about it.\nSize is 15L, expands to about 23L. If I fit my daily stuff in there, the bag is packed to the brim (14’’ MBP, lunch box, midsize tech organizer, some pens, water bottle, and a Switch with the Satisfye Grip, makes it way bigger than just the Switch).\nExpanded the bucket can contain 1 mid and 1 small packing cube (Osprey for reference).\n\nPros:\n- Clean look, used as a brief it looks professional, used as a backpack too \n- Fabric is easy to clean and not a lint magnet\n- Straps are surprisingly well padded\n\nCons:\n- Laptop compartment is so densely padded, that adding more will dent into the bucket\n- No dedicated water bottle pocket, but that’s what you get with a clean look like this\n- No messenger strap or hooks to attach one\n\nDirect competitors: Aer City Pack (probably better padding, Alpaka Tech Brief Pro. Where the Thule really shines is that it probably has the better fabric (not considering the X-Pac version). ",

        "selftext": "The chest strap to my overnight camping bag (Thule Versant 60L mens) is attached by the clip in the first image being secured to the “slidy thing” on the shoulder strap in the second and third image. The chest strap adjusts by sliding it up and down the shoulder strap with the clip in image 1. My shoulder strap clip fell off, and now the bag is difficult to use without trying to rig up some kind of alternate chest strap (like tying a small bit of rope with a taut-line hitch to the shoulder straps - not ideal) \n\nFor the life of me, I cannot get the slit in the chest strap attachment to open wide enough to reattach the chest strap to the “slidy thing” on the shoulder straps. I have no idea what to do! I know my description is garbage, so let me know if clarification is needed. Any tips are appreciated!",

Also, you can use something like needle nose pliers or flat head screwdriver to widen the top of that clip where it’ll go onto the bottom of the tubing like the previous comment describes. It’ll probably leave a mark on the clip but if you’re desperate, it’s better than nothing. I typically like to bring a multitool with pliers (like a Leatherman) with me any time I use a pack with this style of clip. Additionally, squeeze it back together once it’s back on the tubing. Not just the widened part, but the whole thing. Makes this less likely to happen in the future!",

See both my pros and cons. \n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L\n\nPros \n- fits my torso (as a 5ft 2in woman)\n- has a removable hip belt\n- heavy duty, nice quality materials\n- was able to snag for $170\n- has nice zippered compartments on the inside to keep everything organized \n\nCons\n- it sits a little bit high on my shoulders and leaves a big gap between the back of my neck and the back top of the bag. Not sure if that’s how it’s supposed to fit but I don’t know if I like that. \n- the coating on the front of the bag seems like it could peel or scratch out down the line, as I’ve seen posted a few times. \n- no (quality) water bottle holder?? \n- the zippers are a pain, especially around the corners and in the top right.

It’s my workbackpack that looks sleek, is roomy enough for my edc pouch, laptop, lunchbox, work equipment, with room to spare. It withstands pouring rain well. And most importantly it’s SO comfortable. It’s similar to the comfort of the borealis (which was the only bag that’s really comfy to me). \n\n2. North face borealis woman: my travel one bag. It used to be my school bag, but I don’t like the look of the bungee cord. So I’d rather not use it for edc. But it can fit max 2 packing cube and toilet bag, which is all I need for a week long holiday. \n\n3. Kanken no 2 laptop: it’s both my work bag as casual bag. I’ve got two colors of the old as well as the updated version. (Thinking I should sell one…)\n\n4. Andar Addison backpack: a not so practical leather backpack. It’s mostly trendy, also thinking to replace this for a better leather backpack. \n\nIf anyone has questions about the thule subterra, fire away. I couldn’t find any more reviews of that backpack  ",

Since it has no zipper, if the access area of the main compartment shifted to the side, will there any leaked hole which may cause water go in? There's a small compartment at top after the flap fold up, is that big or very tight? Can it hold 2 hard drive and some small items? Every pockets seem use the main compartment area, so those small pockets can't be use if your main compartment too packed?\n\nStravan, this one the color looks good, but the material and the zipper strong enough to hold fully packed stuff/heavy pack if I want to short travel with it(at least no zipper issue from the review I read)? The side pockets seem too filmy compare to my crossover 25L, can it hold water bottle like those 1.25L Cocoa-Cola bottle? Will it loosely after months of use?\n\nPack n Pedal, This one cool! Waterproof! But how waterproof is IPX4? Is this suitable for what I use? The removable sleeve is useful for me though!\n\nWhich one do you think I should get?

The opinion of many bushcrafters and outdoorsmen is that 500D is plenty tough, and anything more is just added weight with vastly diminishing returns.\n\nFor example, my Vanquest IBEX 35 uses a similar strategy: 500D for all of the bag except for the bottom, which is 1000D.  It's known as a pretty tough bag for hiking and outdoors use.  I wouldn't go thicker for the rest of the bag, cause it's essentially just added weight with little purpose.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't go with more than 500D for most purposes.  The only situation I can think off where you'd want more, is if you plan on doing something with the bag that it wasn't designed for... like dragging it through a pile of sharp rocks, etc.\n\nAlso, you'll like the full zip front panel opening of the Stratoliner much more than a rolltop.  Just my opinion....",

Just the picks and sledge alone weigh a solid 10+lbs, plus water and snacks, my baseweight is close to 20lbs, then add in 10+ lbs of rocks, not to mention it routinely gets slid through caves and dropped in all sorts of environments.  I use it at least twice a week all summer long, for 2 years now, and if I wipe the dirt off it still looks brand new. \n\nThat said, I would chose a pack based on its functions, if you don’t like a roll top now, then you will probably hate a roll top after using it for a while.  Both TNF and Thule make really solid backpacks, so unless you’re planning on literally using it to haul rocks, go for the functional features you want, and don’t worry about the fabric.",

        "selftext": "I love bags, and I thought I had my holy grails: the [MEC Fast Track 40 L](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5038-084/fast-track-shoulder-bag) and the [Lululemon Go Getter Bag 25 L](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/accessories/Go-Getter-Bag-20/_/prod10370117?color=0001&amp;sz=ONESIZE).  \n\nA few weeks ago, I was casually browsing my local outdoor store, where I saw the Thule Subterra 2 40 L in Dark Slate.  I couldn't find any reviews online, but I noticed the Thule site had a 20% off sale.  I ordered one of each.  \n\nSince there weren't any reviews of the Subterra 2 line, I figured I could share my thoughts.  \n\n**About me**  \nFemale, 40s, 5'6\".  I use bags for casual travel (2 days to 2 weeks at a time).  I like to one bag it when I can.  \n\n**How I'm testing the bags**  \nSmall and Medium Peak Performance compression packing cubes.  Two toiletries bags (cosmetics and hair/body supplies).  Two pairs of shoes.  One Dyson hair dryer.  One hair straightener.  One 769 ml Yeti.  One 17\" laptop.  One tablet.\n\n**Thule 34 L**  \nInitial thoughts: There are enough reviews out there, so no one needs another one.  It was surprisingly comfortable.  The iridescent blue is beautiful, but I think the big reflective Thule logo is tacky.  The orange is garish but I could see how it would be helpful to find stuff in the bag.  I have my own packing cubes and wouldn't use the included one.  I think the roll-top would be annoying after a while, and I didn't like the deep \"black hole\" aspect of the bag.  \n\nWhy I am not keeping it: I have other bags that I prefer over this one.  \n\n**Subterra 2 21 L and 27 L backpacks**  \nInitial thoughts: Beautiful bags.  Quite comfortable (although the 21 L seemed to ride a bit higher on my shoulders).  Zippers are fantastic.  My laptop slides in and out of the slot easily.\n\nWhat I like: Clean and minimal design.  Lighter interior.  Padded straps.\n\nWhat I didn't like: I kind of wish it had an outside pocket on the front for extra storage (only because I'm used to it).\n\nWhat it fit (21 L): Laptop, tablet, both compression packing cubes.  I couldn't fit anything extra into the front pocket.  The Yeti fit into the side pocket.\n\nWhat it fit (27 L): Laptop, tablet, both compression packing cubes, and both cosmetics bags, with a bit of room to spare.  I could squeeze the hair dryer and straightener into the front pocket.  The Yeti fit into the side pocket.  If I took out the smaller compression packing cube, I could fit in a pair of shoes.  \n\nWhat am I keeping: I'm fighting the urge to keep both.  The 21 L is a bit sleeker, but I'm going to keep the 27 L because it has a tad more space.  \n\n**Subterra 2 40 L**  \nInitial thoughts: This is the bag I saw at the local store.  The colour is beautiful (and this is coming from someone who has black everything).\n\nWhat I like: It looks a bit more polished/professional than my MEC Fast Track.  There is some structure, so it's not a floppy bag.  There are plenty of organization pockets.  I actually really like the snap divider to keep things separate.  I thought it was packed tight, but when I put it on my back and things shifted down, I found I had an extra few litres of storage.  As an experiment, I tried putting the empty 27 L backpack into the laptop section (extra bag for souvenirs?) and it fit, but barely.  \n\nWhat I didn't like:  I wish it had internal compression straps like a suitcase.  The zipper divider flap feels flimsy.  I would rather two continuous zippers, instead of them meeting in the middle.  \n\nWhat it fit: Everything, with room to spare.\n\nWhy I am keeping it: I don't need it, but I like it.  It's got a lot of features my Fast Track doesn't have, including better organization, more pockets, improved strap storage, and a dedicated laptop sleeve.  It looks professional, and the logo isn't too in your face.  I fully admit that I do not need it, but it truly is a one and done bag.\n\n**Pictures**\n\n[Left: 21 L.

I have the 40L one myself, after having wanted the older style for a long time.\n\nI think you're being very generous with **There is some structure** I would say there is ALOT of structure. This bag stays as in a box shape even when completely unloaded.\n\nOne other thing thing I would highlight is that to access the main compartment, opening it suitcase style is from the back zipper closest to your back when being worn, which makes it pretty safe from any accidental opening. However the top of the main compartment can still be accessed from the front via a zipper that goes across the width of the bag only.",

After my recent experience with the Thule Aion 28 I’m curious to learn the differences between the Aion and Subterras. \n\nI’m very curious about your experience with the 40L and any other 40L bags. I’ve been trying to get my wife to go with a one bag backpack but she has a hard time slimming down her desired load. Do you think you could fit in a jacket and another toiletries bag (yes she has three)?  How does the 40L carry ie does it feel heavy, does it distribute the weight well?  I know you had no issues with the Subterra but do you have any other 40s to compare it against in terms of being able to fit everything in?  Sorry for all the questions!  I appreciate your POV here as my wife ignores mine LOL!",

        "selftext": "I just got back from a quick couple of rainy days in Amsterdam, figured I'd share my feedback on the new Thule Landmark series of bags and how the 70 liter in particular worked out for me last weekend.\n\nThe Landmark bags are available in a:\n\n40 liter (one 40L duffel bag with a built-in laptop compartment)\n\n60 liter (dual bag system = one 40L duffel bag with no laptop compartment that clips into a 20L daypack)\n\n70 liter (dual bag system = one 50L duffel bag with no laptop compartment that clips into a 20L daypack)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[70 Liter Landmark = 20L Daypack + 50L Main Duffel](https://preview.redd.it/lnr9jkipg7n21.png?width=3386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d30f7b16d873a10f1081b9693773aadd3d68f95)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did some video to go along with this writeup:\n\n[https://youtu.be/4X2KASvbZf8](https://youtu.be/4X2KASvbZf8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw these bags last year at the Outdoor Retailer trade show, but at the time I didn't pay too much attention. I was *relatively* happy with my Osprey Ozone 46, Porter 46, Arc'teryx Khard and Blade, and another bag I was using at the time, but kinda wanted them to have a baby and mix some features of each.\n\nBy the time the Consumer Electronics Show rolled around, and I sniffed the Landmarks again at their CES booth. I was impressed enough that figured I should buy one and give it a jaunt to see how it did. I got it from eBags, used a coupon, and got what I felt was a pretty fair deal on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst points: I only travel with a carry on if I can help it, so going with the Landmark 70L was a bit of a risk: It's specs show it as *over* carry on size on most airlines. However, as you'll see in my video, I stuck it in four different airlines bag-limit sizers, and it fit. Admittedly, it was 3/4 full, so I could squish it down. I suppose I could have overstuffed a 60L, or understuffed a 70L with similar results.\n\n[Not a carry on size? We'll see about that!](https://preview.redd.it/7skz8e0zh7n21.png?width=2980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aab6f7c53a79143f1e4e7959c229857770ee33d)\n\nThe 20L daypack also easily fits into the \"personal item\" sizer:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llokz5kcg7n21.png?width=3818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797781d2c9aa3809d33ea58410d5bfd1862b9a40\n\nOn that note, the 70 (which is a 50L main bag + a 20L daypack system) is a little lumpy and sloshy when it's not full. You can tell this is one of those bags where, for sales photos, they're going to have it stuffed to the max with pillows to give it a nice clean shape... but when you get it home, it's floppy and unkempt.\n\nIt's not BAD, but it does have some extra lumpiness if it's not crammed full. I also wish it had some very thin foam like the Porter or Peak Travel bags to give it structure and hold it open when you pack it. I hate how bags collapse when you're packing them. I mean, it's not anywhere near as bad as the Patagonia MLC, which is a soft blob of a bag where all your stuff slides down to the bottom and shifts around as you walk, hurting your back. Conversely, form and rigidity is not as good as a Porter 46 with its foam compression wings, but then again, it's got more useful space than the Porter. The Porter wastes too much space and weight with laptop foam and too much side foam. I don't travel with a laptop often, and when I do, I just sandwich it between some fleece or pants and it's never been a problem.\n\nBecause of this unkemptness/floppiness, I was initially disappointed with it, but after loading it up and carrying it around, I really liked the way it sat on my back - great support, straps and hipbelt worked better than anything else in my quiver. I'm 6'2\" and hip belts either squish my gut (yeah, yeah) or sit way too high just below my ribs. This fit like I suspect hip belts have always supposed to fit me but never did.   :)\n\nHip belts! Arg. Con area: The 40L and the 60L fold up and tuck inside the rear panel. But the 70L... it's got that flap that goes over the whole straps/belts, so someone decided the belt tucking away was redundant. BUT IT'S NOT. There's times I prefer not to wear the hip belt. There's times I carry the bag by the side handle and don't want the hip belt flapping around. So your choices are apparently \"wear the belt\" or \"have it dangle\".\n\nPro area: The top Safe Zone turtle-top hardshell compartment is a nice touch. I'd stick sunglasses and a phone in there, small camera, etc. and not worry about it getting squished. At first, it seemed like not enough organization, but I like just a few pockets that are useful rather than a sea of little gimmick pockets that lose your stuff or it all falls out when the bag is tipped. Thule did this well, with a good compromise of minimal and useful.\n\nSame with the little passport-cash safe pockets on the large and daypack bags. Nice feature, clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, this series is so-close to really good, but is also a bunch of catch-22's for me: I think if I was to do it again, I'd get the 60L, because it's got the tuck-away hip belt and is a little trimmer. Oh - but the Men's 40L and 60L doesn't have the load lifters. But the women's 40L and 60L *do*?  WHY? Arg. Why can't the Landmark series all have load lifters? Why does one's hipbelt tuck away, but not on all of them? Why does the 70L have sewn in straps, whereas the others are buckled in? Maybe these aren't big deals, but they're annoying choices I don't want to make. We're all in this looking for the perfect bag with all the features, not trying to make tradeoffs!  :)\n\nI think I'll keep this bag, it's too nice to get rid of, especially at the price, but I'm interested in comparing it to the much pricier Peak travel bag. I have grown annoyed at the Porter 46 for having too much padding and features I don't use (too much organization and wasted space/weight on laptop compartment), so I am drawn towards the Landmark 60 and 70 not requiring you to have the laptop compartment.\n\n[Those load lifters on the 70L!](https://preview.redd.it/oz6cv3nhg7n21.png?width=3262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee8f028593f04ec939e917606207f1b3eb35c30f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: It's a good bag. Fantastic support, belt and straps. It fits me very well. Happy-medium weight. Looks well constructed and durable. Stylish if it's chock full, lumpy and shifty if not. Hardshell top is a nice feature. Good compromise between organization and lots of open space. Good price for what you're getting.\n\nAsk questions, check the video, I'll answer to best ability!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
