        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ine9n8/rofmia_backpack_v2_detailed_initial_impressions/",
        "selftext": "#Intro\n\nI recently purchased the rofmia Backpack v2 new and it arrived last week.  Because of COVID-19, I haven't been able to put it to good use traveling or wearing about, but wanted to provide some impressions now because info on the backpack is a bit scarce.  \n\nTo start let me be blunt:  this bag is expensive (~$800 with shipping), but to me it's worth the price - *it's one of the most premium feeling, well-designed bag I've handled*.  I'll try to be thorough in my impressions, but it's very hard for me to find any cons with the bag.  \n\n##[&gt;&gt; PICS &lt;&lt;](https://imgur.com/a/BX08otr)\n\n_(Pics also linked inline below in context.)_\n\n#Impressions\n\n#####Top Quick Access Pocket\n\n* Quick access pocket at top is a game changer.  It's small, but [perfectly fits my wallet attached by key strap](https://i.imgur.com/yafdR0u.jpg) (it has [a small hidden keyring](https://i.imgur.com/ZYV52Fh.jpg) that I can attach the strap to).\n\n* Quick access pocket is made of stretch fabric so it's accommodating in size.  [It does stretch/take a little space away from the main compartment of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/vM0B06l.jpg), but that isn't a big deal because top space isn't well used anyways. \n\n* The zipper is a folding zipper, and [there's a small webbing garage](https://i.imgur.com/OFkLeNV.jpg) so it's out of the way when closed. \n\n#####Laptop Side Pocket\n\n* Runs along back side of the bag and zips/unzips smoothly.  \n  - Much easier to use [than the one on my custom rofmia backpack v1](https://i.imgur.com/9F2t2N2.jpg), where the zipper would get caught on the compression snaps and be annoying to zip/unzip.  \n  - note [rolltop closure bottom button on v2 is attached via webbing loop now and stands stiffly away from the laptop zipper](https://i.imgur.com/mftO1DP.jpg), so it never gets in the way.\n\n* There's padding on both front/back of the laptop pocket, and it's suspended about 1cm off the ground.  Wish it was suspended a little bit more, but it's honestly fine.\n\n* [Easily fits my 13\" retina macbook pro with room to spare](https://i.imgur.com/MywGM9r.jpg).  I could see this fitting a 16\" macbook pro, or even thicker gaming laptops (though taller laptops [may interfere with the top quick access pocket when full](https://i.imgur.com/vM0B06l.jpg)).  The opening is [very generous and the laptop is very easy to slip in and out](https://i.imgur.com/37sX1eN.jpg).\n\n* [The zipper tucks neatly under a triangle-shaped garage at the top when zipped shut](https://i.imgur.com/CFTVajf.jpg). The zipper doesn't interfere with carry comfort at all.\n\n#####Water Bottle Pockets\n\n* The stretch fabric is dense and actually has some structure, and the top 1.5\" or so is reinforced with an additional layer of stretch fabric to keep it stable.  \n\n* The pockets seem deep and flexible enough to accommodate many different bottle sizes.  \n  - They fit [my rivers water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/dVOUXeQ.jpg), a [generic 18L stainless steel water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/UKDtcOL.jpg), and even [my 18L blender bottle](https://i.imgur.com/VYdTpPY.jpg) just fine.  \n  - Unfortunately I don't have bigger water bottles to test with, but I think it could fit a nalgene 1L water bottle okay - the 2.9oz dyneema on the sides is flexible and allows larger water bottles to expand inwards towards the bag as needed.\n  - EDIT:  [here’s a pic with two 1L water bottles](https://imgur.com/a/5rBlANX).\n\n* When not in use they're pretty inoffensive looking and lie pretty flat.  Again, water bottles seem to mould into the bag a little than jut outwards, helping keeping the bottle centered closer in the bag, and [keeping the bag more streamlined even with a larger water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/VYdTpPY.jpg).\n\n* Because the rolltop fidlock kinda juts outwards, it [helps trap the water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/N8xIEF7.jpg), so it's harder for it to fall out.\n\n#####Front Access Panel\n\n* It's amazing how much more sturdy the stretch fabric pocketing feels over the more crinkly nylon ripstop pocketing of the v1.\n\n* [Bottom pocket opening has been oriented diagonally](https://i.imgur.com/QfdVb3v.jpg) so it's easier to access when backpack is swung over the right shoulder.  \n  - There's a small pen loop which is really just a webbing loop.  \n  - The pocket opening makes it difficult to fit larger items (e.g. a notebook) in there because of the smaller opening, but smaller things like a portable charger + cables fits in easily and securely.  \n  - Pocket runs the width of the bag so it's sizable.\n\n* Internal zippered pocket has one of those \"lay-flat\" ykk zippers which is nice (no jiggle).  It's generously sized (runs width of the bag), and [seems like a great place to fit my passport and wallet or other small accessories](https://i.imgur.com/J9NFJxH.jpg).  \n\n* It's hard to see, but there's also a small webbing loop at the top.  I've found [it's the perfect place for me to put my outlier key piece](https://i.imgur.com/y9BQEE4.jpg) - that way, my keys are attached, but I can easily detach/reattach with minimal fiddling.\n\n* Like v1, [there's a zipper along the side that opens to get full access to the main compartment of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/sPYHFrk.jpg).  I think this is smart, as it allows [easy access to all contents of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/CbMfnuu.jpg) (even contents at the bottom) when swung off the right shoulder, while also protecting the contents from the elements [because it's protected behind two zippers and an outer flap covering](https://i.imgur.com/XjOtEOg.jpg).  \n\n* Small detail, pbut the front access pocket is actually gusseted so it can expand to fit more items](https://i.imgur.com/vfJKMfN.jpg).  I can see myself [putting the Tom Bihn medium cafe bag freudian slip there](https://i.imgur.com/Qfbj68N.jpg) for additional organization (it fits perfectly), or other accessorieslike a hat on top of the front panel organization.\n\n#####Top Rolltop Access\n\n* Revised fidlock system works very well in practice.  \n  - It doesn't allow half-turns like the old buckle system; however, I always rolled it down in full turns anyways, and [the easy detatch and magnetically guided attach makes the tradeoff worthwhile for me](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d088a3_171e7538bf394f91b64b65aeb2a4ee4e~mv2.gif).\n  - With buckles, re-attaching is a two-handed practice requiring attention:  you have to find the buckle, then attach it.  But with the fidlocks, it's one-handed:  the attachment point is stiff so all you have to do is get close and the magnets guide it securely into place - so much easier.\n  - The lack of dangling and distracting compression straps [makes attaching the rolltop fidlocks simpler and more straightforward](https://i.imgur.com/mftO1DP.jpg).  \n\n* [Internal compression system removes any dangling compression straps](https://i.imgur.com/X7hXCh3.jpg).  \n  - Despite looking easy to adjust/loosen (it's just held in place by thin nylon webbing), it takes some work as the buckle's slots hold the straps securely in place; you have to pull the webbing through the buckle slot manually to get it to adjust.  \n  - As I don't expect to adjust the rolltop compression frequently, I like that it isn't easy to adjust, as I'd prefer to have it not loosen unexpectedly when I'm walking about.\n\n* The fidlocks [snap to two buttons on the top of the rolltop when fully undone](https://i.imgur.com/RBSjJAS.jpg).  This was actually a lot nicer than I thought - just very nice and satisfying to have the large buckles out of the way/not dangling/rattling when trying to get something in/out of the main compartment.\n\n#####Main Compartment\n\n* Massive bucket:  [can easily fit a tom bihn tristar medium packing cube](https://i.imgur.com/PhYz5tB.jpg) (I think a large aeronaut 45 packing cube would fit in here too), with room on the top to spare for items like a toiletries kit, jacket, etc.  Because the DCF is whitish on the inside, things are actually pretty visible. \n\n* When rolltop is closed, everything still accessible via side zip (as already mentioned).\n\n* Side stretch fabric water bottle pockets [actually provide some structure to the sides so doesn't collapse inwards](https://i.imgur.com/PRIJN4V.jpg) when accessing the main compartment.\n\n* Laptop pocket is separated from main compartment by a 3/8\" eva foam padding (though [it is open at the top so it can be inserted top-access](https://i.imgur.com/PRIJN4V.jpg), but why would you do that)\n\n#####Shoulder Straps\n\n* [Very plush and pliable](https://i.imgur.com/H92kQBK.jpg), with [comfortable curved shape and edgeless design](https://i.imgur.com/OOunMxf.jpg).  \n  - Kinda like the tom bihn edgeless straps in that they both conform to the body, but with the backpack v2's 3/8\" padding being less plush than the tom bihn's 1/2\" straps (the tradeoff here is the rofmia straps have a lower profile and lighter weight because of the thinner padding).  \n  - They're a good length and width too.\n\n* The straps are a lot more comfortable than the daypack v2 when new.  \n  - I think it's because the 2.9oz on the backpack v2 straps is more pliable/flexible than the daypack v2's when new, so it better conforms to the body than the daypack's, which feel more rigid in comparison.\n\n* [Fidlock on sternum strap is makes attaching/reattaching trivially esay.](https://i.imgur.com/6SY91E7.jpg)\n  - I usually hate wearing sternum straps (even though it helps stabilize the bag with heavier loads) because attaching the buckles usually requires fiddling with both hands to find both sides and snapping them together -- just a tedious process to do quickly.\n  - With the fidlock it becomes a one handed operation:  [as one side stays in place (it's short)](https://i.imgur.com/xxvIQmD.jpg), it's easy to magnetically guide the other side to the buckle with one hand.  I find myself using the sternum straps more when I use ones with fidlocks.\n\n* Load-lifting straps do work well; [they help bring the top of the bag closer to the body, which helps keep the bag from tipping backwards and straining your shoulders](https://i.imgur.com/OKcXfj4.jpg).  Hidden benefit is that it increases the top strap width distance, which makes it more comfortable if you have a larger neck/wider frame.  \n  - Strap keepers make adjusting the load-lifters more difficult (more friction), but it's not that bad:  pull on the strap to tighten, lift up on the nifco plastic adjuster to loosen.  Can be done with one hand, but works better with two hands.\n\n* [Strap keepers](https://i.imgur.com/Og7yfY3.jpg) for the bottom straps helps keep dangling straps out of the way.  Not having dangling straps fluttering when you're bike riding or just generally walking around is nice.\n\n* Back panel is padded with a semi-rigid 1/2\" piece of EVA foam.  Although technically a \"hard flat plate against your back\", it works for me because it just rests comfortably above my waist (I'm 5'8\").\n\n#####Design Details and Construction\n\n* Zippers:\n  - Zippers are aquaguard, but [have a nice almost leathery texture to them](https://i.imgur.com/9vDAEsS.jpg) that feel more premium than most other ykk aquaguard zippers, which feel plasticky in comparison.\n  - Zippers for laptop compartment, front access, and main bag side internal access have [pulls that are small and slightly chiselled](https://i.imgur.com/pFyowzW.jpg), look premium, and are pretty quiet (don't jangle).\n  - Zippers for top quick access, front internal pocket, and rolltop top are [\"lay-flat\" kind that don't jiggle around and lay flat and low-profile](https://i.imgur.com/OFkLeNV.jpg).\n\n* Construction is immaculate.  \n  - Stitching is even, stitched multiple times for added durability at high-use areas.\n  - [All seams are finished](https://i.imgur.com/XjOtEOg.jpg) (although not taped, but that shouldn't be too big a problem since it's a rolltop)\n  - Stiffer/slightly more structured 5.0oz DCF is used on bottom, front, and back for durability\n  - More flexible 2.9oz DCF is used on rolltop, sides, and straps where added flexibility is desirable (sides benefit for compression and accommodating varying water bottle sizes)\n  - [Webbing used has a softer texture and matte look](https://i.imgur.com/TZMrTWP.jpg) than most other slippery nylon webbings on other bags\n\n##### Design Discussion and Size Comparison\n\n* The bag seems to have been meticulously designed to eliminate excess and distraction, which helps make using the bag feel more zen, focused, and easy to use..\n  - Zipper pulls are small to avoid excessive clanking/noise\n  - Compression straps have been eliminated [in favor of stretch interior compression, with no straps](https://i.imgur.com/IiL37bv.jpg).\n  - Rolltop compression straps [has been redesigned so all the \"adjustment\" is internal, with strap management to prevent dangling straps](https://i.imgur.com/X7hXCh3.jpg).\n  - All other straps have strap keepers to keep them out of the way.  \n  - All the zippers are smooth, fidlocks make attaching the rolltop closure/sternum strap easy one-handed gestures.  \n\n* [The tri-tone of subtly lighter-colored 5.0oz DCF, darker 2.9oz DCF, and matte black stretch fabric creates a sophisticated modern aesthetic](https://i.imgur.com/Ut9Trlz.jpg).  And without the compression straps it looks a lot cleaner than the backpack v1.\n\n* DCF rolltop design is excellent for rain protection since there's no top zipper for rain to seep through, yet contents are still easily accessible through the front side pocket.  Addition of laptop back access pocket is great convenience improvement over v1 - now you really can just keep the rolltop always closed, and access the laptop/other EDC items easily through the other access pockets.\n\n##### Size and Weight Comparisons\n\n* Size seems perfect for one-bag travel.  I think it's just small enough that it can maybe get away as a personal item, which was one of the big draws of the bag for me.  Compared to the 40L v1 I had before, it's just so slightly smaller and feels just right.  I don't think I would've used the 40L as a daypack, but I can definitely see this 35L (25L when rolltop is compressed) doing well as a daypack.  \n  - [Compared with Tom Bihn Aeronaut 30](https://i.imgur.com/XErj2w1.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Aer Travel Pack 2 X-Pac](https://i.imgur.com/d2QYtIT.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Tom Bihn Synapse 19](https://i.imgur.com/7AJmnrS.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Daypack v1](https://i.imgur.com/mt7X3ij.jpg) (sold rofmia daypack v2 and custom backpack v1, so no size comparison unfortunately)\n  - [Flattened (nothing inside)](https://i.imgur.com/M3HMrWc.jpg)\n  - [Moderately packed (rolltop not extended full)](https://i.imgur.com/OKcXfj4.jpg)\n\n* Much much lighter weight than other travel bags:  \n  - backpack v2 is 1.75lbs \n  - vs Aeronaut 30 (2.38lbs in halcyon)\n  - vs Aer Travel Pack 2 X-Pac (3.4lbs in x-pac)\n  - vs synik 22L (2.49lbs in halcyon)\n  - vs synik 30L (2.85lbs in halcyon)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nRofmia mentioned that over 15 prototype Backpacks were made before the final v2 form was created; that should speak to how thoroughly designed and well thought-out this v2 version is.  Effort was put into removing any distraction (excess straps, noisy zippers) and designing what's left to be simple and easy to use (fidlocks, smooth zippers).  \n\nEvery aspect of the design feels deliberate and premium, and it really is a joy to handle and use.  It's an expensive bag at $800, but I feel it's well worth it in craftmanship and design.  I hope I could communicate some of the great details of this bag in the bullets above.  \n\n**_Overall:_**  *I'm very glad I bought mine and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium bag that can be used for both EDC and travel.  10/10.*\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading.  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to answer them.  I hope to write more follow-up impressions once I get to travel with it.\n\nCheers!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(EDIT:  realized I didn't put the product link, here it is:  https://en.rofmia.com/product-page/backpack-v2)\n\n^(EDIT:  added some photos with [two 32oz water bottles fitting in the side pockets](https://imgur.com/a/5rBlANX).)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n^(p.s. These impressions took me many hours over several days to take all the pictures and write up.  If you liked this, please consider upvoting!  )",

I have Rofmia's Boston bag, and I haven't been able to find a lot of info, but it is very similar or the same material used in [this day pack](https://ghostly.com/products/ghostly-x-rpmfg-dyneema-backpack) (that I also own) which describes the material as \"2.92oz Hybrid Dyneema Composite Fabric\".  AFAIK that pack uses [this material](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/2-92-oz-dyneema-composite-fabric-hybrid-ct5k-18-wov-32c?variant=1007084765210).  I would believe it if Rofmia was using the same stuff.  So, the DCF in Rofmia's bags is more providing a lightweight waterproof backing, and the outer woven fabric adds abrasian resistance (and I think looks/feels quite nice).\n\nI'm interested to see if any cottage manufacturers try to make bags out of the \"Dyneema Black\" stuff that Vollebak used in [this thing](https://www.vollebak.com/product/indestructible-puffer/).  It's absolutely not ultralight, but it would be very strong.  I know woven Dyneema is used for ropes where strength is paramount.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ine9n8/rofmia_backpack_v2_detailed_initial_impressions/?tl=fr",
        "selftext": "#Intro\n\nI recently purchased the rofmia Backpack v2 new and it arrived last week.  Because of COVID-19, I haven't been able to put it to good use traveling or wearing about, but wanted to provide some impressions now because info on the backpack is a bit scarce.  \n\nTo start let me be blunt:  this bag is expensive (~$800 with shipping), but to me it's worth the price - *it's one of the most premium feeling, well-designed bag I've handled*.  I'll try to be thorough in my impressions, but it's very hard for me to find any cons with the bag.  \n\n##[&gt;&gt; PICS &lt;&lt;](https://imgur.com/a/BX08otr)\n\n_(Pics also linked inline below in context.)_\n\n#Impressions\n\n#####Top Quick Access Pocket\n\n* Quick access pocket at top is a game changer.  It's small, but [perfectly fits my wallet attached by key strap](https://i.imgur.com/yafdR0u.jpg) (it has [a small hidden keyring](https://i.imgur.com/ZYV52Fh.jpg) that I can attach the strap to).\n\n* Quick access pocket is made of stretch fabric so it's accommodating in size.  [It does stretch/take a little space away from the main compartment of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/vM0B06l.jpg), but that isn't a big deal because top space isn't well used anyways. \n\n* The zipper is a folding zipper, and [there's a small webbing garage](https://i.imgur.com/OFkLeNV.jpg) so it's out of the way when closed. \n\n#####Laptop Side Pocket\n\n* Runs along back side of the bag and zips/unzips smoothly.  \n  - Much easier to use [than the one on my custom rofmia backpack v1](https://i.imgur.com/9F2t2N2.jpg), where the zipper would get caught on the compression snaps and be annoying to zip/unzip.  \n  - note [rolltop closure bottom button on v2 is attached via webbing loop now and stands stiffly away from the laptop zipper](https://i.imgur.com/mftO1DP.jpg), so it never gets in the way.\n\n* There's padding on both front/back of the laptop pocket, and it's suspended about 1cm off the ground.  Wish it was suspended a little bit more, but it's honestly fine.\n\n* [Easily fits my 13\" retina macbook pro with room to spare](https://i.imgur.com/MywGM9r.jpg).  I could see this fitting a 16\" macbook pro, or even thicker gaming laptops (though taller laptops [may interfere with the top quick access pocket when full](https://i.imgur.com/vM0B06l.jpg)).  The opening is [very generous and the laptop is very easy to slip in and out](https://i.imgur.com/37sX1eN.jpg).\n\n* [The zipper tucks neatly under a triangle-shaped garage at the top when zipped shut](https://i.imgur.com/CFTVajf.jpg). The zipper doesn't interfere with carry comfort at all.\n\n#####Water Bottle Pockets\n\n* The stretch fabric is dense and actually has some structure, and the top 1.5\" or so is reinforced with an additional layer of stretch fabric to keep it stable.  \n\n* The pockets seem deep and flexible enough to accommodate many different bottle sizes.  \n  - They fit [my rivers water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/dVOUXeQ.jpg), a [generic 18L stainless steel water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/UKDtcOL.jpg), and even [my 18L blender bottle](https://i.imgur.com/VYdTpPY.jpg) just fine.  \n  - Unfortunately I don't have bigger water bottles to test with, but I think it could fit a nalgene 1L water bottle okay - the 2.9oz dyneema on the sides is flexible and allows larger water bottles to expand inwards towards the bag as needed.\n  - EDIT:  [here’s a pic with two 1L water bottles](https://imgur.com/a/5rBlANX).\n\n* When not in use they're pretty inoffensive looking and lie pretty flat.  Again, water bottles seem to mould into the bag a little than jut outwards, helping keeping the bottle centered closer in the bag, and [keeping the bag more streamlined even with a larger water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/VYdTpPY.jpg).\n\n* Because the rolltop fidlock kinda juts outwards, it [helps trap the water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/N8xIEF7.jpg), so it's harder for it to fall out.\n\n#####Front Access Panel\n\n* It's amazing how much more sturdy the stretch fabric pocketing feels over the more crinkly nylon ripstop pocketing of the v1.\n\n* [Bottom pocket opening has been oriented diagonally](https://i.imgur.com/QfdVb3v.jpg) so it's easier to access when backpack is swung over the right shoulder.  \n  - There's a small pen loop which is really just a webbing loop.  \n  - The pocket opening makes it difficult to fit larger items (e.g. a notebook) in there because of the smaller opening, but smaller things like a portable charger + cables fits in easily and securely.  \n  - Pocket runs the width of the bag so it's sizable.\n\n* Internal zippered pocket has one of those \"lay-flat\" ykk zippers which is nice (no jiggle).  It's generously sized (runs width of the bag), and [seems like a great place to fit my passport and wallet or other small accessories](https://i.imgur.com/J9NFJxH.jpg).  \n\n* It's hard to see, but there's also a small webbing loop at the top.  I've found [it's the perfect place for me to put my outlier key piece](https://i.imgur.com/y9BQEE4.jpg) - that way, my keys are attached, but I can easily detach/reattach with minimal fiddling.\n\n* Like v1, [there's a zipper along the side that opens to get full access to the main compartment of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/sPYHFrk.jpg).  I think this is smart, as it allows [easy access to all contents of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/CbMfnuu.jpg) (even contents at the bottom) when swung off the right shoulder, while also protecting the contents from the elements [because it's protected behind two zippers and an outer flap covering](https://i.imgur.com/XjOtEOg.jpg).  \n\n* Small detail, pbut the front access pocket is actually gusseted so it can expand to fit more items](https://i.imgur.com/vfJKMfN.jpg).  I can see myself [putting the Tom Bihn medium cafe bag freudian slip there](https://i.imgur.com/Qfbj68N.jpg) for additional organization (it fits perfectly), or other accessorieslike a hat on top of the front panel organization.\n\n#####Top Rolltop Access\n\n* Revised fidlock system works very well in practice.  \n  - It doesn't allow half-turns like the old buckle system; however, I always rolled it down in full turns anyways, and [the easy detatch and magnetically guided attach makes the tradeoff worthwhile for me](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d088a3_171e7538bf394f91b64b65aeb2a4ee4e~mv2.gif).\n  - With buckles, re-attaching is a two-handed practice requiring attention:  you have to find the buckle, then attach it.  But with the fidlocks, it's one-handed:  the attachment point is stiff so all you have to do is get close and the magnets guide it securely into place - so much easier.\n  - The lack of dangling and distracting compression straps [makes attaching the rolltop fidlocks simpler and more straightforward](https://i.imgur.com/mftO1DP.jpg).  \n\n* [Internal compression system removes any dangling compression straps](https://i.imgur.com/X7hXCh3.jpg).  \n  - Despite looking easy to adjust/loosen (it's just held in place by thin nylon webbing), it takes some work as the buckle's slots hold the straps securely in place; you have to pull the webbing through the buckle slot manually to get it to adjust.  \n  - As I don't expect to adjust the rolltop compression frequently, I like that it isn't easy to adjust, as I'd prefer to have it not loosen unexpectedly when I'm walking about.\n\n* The fidlocks [snap to two buttons on the top of the rolltop when fully undone](https://i.imgur.com/RBSjJAS.jpg).  This was actually a lot nicer than I thought - just very nice and satisfying to have the large buckles out of the way/not dangling/rattling when trying to get something in/out of the main compartment.\n\n#####Main Compartment\n\n* Massive bucket:  [can easily fit a tom bihn tristar medium packing cube](https://i.imgur.com/PhYz5tB.jpg) (I think a large aeronaut 45 packing cube would fit in here too), with room on the top to spare for items like a toiletries kit, jacket, etc.  Because the DCF is whitish on the inside, things are actually pretty visible. \n\n* When rolltop is closed, everything still accessible via side zip (as already mentioned).\n\n* Side stretch fabric water bottle pockets [actually provide some structure to the sides so doesn't collapse inwards](https://i.imgur.com/PRIJN4V.jpg) when accessing the main compartment.\n\n* Laptop pocket is separated from main compartment by a 3/8\" eva foam padding (though [it is open at the top so it can be inserted top-access](https://i.imgur.com/PRIJN4V.jpg), but why would you do that)\n\n#####Shoulder Straps\n\n* [Very plush and pliable](https://i.imgur.com/H92kQBK.jpg), with [comfortable curved shape and edgeless design](https://i.imgur.com/OOunMxf.jpg).  \n  - Kinda like the tom bihn edgeless straps in that they both conform to the body, but with the backpack v2's 3/8\" padding being less plush than the tom bihn's 1/2\" straps (the tradeoff here is the rofmia straps have a lower profile and lighter weight because of the thinner padding).  \n  - They're a good length and width too.\n\n* The straps are a lot more comfortable than the daypack v2 when new.  \n  - I think it's because the 2.9oz on the backpack v2 straps is more pliable/flexible than the daypack v2's when new, so it better conforms to the body than the daypack's, which feel more rigid in comparison.\n\n* [Fidlock on sternum strap is makes attaching/reattaching trivially esay.](https://i.imgur.com/6SY91E7.jpg)\n  - I usually hate wearing sternum straps (even though it helps stabilize the bag with heavier loads) because attaching the buckles usually requires fiddling with both hands to find both sides and snapping them together -- just a tedious process to do quickly.\n  - With the fidlock it becomes a one handed operation:  [as one side stays in place (it's short)](https://i.imgur.com/xxvIQmD.jpg), it's easy to magnetically guide the other side to the buckle with one hand.  I find myself using the sternum straps more when I use ones with fidlocks.\n\n* Load-lifting straps do work well; [they help bring the top of the bag closer to the body, which helps keep the bag from tipping backwards and straining your shoulders](https://i.imgur.com/OKcXfj4.jpg).  Hidden benefit is that it increases the top strap width distance, which makes it more comfortable if you have a larger neck/wider frame.  \n  - Strap keepers make adjusting the load-lifters more difficult (more friction), but it's not that bad:  pull on the strap to tighten, lift up on the nifco plastic adjuster to loosen.  Can be done with one hand, but works better with two hands.\n\n* [Strap keepers](https://i.imgur.com/Og7yfY3.jpg) for the bottom straps helps keep dangling straps out of the way.  Not having dangling straps fluttering when you're bike riding or just generally walking around is nice.\n\n* Back panel is padded with a semi-rigid 1/2\" piece of EVA foam.  Although technically a \"hard flat plate against your back\", it works for me because it just rests comfortably above my waist (I'm 5'8\").\n\n#####Design Details and Construction\n\n* Zippers:\n  - Zippers are aquaguard, but [have a nice almost leathery texture to them](https://i.imgur.com/9vDAEsS.jpg) that feel more premium than most other ykk aquaguard zippers, which feel plasticky in comparison.\n  - Zippers for laptop compartment, front access, and main bag side internal access have [pulls that are small and slightly chiselled](https://i.imgur.com/pFyowzW.jpg), look premium, and are pretty quiet (don't jangle).\n  - Zippers for top quick access, front internal pocket, and rolltop top are [\"lay-flat\" kind that don't jiggle around and lay flat and low-profile](https://i.imgur.com/OFkLeNV.jpg).\n\n* Construction is immaculate.  \n  - Stitching is even, stitched multiple times for added durability at high-use areas.\n  - [All seams are finished](https://i.imgur.com/XjOtEOg.jpg) (although not taped, but that shouldn't be too big a problem since it's a rolltop)\n  - Stiffer/slightly more structured 5.0oz DCF is used on bottom, front, and back for durability\n  - More flexible 2.9oz DCF is used on rolltop, sides, and straps where added flexibility is desirable (sides benefit for compression and accommodating varying water bottle sizes)\n  - [Webbing used has a softer texture and matte look](https://i.imgur.com/TZMrTWP.jpg) than most other slippery nylon webbings on other bags\n\n##### Design Discussion and Size Comparison\n\n* The bag seems to have been meticulously designed to eliminate excess and distraction, which helps make using the bag feel more zen, focused, and easy to use..\n  - Zipper pulls are small to avoid excessive clanking/noise\n  - Compression straps have been eliminated [in favor of stretch interior compression, with no straps](https://i.imgur.com/IiL37bv.jpg).\n  - Rolltop compression straps [has been redesigned so all the \"adjustment\" is internal, with strap management to prevent dangling straps](https://i.imgur.com/X7hXCh3.jpg).\n  - All other straps have strap keepers to keep them out of the way.  \n  - All the zippers are smooth, fidlocks make attaching the rolltop closure/sternum strap easy one-handed gestures.  \n\n* [The tri-tone of subtly lighter-colored 5.0oz DCF, darker 2.9oz DCF, and matte black stretch fabric creates a sophisticated modern aesthetic](https://i.imgur.com/Ut9Trlz.jpg).  And without the compression straps it looks a lot cleaner than the backpack v1.\n\n* DCF rolltop design is excellent for rain protection since there's no top zipper for rain to seep through, yet contents are still easily accessible through the front side pocket.  Addition of laptop back access pocket is great convenience improvement over v1 - now you really can just keep the rolltop always closed, and access the laptop/other EDC items easily through the other access pockets.\n\n##### Size and Weight Comparisons\n\n* Size seems perfect for one-bag travel.  I think it's just small enough that it can maybe get away as a personal item, which was one of the big draws of the bag for me.  Compared to the 40L v1 I had before, it's just so slightly smaller and feels just right.  I don't think I would've used the 40L as a daypack, but I can definitely see this 35L (25L when rolltop is compressed) doing well as a daypack.  \n  - [Compared with Tom Bihn Aeronaut 30](https://i.imgur.com/XErj2w1.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Aer Travel Pack 2 X-Pac](https://i.imgur.com/d2QYtIT.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Tom Bihn Synapse 19](https://i.imgur.com/7AJmnrS.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Daypack v1](https://i.imgur.com/mt7X3ij.jpg) (sold rofmia daypack v2 and custom backpack v1, so no size comparison unfortunately)\n  - [Flattened (nothing inside)](https://i.imgur.com/M3HMrWc.jpg)\n  - [Moderately packed (rolltop not extended full)](https://i.imgur.com/OKcXfj4.jpg)\n\n* Much much lighter weight than other travel bags:  \n  - backpack v2 is 1.75lbs \n  - vs Aeronaut 30 (2.38lbs in halcyon)\n  - vs Aer Travel Pack 2 X-Pac (3.4lbs in x-pac)\n  - vs synik 22L (2.49lbs in halcyon)\n  - vs synik 30L (2.85lbs in halcyon)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nRofmia mentioned that over 15 prototype Backpacks were made before the final v2 form was created; that should speak to how thoroughly designed and well thought-out this v2 version is.  Effort was put into removing any distraction (excess straps, noisy zippers) and designing what's left to be simple and easy to use (fidlocks, smooth zippers).  \n\nEvery aspect of the design feels deliberate and premium, and it really is a joy to handle and use.  It's an expensive bag at $800, but I feel it's well worth it in craftmanship and design.  I hope I could communicate some of the great details of this bag in the bullets above.  \n\n**_Overall:_**  *I'm very glad I bought mine and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium bag that can be used for both EDC and travel.  10/10.*\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading.  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to answer them.  I hope to write more follow-up impressions once I get to travel with it.\n\nCheers!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(EDIT:  realized I didn't put the product link, here it is:  https://en.rofmia.com/product-page/backpack-v2)\n\n^(EDIT:  added some photos with [two 32oz water bottles fitting in the side pockets](https://imgur.com/a/5rBlANX).)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n^(p.s. These impressions took me many hours over several days to take all the pictures and write up.  If you liked this, please consider upvoting!  )",

                "body": "AFAIK, the use of DCF in Rofmia's daypack and Boston bags is an inner laminate, but the outer material is a woven polyester (i.e., it is not just a single layer or dual layer Dyneema laminate as used by HMG or Zpacks).  I have Rofmia's Boston bag, and I haven't been able to find a lot of info, but it is very similar or the same material used in [this day pack](https://ghostly.com/products/ghostly-x-rpmfg-dyneema-backpack) (that I also own) which describes the material as \"2.92oz Hybrid Dyneema Composite Fabric\".  AFAIK that pack uses [this material](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/2-92-oz-dyneema-composite-fabric-hybrid-ct5k-18-wov-32c?variant=1007084765210).  I would believe it if Rofmia was using the same stuff.  So, the DCF in Rofmia's bags is more providing a lightweight waterproof backing, and the outer woven fabric adds abrasian resistance (and I think looks/feels quite nice).\n\nI'm interested to see if any cottage manufacturers try to make bags out of the \"Dyneema Black\" stuff that Vollebak used in [this thing](https://www.vollebak.com/product/indestructible-puffer/).  It's absolutely not ultralight, but it would be very strong.  I know woven Dyneema is used for ropes where strength is paramount.",
