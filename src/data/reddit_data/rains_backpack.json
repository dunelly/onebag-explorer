I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

            "body": "Just picked up a used Rains Mountaineer backpack   ([https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag](https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag)) in very good condition, and wanted to post some pics and thoughts on the bag since I couldn't find much more info online. I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

            "body": "Just picked up a used Rains Mountaineer backpack   ([https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag](https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag)) in very good condition, and wanted to post some pics and thoughts on the bag since I couldn't find much more info online. I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks.

            "body": "Just picked up a used Rains Mountaineer backpack   ([https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag](https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag)) in very good condition, and wanted to post some pics and thoughts on the bag since I couldn't find much more info online. I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

            "body": "I wanted to leave a review for this bag since I had a very hard time finding good reviews for this. \n\nPros: Overall the quality of the construction and materials seem good (hard to tell how long it'll last). I really loved the look of the bag and the two front compartments. I wanted something that felt comfortable to carry and didn't look too big on me (I'm short 5'1\"). \n\nCons: \n- it's a little tight inside. I wish it expanded even a few inches.\n- No side pockets \n\nHere's what I was able to pack in the main compartment: \n\n* my personal 13\" MacBook pro in the padded pocket\n* my work laptop (Macbook Air in slim sleeve)\n* Large Book (The Artist's Way)\n* A5 notebook\n* B5 thin notebook \n* waterbottle\n* tripod \n* headphones\n* case with for macbook keyboard &amp; mouse\n\nThe two front pockets:\n\n* I fit a tech accessory pouch (for cords, external hard drive, chargers, etc)",

        "selftext": "Hi there 😁 I'm currently looking for a backpack that will last (atleast 5 years) Which seems like a long time compared to the bags ive gotten in the past. but to be fair i didnt dish out too much on them, so i guess it worth doing a one time splash on a good bag that'll last\n\nI quite like the designs of the (stubble and co) backpacks and the (rains) roll top backpacks.\n\nId use it for work that (sometimes) can be taken on sites and a little dirty and roughed up but not too often and international flights. Preferable looking for something 20+ litres and in a black colourway, my budget is under £130\n\nfor local travels it'd just be laptop, books, papers, electronics such as headphones and maybe some comfy slippers. I did look at the previous two brands (mentioned above) but I'm not too sure on their long term durability and if they're just a brand that look nice and will fall apart after a year or two.\n\nThank you for taking your time to respond!\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi there 😁 I'm currently looking for a backpack that will last (atleast 5 years) Which seems like a long time compared to the bags ive gotten in the past. but to be fair i didnt dish out too much on them, so i guess it worth doing a one time splash on a good bag that'll last\n\nI quite like the designs of the (stubble and co) backpacks and the (rains) roll top backpacks.\n\nId use it for work that (sometimes) can be taken on sites and a little dirty and roughed up but not too often and international flights. Preferable looking for something 20+ litres and in a black colourway, my budget is under £130\n\nfor local travels it'd just be laptop, books, papers, electronics such as headphones and maybe some comfy slippers. I did look at the previous two brands (mentioned above) but I'm not too sure on their long term durability and if they're just a brand that look nice and will fall apart after a year or two.\n\nThank you for taking your time to respond!\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/69cj9t/review_rains_field_bag_waterproof_backpack/",
        "selftext": "## Background\n\nRains is a Danish company known for their rainwear (hence the name), and the backpack definitely has survived the tests I've given it. I live in Seattle where during this time of year there's a *little bit* of rain. A couple months ago I was on my way to work with my gym clothes in my Kanken backpack on a day that it was raining fairly hard, and when I got to work and opened my backpack I found that water had soaked through the lining and got my shoes and gym clothes wet. Since I already had a Rains jacket (which is great for not super heavy rain by the way), I figured I'd look into their bags which was how I came across this backpack.\n\n## Bag details, pictures, etc.\n\nNote that while this is supposed to be a review of Rains bag and not a comparison between this and the Kanken, I will make some comparisons since it seems like a lot of users on this sub own a Kanken or at least familiar with it.\n\n[Album with captions](https://imgur.com/a/JA7gc).\n\n### Size\n\n[Side-by-side comparison image](https://i.imgur.com/N2CsAuU.jpg).\n\n\n\nBag | Height | Width | Depth | Volume\n---|---|----|----|----\nRains | 45cm (17.7in) | 30.5cm (12in) | 13cm (5.1in) | 12.3L (3.5 gal)\nKanken (15\") | 40cm (15.75in) | 28cm (11in) | 16cm (6.3in) | 18L (4.75 gal)\n\nThe Rains bag does include a laptop sleeve and a smaller front-facing pocket, which is pretty sizable. If you look at the [full picture](https://i.imgur.com/N2CsAuU.jpg), the smaller front pocket extends all the way down to the bottom seam on the bag.\n\n### Material\n\n[Closeup Kanken](https://i.imgur.com/b1OJ6co.jpg)  \n[Closeup of Rains bag](https://i.imgur.com/16J0XRN.jpg)\n\nThe bag is made with a polyurethane (the shit you use to seal your wood floors) fabric exterior with poly fabric lining, while the Kanken is made with Vinylon-F. The one thing I noticed immediately when I got this bag was that the zipper seems pretty sealed. It's flat, and seems to not be very porous at all. You should be able to see this in the closeup.\n\nI did a water test to show how water flows off the bags. Not quite sure why because personally I don't think it shows anything but I didn't want the videos to go unused:\n\n- [Rains water test](https://gfycat.com/BeneficialVictoriousCaracal)\n- [Kanken water test](https://gfycat.com/UnconsciousScaryCanine)\n\n## Complaints\n\nReally have none. This bag is fantastic and has survived two crazy downpours here in Seattle. If anyone else here got caught in the rain today (5/4/2017) you'll probably think about how soaked you got. When I got home I checked my bag and I couldn't feel any water on the inside of the bag at all and as an added bonus the bag dries extremely quick.\n\nThe only *kind of complaint* I guess I'd have is that is that dirt from your shoes or whatever will probably show a lot easier. In [this picture for example](https://i.imgur.com/83RdILj.jpg) the white spot is a result of resting the sole of my shoe on my bag while I was on the bus (gross, I know). Pretty easy to clean with a wet cloth though. \n\n## Purchasing\n\nI bought this backpack off Revolve which currently has it listed for $77 for blue and green colors. Black is $110. Links:\n\n- [Black](http://www.revolve.com/rains-field-bag/dp/RAIR-UY18/?d=Womens&amp;page=1&amp;lc=1&amp;itrownum=1&amp;itcurrpage=1&amp;itview=01&amp;plpSrc=%2Fr%2FSearch.jsp%3Fsearch%3Drains%2Bfield%2Bbag%26d%3DWomens%26sortBy%3Dfeatured)\n- [Blue](http://www.revolve.com/rains-field-bag/dp/RAIR-UY19/?d=Womens&amp;page=1&amp;lc=2&amp;itrownum=1&amp;itcurrpage=1&amp;itview=01&amp;plpSrc=%2Fr%2FSearch.jsp%3Fsearch%3Drains%2Bfield%2Bbag%26d%3DWomens%26sortBy%3Dfeatured)\n- [Green](http://www.revolve.com/rains-field-bag/dp/RAIR-UY20/?d=Womens&amp;page=1&amp;lc=3&amp;itrownum=1&amp;itcurrpage=1&amp;itview=01&amp;plpSrc=%2Fr%2FSearch.jsp%3Fsearch%3Drains%2Bfield%2Bbag%26d%3DWomens%26sortBy%3Dfeatured)\n\n[Here's also a link direct from Rains](https://www.rains.com/collections/bags-accessories/products/field-bag?variant=30391437185) for € 81.00 ($88.95). They do ship to the US.\n\n",
