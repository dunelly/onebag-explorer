        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

The 2-Day isn’t a light bag itself. This definitely carries weight more comfortably for me, though. \n\nOne other note in comparison to the 2-Day: Since the top doesn’t have the tri-zip closure, it does take a few extra moments to access the interior compartment. I don’t mind this because I like the form factor better.",

The pockets on the blitz seem deep in comparison. I wasn’t worried at all about losing my Yeti bottle. I haven’t done a side-by-side on them, but these seem better. They are still wide, so I suspect I might want something to help keep my umbrella from sliding around, though I don’t think it’ll want to fall out. \n\nRegarding access, I have a Shimoda Action X30 that gets a lot of use right now for hiking with cameras. It is sort of a one-trick pony, though. It excels at carrying photo gear in a safe and still accessible way, but it is pretty meh for my other needs on a day hike. If you are looking for a great photo backpack, I can recommend that one (or its bigger sibling) strongly. \n\nThe access to gear in this pack seems like it will work well for me in many situations. I like ruck-style sack packs for lots of things, but they wouldn’t necessarily be my first choice for a dedicated photo pack. However, the full-height zip access here makes it work in more scenarios. I don’t know if it will replace my Shimoda for photo-gear-heavy day hikes, but it definitely could.",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

The 2-Day isn’t a light bag itself. This definitely carries weight more comfortably for me, though. \n\nOne other note in comparison to the 2-Day: Since the top doesn’t have the tri-zip closure, it does take a few extra moments to access the interior compartment. I don’t mind this because I like the form factor better.",

                "body": "I had the same issue with the bottle pockets in my 2-Day. I made elastic keepers and had a mini carabiner to help secure my small umbrella when I needed it. The pockets on the blitz seem deep in comparison. I wasn’t worried at all about losing my Yeti bottle. I haven’t done a side-by-side on them, but these seem better. They are still wide, so I suspect I might want something to help keep my umbrella from sliding around, though I don’t think it’ll want to fall out. \n\nRegarding access, I have a Shimoda Action X30 that gets a lot of use right now for hiking with cameras. It is sort of a one-trick pony, though. It excels at carrying photo gear in a safe and still accessible way, but it is pretty meh for my other needs on a day hike. If you are looking for a great photo backpack, I can recommend that one (or its bigger sibling) strongly. \n\nThe access to gear in this pack seems like it will work well for me in many situations. I like ruck-style sack packs for lots of things, but they wouldn’t necessarily be my first choice for a dedicated photo pack. However, the full-height zip access here makes it work in more scenarios. I don’t know if it will replace my Shimoda for photo-gear-heavy day hikes, but it definitely could.",

The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

They are still wide, so I suspect I might want something to help keep my umbrella from sliding around, though I don’t think it’ll want to fall out. \n\nRegarding access, I have a Shimoda Action X30 that gets a lot of use right now for hiking with cameras. It is sort of a one-trick pony, though. It excels at carrying photo gear in a safe and still accessible way, but it is pretty meh for my other needs on a day hike.

I like ruck-style sack packs for lots of things, but they wouldn’t necessarily be my first choice for a dedicated photo pack. However, the full-height zip access here makes it work in more scenarios.

The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them.

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front.

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3).

May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

The Explore v2 is almost perfect for me and I can’t wait to start taking it on new adventures. \n\nPacking list: \n\n•2 x TAD Huntsman Henley long sleeves\n\n•1 x TAD Traverse Tech Tee\n\n•1 x Icebreaker 200 merino Tee\n\n•2 x Pendleton Flannels\n\n•1 x Proof Rover Pant\n\n•1 x Arc’Teryx Cerium LT\n\n•1 x Arc’Teryx Gamma LT\n\n•1 x Long Johns\n\n•4 x Darn Tough socks\n\n•1 x Stance socks\n\n•5 x Ex-Officio Boxer Briefs \n\n•1 x Reef flip-flops\n\nTech:\n\n•Sony A7R IV\n\n•Sony 20mm f/1.8\n\n•Sony 70-200 f/4 (not pictured)\n\n•Sony 16-50 f/3.5-5.6 (APS-C) \n\n•GoPro Hero 9 Black\n\n•MacBook Pro 13”\n\n•Peak Designs Travel Tripod\n\n•AirPods \n\nWorn: \n\n•Western Rise AT Slim Pant\n\n•TAD Huntsman Henley \n\n•Pendleton Flannel\n\n•Carryology x White’s Boots\n\n•Carhartt beanie from my mom\n\nMisc.:\n\n•WANDRD Medium tech pouch with all my cables, filters, etc. \n\n•Peak Designs Slide\n\n•ISO: packable day pack (the smaller the footprint the better)",

This leaves me more space when I need to carry something else with me.\n\nRecently I was looking at Tenba Fulton All-weather rolltops.
