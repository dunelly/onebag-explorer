        "selftext": "I'm traveling through Scandinavia and found that although the 45L travel bag is probably the best I've traveled with however there were a few things I noticed. For being able to keep it small enough to fit under the seat on the plane I keep it snapped and in the smaller configuration. Only problem is the snaps will undo themselves and the form of the bag is compromised. Aside from aesthetics it will catch on the seat when pulling it out or placing it under. To keep it closed I've used the outside straps to hook and keep it snug and tight. \n\nI also used an extra strap to attach it to my rolling luggage which in my opinion is much better then the horizontal placement. And to secure my water bottle I have a carabiner to hold it in place. \n\nJust a few things I thought I'd share in case it helps any of you in your travels or in deciding which bag to buy. ",

It was just a little tight but if I had packed it better it would have fit. If it's in its full expanded size it will not fit. I have the large tech bag and I find that it can hold my extra battery, viture glasses, cables and charger. If I have to place it in the overhead I still have access to my essentials. \n\nBut to answer your question I've never used it as my primary bag, I always use it with a small roller luggage.",

The straps came with the bag and was a wonder!\n\nSecond picture is example of clothes I wore. I also carried a set of pajamas and 2 thermal tops that could be worn on its own or layered, because I get very cold easily. Temperatures were between 3-20 Deg celcius during my travels.\n\nThe bag weighed between 9-10kg in total and I had no problem lifting it up to the overhead, provided the overhead wasn't too high up.\n\nOther items I carried: \n- epilator \n- universal adapter\n- kindle\n- travel accessories (deflatable neck pillow, eye mask) \n\nNote: I also carried a brown satchel so not exactly one bag.",

Super comfortable but imagine after 3-5hrs of walking, you do need a sit. If I was less vain, and more practical I'd carry something flat instead. Also, they don't fit in the backpack so I have to wear them whenever I am carrying the backpack. \n\nThe other shoe I brought is a super lightweight, machine washable sneaker from Rockport.

The straps came with the bag and was a wonder!\n\nSecond picture is example of clothes I wore. I also carried a set of pajamas and 2 thermal tops that could be worn on its own or layered, because I get very cold easily. Temperatures were between 3-20 Deg celcius during my travels.\n\nThe bag weighed between 9-10kg in total and I had no problem lifting it up to the overhead, provided the overhead wasn't too high up.\n\nOther items I carried: \n- epilator \n- universal adapter\n- kindle\n- travel accessories (deflatable neck pillow, eye mask) \n\nNote: I also carried a brown satchel so not exactly one bag.",

Super comfortable but imagine after 3-5hrs of walking, you do need a sit. If I was less vain, and more practical I'd carry something flat instead. Also, they don't fit in the backpack so I have to wear them whenever I am carrying the backpack. \n\nThe other shoe I brought is a super lightweight, machine washable sneaker from Rockport.

It sounds like you're using travel backpack for EDC as well as travel which is something I might be interested in doing as well. Currently kind of torn between the everyday zip 20L but I think it might be a little bit too small and the 30L travel backpack.\n\nHow does the travel bag handle EDC? Is it possible to access the main compartment by just opening the zippers at the top like a more standard toploading bag or do you really have to put it down and unzip the whole panel to grab something out of it?\n\nAlso what does the travel backpack allow you to pack inside of it that the everyday zip couldn't handle?\n\nThanks in advance!",

The 45L is nice because its standard capacity is 35L and can go down to 30 where the 30L standard is 27L and expanded is 30 so its inly a tiny bit smaller VS the 45L fully packed down\n\nEdit: added some stuff after \"IMO\"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1haehim/review_of_peak_design_45l_coyote_onebag_experience/",
        "selftext": "Hey y‚Äôall! \n\nI‚Äôm a recent-ish converter to r/onebag! I want to share my experience, first with my gear review of my bag (Peak Design 45L Coyote), and then with some overall reflections of my experience as a new onebag member. I was really sucked into figuring out which bag I should get, so I hope this can also help folks considering the Peak Design 45L option. \n\nPERSONAL STATS FOR REFERENCE: I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô11 (180cm), and 140 lb (64kg) man, so I‚Äôm on the skinny side. I think my legs are on the slightly longer side (compared to my back). \n\nTRAVEL: \n- 2-week trip to Austria &amp; Germany in September\n- A handful of work trips (train travel)\n- 6-day trip (plane travel)\n\nREFERENCE 1: Aer Travel Pack 3\nAfter watching an ungodly amount of review videos, I ended up ordering both the ATP 3 and PD 45, and try to pack my stuff in both. \nI initially loved this bag based on how its appearance, the comfortable straps, and because I loveeeee my Aer City Pack 2. But I quickly realized that it couldn‚Äôt actually pack that much stuff, primarily because of the multiple compartments. So sadly I had to return the ATP3. \n\nREFERENCE 2: Cotopaxi Allpa\nI received this bag as a gift a while ago, and I only used it for one 2-week trip before selling it. This bag felt especially uncomfortable to carry on my back for some reason, and I‚Äôm not a fan of the design. I also hate that it didn‚Äôt have a water pouch. \n\nWHAT I HAVE IN MY BAG: \n- Eagle Creek packing cubes: 2 small + 1 medium\n- Sony headphones in its case\n- Chargers, external battery, Kindle, laptop\n- Aer Travel Kit 2 for toiletries\n- Matador packable backpack \n- A book\n\nPROS:\n- The layout makes sense to me, and is pretty intuitive! I find the top pockets in the front section to be especially helpful‚Äîfor my chargers, external battery, Kindle, meds, keys etc. I love the wide-open main compartment that functions like a luggage.\n- Good water pouches on the two sides. When I REALLY stuff the bag up, it does get difficult, but that‚Äôs on me. \n- The circulation for my back has been good, and I haven‚Äôt found myself sweating much on my back. This is in comparison to the Matador packable backpack, which definitely will build up a sweat on my back. However!! Please take this comment with a few grains of salt: my travel so far has been to relatively cool/cold places, and I don‚Äôt sweat that much. \n- Overall comfort level is quite nice. I think the sternum strap and hip belt distribute the weight on my body decently well. \n- I think the bag is so beautiful, and the material feels and looks very nice. \n- I was in Austria during its historic rain and flooding, so my entire time I was there it was pouring rain. This became a test for waterproofing, and all my stuff inside was completely dry! I think the Coyote material is extra weather-resistant too. \n\n\nCONS\n- The main critique of the bag straps somewhat holds true for me. Especially when my bag is packed and heavy, I can really feel the flimsiness of the strap. I think the weight distribution feels the absolute best in a very specific position, where my straps are in the middle of my shoulders. (If I pull it in too much, it definitely strains my shoulders). The straps also are starting to show some hairs. \n- Speaking of comfort level still, I do find this bag to get to the limit of comfort if I really pack the bag up. I‚Äôve had a handful of days where I walked around for an hour or two with it, and while my shoulders didn‚Äôt particularly hurt, I was very ready to not carry the bag anymore. \n- The straps that help me pull the bag up to match my shoulders (not sure what these are called) have these latches that help them stay intact. However, they are 2 individual pieces, and I already lost one piece! It doesn‚Äôt affect the functionality, but the unevenness bothers me a bit now though. \n- The multiple straps are slightly annoying to fold in, because I can never remember which order it goes on. \n- I don‚Äôt use the hidden mini-pocket for your passport etc, since I just use my Aer for that stuff. \n- Because access to the main compartment is on the back side, I have found myself forgetting to zip up the front side, causing the stuff to spill out when I flip the bag. \n- The buttons that shrink the bag down to a 30L don‚Äôt adhere to each other that well, even when there‚Äôs nothing around it to block it. I imagine that you need to REALLY underpack your bag for it to fully stick, but even then. The 35L standard mode has been the mode I use the most. \n- (Not really a con, and more an observation): Because the bag is in this yellow-brown color, it really stands out. This is great for spotting the bag, but I also realize that I look like a chameleon with the bag + my red winter jacket. So if color-matching your outfit matters to you at all, this is potentially worth considering. \n\nOVERALL: PEAK DESIGN 45 COYOTE\nI love this bag! I overall just feel very happy having this bag around‚Äîit is study, it looks good, it is very functional. However, because of the straps, I would hesitate to recommend it to folks who are on the thinner side, or are especially sensitive to heavy weight. As a skinny person, I definitely can see how someone without broad shoulders can find it especially annoying. I‚Äôll keep using this bag for the time being. Next time though, I‚Äôll definitely prioritize a bag with really good shoulder straps. I‚Äôm also curious to see how this bag will hold up when I travel to hotter climates. \n\nOVERALL: AS A ONEBAG CONVERT\nOh man, traveling with one bag is so liberating!! (Okay I have to confess, I do have my Aer travel pack on though, so it‚Äôs not ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù 1 bag‚Ä¶) \n\nGoing up and down the stairs, using the urinals, navigating, etc. Basically, having both hands free is so liberating. Also‚Äîgoing on planes, the staff don‚Äôt see my bag as a ‚Äúluggage,‚Äù so I‚Äôve been spared multiple times with having to check my bag. (I will say that it is definitely pushing it to put this bag underneath the seat. In the 30L format, maybe‚Ä¶) \n\nIt has also dramatically contained my overpacking tendencies. I did find myself pushing the limit of the bag when I ended up buying an item or two on my trips, but having the bag makes me very intentional about what I buy on trips. It‚Äôs also been very helpful for me to intentionally save space in the bag, knowing that I might need to buy stuff. (So the 30L initial mode is helpful for me‚Äîeven though for this bag it doesn‚Äôt work perfectly, as I mentioned). \n\nI hope this helps‚Äîand I would be glad to share any more of my experiences with the bag and/or any of my other gear! (The packable backpack, toiletries bag, travel pack etc‚Äîall of which I absolutely love). \n",

For a 1-2 hour flight you can easily have your laptop and charger on your lap or put away completely.\n\nMy main focus is whether the 30L is fine for the longer haul's 2+ hours on regularly sized planes. It seems like from the generous feedback from everyone here so far that the bag is mostly fine under the seat in front of you.",

That's about the limits of what I'd consider its length of use, but have used on anything from 2 day to 4 day trips with ease.  I have a medium packing cube, small packing cube, and small wash pouch in here and I can zip it down small and it fits anywhere.\n\nI love the top pocket for glasses, spare wall charger, or smaller items like my vitamins case and some cables.  I haven't found the straps to be uncomfortable, and I walked in it fully loaded from SeaTac airport to the train and into downtown Seattle, and several blocks to a hotel.  Really dig the fact that I can have my pack on my back, an Aer sling on my chest with other small needs, and that I have both my hands free and everything in line with my body (no duffle bag off to one side or the other) - helps me to help my kiddos when we travel with their junk as well.\n\nMine is in the City Edition camo Xpac material, I freaking love it, and its one of my favorite PD pieces.",
