I packed it with about 10 days worth of cold weather clothes and my photography gear. The straps/harness really are as comfortable as they claim, which is a huge plus and sigh of relief. I could have used those 5 extra litres that the v1 has, but I‚Äôll get a bit creative with my packing as needed. It definitely has a lot of neat features, lots of pockets and organization, and a good feel to it. \nI decided against my my veeeeeeeery close second, Atlas Packs Adventure, because it was sadly $150 more expensive and had a longer wait time.

            "body": "I went to Montreal to snowboard for three days this past weekend and wanted to pack everything I needed in one bag (although snowboard gears have to be in a separate bag). I used to toss everything in a couple of duffle bags and that worked, but this time I found a cheap flight out of Montreal so I wanted to see if my new backpack would work for air travel. Long story short, I ended up driving so I couldn't test it. But as for having one bag to travel with, this backpack served its purpose very well.\n\nI have been looking for one backpack that can be an EDC as well as a travel backpack. While Shimoda Explore V2 30 is a camera backpack, it doesn't have to be just a camera backpack and has almost everything I wanted out of a backpack from the reviews I read/watched and also was made with air travel in mind so I committed to buy. They don't ship to Canada so I used B&amp;H (free shipping to Canada but have to pay taxes) to import. I didn't buy the camera insert as I figured I would just toss my mirrorless Sony in the top compartment if I do decide to travel with it.\n\nI fit everything you see in the picture in the backpack. I packed snowboard pants + fleece top + snowboard jacket in the backpack and that was occupying most of the volume (about 60% of the backpack). I think I could have maybe sacrificed a t-shirt to make a room for a Nintendo Switch or something in the future. It is definitely viable to use this backpack for a weekend trip, maybe even for a week or two depending on how you pack.\n\nI also packed my go-to Xiaomi sling bag that I got from Ali Express for $20ish in the backpack. I could carry hot coffee and some snack (among other things) in that bag up the mountain and it's small enough so it doesn't get in the way and it's perfect. When I travel I can usually carry my camera, wallet, water bottle, etc in that sling bag as well. Rather comfortable and well made for the price.\n\nI didn't bring a laptop this time but I also wanted to make sure that I could carry my work laptop in this backpack when I bought this. I have a HP Elitebook 850 G6 (15.6\") as my work laptop and it does fit but very snugly so you won't be able to put that in with one hand or pull it out through the back panel. I think that would be the maximum size of laptop that this backpack can fit. Anything 13-14\" should be no problem at all.\n\nMost of the online reviews mention this but I just wanna comment on how comfortable this backpack is. It was 7kg when I finished packing (so I could use it as a carry-on on the low cost plane) and it definitely carries easier than other backpacks I've had in the past and that is without the included hip belt. Solid and thoughtful construction, enough pockets for charging wires and tech stuff (not pictured), great material and overall very happy with it. I am looking forward to travel with this backpack in the future now.",

I have a HP Elitebook 850 G6 (15.6\") as my work laptop and it does fit but very snugly so you won't be able to put that in with one hand or pull it out through the back panel. I think that would be the maximum size of laptop that this backpack can fit. Anything 13-14\" should be no problem at all.\n\nMost of the online reviews mention this but I just wanna comment on how comfortable this backpack is. It was 7kg when I finished packing (so I could use it as a carry-on on the low cost plane) and it definitely carries easier than other backpacks I've had in the past and that is without the included hip belt. Solid and thoughtful construction, enough pockets for charging wires and tech stuff (not pictured), great material and overall very happy with it. I am looking forward to travel with this backpack in the future now.",
