          "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

              "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

Agree with review, super high quality.  I am a bigger guy, so could very easily be used for EDC.  \n\nI am looking forward to using it for 1-2 night trips for sure, but I am not the most minimalist packer.  \n\nSomething about the peak design doesn’t suit my eye as well.  For me, I am going to use the HP 34L for shorter trips and some EDC and my 45L for longer trips.  Good luck!",

          "body": "Thank you for your thourough review.\r  \n\r  \nI am looking for a travel backpack for 2-5 days trips in summer (train, maybe airplane). Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ? Thanks a lot :)",

Thanks!\n\nI am also deciding between PD 45L and Heimplanet 34L. I like the flexibility, expandability, and features of PD, but it is heavier and many have complained it is not that comfortable. The Heimplanet feels like 80% of the features with better straps and comfort.\n\nI also struggle with a smaller daypack at the destination. I cannot imagine using even the smaller versions for daily EDC. And I hate those minimal packable/folding ones. Something like the Aer Go Pack or Tom Bihn Daylight might suffice, but would obviously take up more space and weight in the travel bag.",

          "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

              "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

Any items that are stored in it would have to be incredibly thin or get crushed, making it pretty much useless.

GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

              "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity.

GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag.

Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

              "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

          "body": "Thank you for your thourough review.\r  \n\r  \nI am looking for a travel backpack for 2-5 days trips in summer (train, maybe airplane). Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ? Thanks a lot :)",

Thanks!\n\nI am also deciding between PD 45L and Heimplanet 34L. I like the flexibility, expandability, and features of PD, but it is heavier and many have complained it is not that comfortable. The Heimplanet feels like 80% of the features with better straps and comfort.\n\nI also struggle with a smaller daypack at the destination. I cannot imagine using even the smaller versions for daily EDC. And I hate those minimal packable/folding ones. Something like the Aer Go Pack or Tom Bihn Daylight might suffice, but would obviously take up more space and weight in the travel bag.",

You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company.

          "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

              "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

That is the only part of the bag that I cannot understand. It doesn't look like it provides any compression. Any items that are stored in it would have to be incredibly thin or get crushed, making it pretty much useless. And rolling it up just takes away valuable space at the bottom of the bag.\n\nWithout owning the bag I can't get a better understanding of it's functionality, would you be able to provide some insight?",

I am a bigger guy, so could very easily be used for EDC.  \n\nI am looking forward to using it for 1-2 night trips for sure, but I am not the most minimalist packer.  \n\nSomething about the peak design doesn’t suit my eye as well.

This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

              "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options.

The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

              "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

That is the only part of the bag that I cannot understand. It doesn't look like it provides any compression. Any items that are stored in it would have to be incredibly thin or get crushed, making it pretty much useless. And rolling it up just takes away valuable space at the bottom of the bag.\n\nWithout owning the bag I can't get a better understanding of it's functionality, would you be able to provide some insight?",

Agree with review, super high quality.  I am a bigger guy, so could very easily be used for EDC.  \n\nI am looking forward to using it for 1-2 night trips for sure, but I am not the most minimalist packer.  \n\nSomething about the peak design doesn’t suit my eye as well.  For me, I am going to use the HP 34L for shorter trips and some EDC and my 45L for longer trips.  Good luck!",

Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ? Thanks a lot :)",

Thanks!\n\nI am also deciding between PD 45L and Heimplanet 34L. I like the flexibility, expandability, and features of PD, but it is heavier and many have complained it is not that comfortable. The Heimplanet feels like 80% of the features with better straps and comfort.\n\nI also struggle with a smaller daypack at the destination. I cannot imagine using even the smaller versions for daily EDC. And I hate those minimal packable/folding ones. Something like the Aer Go Pack or Tom Bihn Daylight might suffice, but would obviously take up more space and weight in the travel bag.",

The smaller motors on the old Stride and even Stride S were not of interest to me.  I've run on plenty of treadmills and know the horrible feeling of stressing a smaller motor at a body weight of 220-250lbs.  \n\nEverything is definitely not perfect.

Also, the rolling dials illuminated with green and blue LED lights (which are very cool!), are meant to change speed, incline, and volume, but I have not been able to get the volume dial to change the volume of the App despite working perfecting for the speed and incline.  I have already cancelled the membership on day one; this has no effect on the treadmill use other than seeing ads on the screen during my run instead of a class.  I'm not really concerned with the tablet or app because all of the speed, incline, distance, &amp; heart rate information are also shown in larger displays outside of the tablet.  That being said, the app does work well after touching the \"Remind Me Later\" button regarding the available update.  I ran a class before cancelling and it's cool, but not for me.  Our Peloton yells at me and when I run, I'd rather just zone out to tv, music, or silence instead of a class.\n\nEchelon is definitely not known for their customer service based on reviews for some of their other equipment, but people have had similar CS experiences with several of the manufacturers I was considering.  I don't want to throw any names in here, but I've owned machines by at least 8 different exercise equipment companies and not experienced what I would call great customer service with any of them.  The only reason I started to consider Echelon was because Costco sells a less foldable model of the Stride treadmill.",

I was thinking to purchase the same- quick question (weird question!), I can fit it in my space IF and only IF the length of the equipment is 5.4ft as mentioned on the specs... is the 5.4ft including the space for the monitor?  as it does tilt back on the picture and i have a wall that would go behind the screen so my 5.4ft space avaialble has to be incl. monitor tilt within this amount of space... otherwise the treadmill will extend to a walkway and i want to avoid this.",

I discovered by using a different pack that most days I can make due with an 18-22L pack, and want it to be nice and low profile.  Sometimes, I need closer to 26-30L pack.  The thing is, I don't want two packs for this: I figured out that basically, I still want everything I carry everyday in the 18-22L, and just want to add more stuff to it.  For example, if I'm going to a hotel for the night, I still want everything in my usual pack, plus throw in toiletries, pajamas, clothes for next day -- very ponderous to have to move my regular EDC back and forth between packs.\n\nSo of course, I started looking at the expandables, and then ruled them all out one by one for various reasons.   Then I saw the picture above, and realized maybe I'd been thinking about this the wrong way... maybe instead of a zip-open expandable pack, I could get a 26-30L pack with great compression straps, and just compress it down on lighter days.   Which is why the picture above is so intriguing.   This pack hits EVERY ONE of my other requirements.  Plus the compression straps don't block the zippers, which is one major annoyance removed.\n\nSo the question, for anyone who has this pack: do the compression straps really work as well as the above picture seems to show?  Have any of you with this pack compressed it down, and it stays as low-profile as that pic?  Do you (or would you) use the pack compressed?\n\nThanks for any help!",

The contrast lining is good but it's only in the secret and nested compartments, so the main compartment which sees most of the use is still black inside. Not sure how heavy the old hardware to make the change in weight worth noting. I do appreciate the more subtle logo. Curiously they didn't seem to address any of the critiques/suggestions from the packhacker review of the 1.0: A small clip or tightening mechanism on the side flaps would help it wear closer to your body, the zips look good but are a little small, turning the corner on the zips can be a little difficult. Note that I noticed all these issues when I first got the sling, but after using it a bit I haven't had any issues with how it fits, the zip size, or opening the sling, so maybe once you get the hang of it those \"issues\" go away.",

      "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jlv9jh/matador_globerider_35_black_full_review/",
      "selftext": "I obsessed over which one bag to buy for about a year.  Couple of times I decided “this is it”, but never pulled the trigger. Whichever bag it was at the time was either missing a feature or two on my wishlist, or had stuff I didn’t want, etc.  When the GlobeRider 35 dropped, it had pretty much the perfect magical mix (for me at least).  If anyone is interested in what my wishlist was and which ones i decided against and why, lmk and i can try to post it.\n\n\nSo buckle up fu*kleheads, here’s my review of the Matador GlobeRider35.\n\n\nI might not go over every single feature, especially if it’s well-covered elsewhere, but there’s a few things I tried especially to cover if i haven’t seen it in other reviews.\n\n\nOverall:     35L is the right size for me—i wanted something carry-on that would mostly fly under airline notice.  But I have stuff, and smaller capacity would mean sacrifices I don’t want to make.\n\nMaterials are top notch, I love Matador’s stretch mesh used on the front pocket and inside the admin pocket.  Buckles feel smooth; love the zipper pulls especially the differentiated white ones for the main compartment.  The water resistant material and coated zips mean i don’t have to carry a rain fly or stress if there’s a light shower.  Overall style for the black colorway is subtle but sexy.\n\nWeight without the hip belt is 3lbs; i don’t plan on using it unless i have a trip with a lot of walking around or stairs but it also tucks away nicely if needed (see pics).  Have a couple pieces of cardboard to slip in on either side to keep the Velcro from reengaging as you remove, otherwise it’s near impossible.\n\n\nPockets:     The right amount of pockets.  Fleece-lined pocket on the top means nothing gets smooshed, and it’s perfect for keeping airpods and phone going while going through security.  \n\nI personally don’t like an admin panel that goes all the way to the bottom; I’d rather have that capacity on inside lid pockets.  (See pics) I took a pic of the capacity with a charger inside for scale, the gusset is an ovoid shape that’s wider in the middle and tapers down at the ends.  \n4 pen slots is a waste, i don’t have anything else besides a pen and lip balm that would need it and would have preferred a third larger pocket.  Kinda want to take a seam ripper to one of them and make a third bigger pocket instead. If I did it, should I do it all the way to the left, in between the two pen slots, or closest to the bigger slots?\nKindle and switch fit no problem, could probably fit a switch case but probably not other larger tech.  Steam deck is definitely too big, but you’d be able to fit at the top of the main compartment and easily get to it with the top access zip.  \n\nGreat little smuggler’s pocket on the back for passport and cash (see pic), you’d never know it was there unless already familiar with the bag (wished it was RFID too).  \n\nWater bottle pocket is also stretch mesh and should hold most sizes well.  If the bottle has a handle the compression strap can thread through it.\n\nOutside stuff pocket is made of that same really nice stretch mesh, great spot for a jacket. I have an old Patagonia with a bungee cord, but never liked using it for clothes, felt too bulky.  The only thing I REALLY wish Matador would have done is to add the same zipper that the Refraction packable backpack has on its outside pocket.\n\n\nMain Area:     Organization is just what I wanted personally.  Big clamshell opening, room for packing cubes.  I don’t usually travel with a laptop, so to me a separate tech area is wasted space.  A sleeve on the back with the magnetic closure is perfect for an iPad or if i do need to bring a laptop on a work trip.  Dual access is great, the laptop sleeve is really only accessible from the top OR from the separate laptop zipper (which itself doesn’t give access to the main area).  \n\nTop 2 inside mesh pockets don’t have capacity.  Middle and bottom zip pockets do (see pics), but it’s slightly different volume for each.  The middle zip pocket shares the ovoid gusset with the outside admin pocket, and there’s the same shaped gusset at the bottom.  The lowest zip pocket shares this gusset but at the bottom of the pack the mesh just meets with the lid, no gusset.  So the middle mesh zip pocket has the most room.\n\nI like that there are compression straps that DON’T interfere with getting into the main area.  \n\n\nBack/Harness:  Really comfortable, cushy straps.  Load lifters are a must for me; most packs i like aren’t designed for women, and load lifters help dial in the fit.  Matador take note—don’t make it pink or change any of the features, but offer a version with more S-curved straps.  Anyone with breast tissue would love it.  \n\nNo notes on the sternum strap; allows for micro adjustments and doesn’t seem like it’ll move around much but time will tell.  \n\nFor a $290 price (I paid $260 with a code), why no cord keepers besides the sternum strap?!?  I wish they had them for the harness straps, hip belt, and top compression straps.  I’m going to see what i can rig up with gaffers tape or the ones from Tom Binh, but in this price range i shouldn’t have to.  If you don’t have hips, the mesh pockets on the hip belt will manage that dangle at least.\n\nThe side laptop zipper isn’t easily lockable, which is odd, but a small TSA lock will fit between the metal part and the loop for top compression strap (see pic).  I don’t usually travel with a laptop and the bag will always be carryon only, but why wouldn’t they dedicate a way to secure your most expensive tech?  \n\nOn a similar note, forgot to mention that the top main access zipper has theft protection loops on BOTH ends, so you can secure on whichever side you want. \n\n\nTLDR:  I love this bag—it checks almost every box i had in a very long list, and none of the small nitpicks are even close to dealbreakers.  Can’t wait to take this with me to Mexico in a few months. Happy to answer any questions if there’s anything else you want to know!",

Since we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel regards being able to leave the house and - whisper it - leave the country, I thought I would post an updated version of my packing list for indefinite travel. Suitable for any climate down to about -5 C. This is basically the max I would take. If I went to SE Asia for example I would ditch one pair of pants/the heavy base-layer, a couple of pairs of socks and one or two other items.\n\nIt would fit in a smaller bag for sure, but as I often travel with family, extra space is required.\n\nMain bag is Osprey FP 40.\n\nIt can all pack away at about 7kg if needed for the Asian airlines. Sling can easily fit within main bag and still remain under 7kg for flights (I might be wearing a layer or two extra then ;) )\n\nFeedback welcome.\n\nYou can see the full list here (should be read only):\n\n[https://www.notion.so/f3aeba1d5d4e4c728f2cf540ed5f646d?v=e147992e63d44f1a886aa05c3750cc31](https://www.notion.so/f3aeba1d5d4e4c728f2cf540ed5f646d?v=e147992e63d44f1a886aa05c3750cc31)\n\n[Cube L - 2 x Merino Ts, 1 Heattech warm base layer, Synthetic jeans, 2 x shorts](https://preview.redd.it/mbjvr9qtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be61d4be8ee5feeb07755253b97796200439258)\n\n[Cube M - Utilities - Rain jacket, packable rucksack, microfibre towel, string bag, pouch](https://preview.redd.it/wy4zvlqtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=532e608356168f56f034170fa7239d6b5f933dc6)\n\n[Cube S - 5x Airism, 4x merino socks](https://preview.redd.it/7g17jestwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c757787c14f1976e57420bbc3e58da45473fb920)\n\n[Toiletries\\/Laundry - Muji case, incl. mesh bag for machine wash, wash line, stopper](https://preview.redd.it/beq2hostwcw61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a49ff501374c81046948932adc6cbcbf14a072d)\n\n[EDC - Sling - Including first aid kit, headphones, masks, multitool, torch etc.](https://preview.redd.it/6p7b98vtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9add058ae8db4a31f0b681c115ba9fd21d49899)\n\n[Synthetic jeans,  jacket, buff, hoodie, belt, airism, T, merino socks, shoes](https://preview.redd.it/zoszv4rtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be8457d42ead8530691d76ea9871743b0880e439)\n\n[Extras - waterproof bags, water bottle, rain cover, masks, hat, ipad, flip flops](https://preview.redd.it/sw52sivtwcw61.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ff4e533067fd4d21325698ad32d150589fb8ac)\n\n[Ready to Fly](https://preview.redd.it/w6rom8qtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4398e26807eca2f9ee2f7b19eccfa73fba1425)",

            "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

                "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ?

Thanks!\n\nI am also deciding between PD 45L and Heimplanet 34L. I like the flexibility, expandability, and features of PD, but it is heavier and many have complained it is not that comfortable. The Heimplanet feels like 80% of the features with better straps and comfort.\n\nI also struggle with a smaller daypack at the destination. I cannot imagine using even the smaller versions for daily EDC. And I hate those minimal packable/folding ones. Something like the Aer Go Pack or Tom Bihn Daylight might suffice, but would obviously take up more space and weight in the travel bag.",

            "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

                "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

Any items that are stored in it would have to be incredibly thin or get crushed, making it pretty much useless. And rolling it up just takes away valuable space at the bottom of the bag.\n\nWithout owning the bag I can't get a better understanding of it's functionality, would you be able to provide some insight?",

I am a bigger guy, so could very easily be used for EDC.  \n\nI am looking forward to using it for 1-2 night trips for sure, but I am not the most minimalist packer.  \n\nSomething about the peak design doesn’t suit my eye as well.  For me, I am going to use the HP 34L for shorter trips and some EDC and my 45L for longer trips.  Good luck!",

Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ?

            "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

                "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

                "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

Agree with review, super high quality.  I am a bigger guy, so could very easily be used for EDC.  \n\nI am looking forward to using it for 1-2 night trips for sure, but I am not the most minimalist packer.  \n\nSomething about the peak design doesn’t suit my eye as well.  For me, I am going to use the HP 34L for shorter trips and some EDC and my 45L for longer trips.  Good luck!",

Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ? Thanks a lot :)",

Thanks!\n\nI am also deciding between PD 45L and Heimplanet 34L. I like the flexibility, expandability, and features of PD, but it is heavier and many have complained it is not that comfortable. The Heimplanet feels like 80% of the features with better straps and comfort.\n\nI also struggle with a smaller daypack at the destination. I cannot imagine using even the smaller versions for daily EDC. And I hate those minimal packable/folding ones. Something like the Aer Go Pack or Tom Bihn Daylight might suffice, but would obviously take up more space and weight in the travel bag.",

You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent.

Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ?

            "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

                "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company.

I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

            "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag.

            "body": "Hey folks, below is my full review for Heimplanet Travel Pack 34L. You can check my blog for more pictures at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/heimplanet-transit-line-travel-pack-34l-review)\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased in Hamburg, Germany, Heimplanet is a fascinating company. Founded over a decade ago, it pursued a simple goal: to improve your travel experience. The first product they launched was an innovative, futuristic-looking inflatable tent cleverly called The Cave. With time, the company diversified and created a rich and sophisticated product line ranging from apparel, to accessories and of course bags.\n\nToday I have one of the most popular and fine-tuned products Heimplanet has released to date, the Transit Line Travel Pack 34L backpack.\n\nHow does it fare against intense competition? Should you consider it as your trusty travel bag?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Anyone looking for a well-built and smartly organized carry-on backpack would quickly grow to love the pragmatic yet efficient built-in organization of the Transit Line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Those who appreciate innovative materials that are also eco-friendly and sustainable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you like easy packing, you will find the clamshell opening of the Transit Line to be perfect for both visibility and accessibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* People with a larger frame who like oversized EDC bags will find the Transit Line a very capable daily pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The 34L version might look too big on people with smaller frames, luckily there is also a 28L version of the bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* PRICE: 233 EUR (\\~$280)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 53 x 34 x 19 cm (21 x 13 x 7 inch)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1,66 kg (3.4 lbs)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 34L\n\n\\* COLOR OPTIONS: Castle Rock Grey, Black\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**COMFORT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found the overall comfort of the bag to be excellent. The straps are wide and lightly padded, the included load lifters help distribute the weight better and the removable waist belt helps secure the bag on your body and further enhances the weight distribution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of the Travel Pack features a nicely designed foam that looks cool but does not offer much air channel for ventilation. The bag was tested during winter so a sweaty back was not an issue, but should be considered during warmer weather.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the pack has one of the best sternum strap designs on the market: an elastic part for improved breathability and a nice WooJin magnetic buckle for effortless use. A small but very appreciated detail is the sternum strap that has an elastic strap keeper to prevent dangling of excess fabric.\n\nThe Travel Pack hits a delicate balance between the number of features and the actual usefulness/usability of those. Surprisingly, the bag ticks almost all the boxes one could imagine for a perfect travel pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClamshell opening has become the most convenient way to pack the back and unsurprisingly the Travel Pack utilizes this design. \n\nA side handle for convenient brief-mode carry \n\nOne external water bottle has a nice stretchy fabric that can accommodate larger water bottles (32 OZ nalgene fit just fine) and is barely noticeable when empty.\n\nA quick access pocket on top of the bag with also a front flat pocket is everything I could possibly ask to store my most commonly used items without the need to go inside the bag.\n\nThe separation of the main capacity into 2 compartments: one for tech organization and the other as a clothes compartment .\n\nThe ability to roll away the internal divider, making the bag a single compartment bag, is very useful when you need to maximise the capacity of the bag and simplify the layout further",

                "body": "**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe materials are superb across the board. Heimplanet went an extra mile to create a special fabric in-house, named DYECOSHELL, which is also dope dyed. Such fabric allows to save water, CO2, energy and chemicals thanks to the special process of adding colorant to the polymer melt during spinning.  Not only extremely sustainable, but the fabric also has excellent water and abrasion resistant properties.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardware is great too, industry leading YKK zippers and custom metal hardware help reinforce the confidence in the bag and its durability.\n\nThe organization is just right:\n\nExternally, there are two zipped pockets at your disposal and also a number of attachment points that can be utilized to secure things outside the bag. A single water bottle pocket gives the bag an interesting asymmetrical shape.\n\nInternal organization features a nicely padded and suspended 15 inch laptop compartment and a number of pockets and small compartments to stay organized. I was glad to see a conservative number of pockets inside since forgetting where I put what is a frustrating experience that I don’t recommend to anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALTERNATIVES TO CONSIDER**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAble Carry Max [https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084013169) is similarly priced  ($260), yet slightly smaller at 30L capacity. The Max also features 2 compartments (separating your office and your clothes), clamshell opening and thoughtful organization. It does have a more technical look, while Heimplanet Travel Pack is more formal and business-friendly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGoruck GR2 34L  [https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652](https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2/products/gr2-usa?variant=32880107159652) at $375 (for US-made version) and noticeably heavier, the GR2 has an external access to laptop, velcro panel on top front for personalization and a very rugged build that invites you to abuse the bag and be amazed by how much beating it can take and still look new. GR2 (and most Goruck bags) are notorious for being stiff out of the box requiring a breaking in period to become comfortable to carry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBellroy Transit Line 28L and 38L [https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura\\_nylon\\_recycled/black#slide-7](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-backpack-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-7)  is an excellent alternative if you are looking for a more business-friendly travel bag. Cleaner lines, a bit more organization and signature Bellroy design is easy to fall for. Unlike the Heimplanet Travel Pack I would not recommend taking the Bellroy on a hike or abusing it much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoundary Supply Arris [https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/arris-pack) at 35L this modular pack offers a very clean and unmistakably technical look with some bright color options. At $399 it’s definitely an investment but the modular accessories allow more flexibility and personalization compared to Heimplanet Travel Pack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials throughout\n* Balanced and useful built-in organization with enough external access and somewhat configurable internal organization\n* Sustainable, eco-friendly materials used in the bag are a testament to the continuous innovation of Heimplanet\n* Extremely weather resistant\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHypalon attachment points are finicky (if you need to remove or adjust the sternum strap or the waist strap)\n\nThe slanted bottom of the pack means it won't stand by itself and will topple over. This can be rectified by hanging the back via carabiner or simply getting used to leaning it against the wall/furniture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**VERDICT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Heimplanet Travel Pack is an excellent bag that can be used for short trips and even as a larger everyday carry solution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith smart thoughtful organization, sustainable materials, a durable build without looking technical the bag can be used for business trips and can hold its own in the outdoors. Striking such a delicate balance is no small feat and Heimplanet nailed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite some fierce competition and very interesting alternatives, the Heimplanet Travel Pack remains a strong offering for anyone who is in the market for a versatile and comfortable travel bag.",

Any items that are stored in it would have to be incredibly thin or get crushed, making it pretty much useless. And rolling it up just takes away valuable space at the bottom of the bag.\n\nWithout owning the bag I can't get a better understanding of it's functionality, would you be able to provide some insight?",

Agree with review, super high quality.  I am a bigger guy, so could very easily be used for EDC.  \n\nI am looking forward to using it for 1-2 night trips for sure, but I am not the most minimalist packer.  \n\nSomething about the peak design doesn’t suit my eye as well.  For me, I am going to use the HP 34L for shorter trips and some EDC and my 45L for longer trips.  Good luck!",

Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ? Thanks a lot :)",

Thanks!\n\nI am also deciding between PD 45L and Heimplanet 34L. I like the flexibility, expandability, and features of PD, but it is heavier and many have complained it is not that comfortable. The Heimplanet feels like 80% of the features with better straps and comfort.\n\nI also struggle with a smaller daypack at the destination. I cannot imagine using even the smaller versions for daily EDC. And I hate those minimal packable/folding ones. Something like the Aer Go Pack or Tom Bihn Daylight might suffice, but would obviously take up more space and weight in the travel bag.",

Any items that are stored in it would have to be incredibly thin or get crushed, making it pretty much useless. And rolling it up just takes away valuable space at the bottom of the bag.\n\nWithout owning the bag I can't get a better understanding of it's functionality, would you be able to provide some insight?",

I am a bigger guy, so could very easily be used for EDC.  \n\nI am looking forward to using it for 1-2 night trips for sure, but I am not the most minimalist packer.  \n\nSomething about the peak design doesn’t suit my eye as well.  For me, I am going to use the HP 34L for shorter trips and some EDC and my 45L for longer trips.  Good luck!",

Currently I have an eye at this Heimplanet and also the Peak Design 30L and 45L travel backpacks. In addition I have checked the bellroy transit backpack. I am absolutely torn in between these, I dont like the bellroy as much as the Peak Design and Heimplanet though (I am from the EU so no AER for me).\r  \n\r  \nDo you think this heimplanet 34 would be suitable for edc at the destination or is it simply too big for that. I am also thinking of packing a smaller packable backpack for daily use. Another alternative is that I could pick up the Peak design 30L (27L closed, 33 expanded) and when needed I would combine it with their duffel bag or when not needed use it as a edc at destination withou secondary bags.\r  \n\r  \nMy main aim is to have a universal backpack for shorter trips but also to be able to pack it for the maximum of 4-5 days approx.\r  \n\r  \nWhat are your thoughts, which would suit me the best ? Thanks a lot :)",

Thanks!\n\nI am also deciding between PD 45L and Heimplanet 34L. I like the flexibility, expandability, and features of PD, but it is heavier and many have complained it is not that comfortable. The Heimplanet feels like 80% of the features with better straps and comfort.\n\nI also struggle with a smaller daypack at the destination. I cannot imagine using even the smaller versions for daily EDC. And I hate those minimal packable/folding ones. Something like the Aer Go Pack or Tom Bihn Daylight might suffice, but would obviously take up more space and weight in the travel bag.",

I discovered by using a different pack that most days I can make due with an 18-22L pack, and want it to be nice and low profile.  Sometimes, I need closer to 26-30L pack.  The thing is, I don't want two packs for this: I figured out that basically, I still want everything I carry everyday in the 18-22L, and just want to add more stuff to it.  For example, if I'm going to a hotel for the night, I still want everything in my usual pack, plus throw in toiletries, pajamas, clothes for next day -- very ponderous to have to move my regular EDC back and forth between packs.\n\nSo of course, I started looking at the expandables, and then ruled them all out one by one for various reasons.   Then I saw the picture above, and realized maybe I'd been thinking about this the wrong way... maybe instead of a zip-open expandable pack, I could get a 26-30L pack with great compression straps, and just compress it down on lighter days.   Which is why the picture above is so intriguing.   This pack hits EVERY ONE of my other requirements.  Plus the compression straps don't block the zippers, which is one major annoyance removed.\n\nSo the question, for anyone who has this pack: do the compression straps really work as well as the above picture seems to show?  Have any of you with this pack compressed it down, and it stays as low-profile as that pic?  Do you (or would you) use the pack compressed?\n\nThanks for any help!",

I don't really use the secret compartments so the second compartment doesn't really do anything for me, but it's essentially a free option as it doesn't take up any extra space. The contrast lining is good but it's only in the secret and nested compartments, so the main compartment which sees most of the use is still black inside. Not sure how heavy the old hardware to make the change in weight worth noting. I do appreciate the more subtle logo. Curiously they didn't seem to address any of the critiques/suggestions from the packhacker review of the 1.0: A small clip or tightening mechanism on the side flaps would help it wear closer to your body, the zips look good but are a little small, turning the corner on the zips can be a little difficult. Note that I noticed all these issues when I first got the sling, but after using it a bit I haven't had any issues with how it fits, the zip size, or opening the sling, so maybe once you get the hang of it those \"issues\" go away.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jlv9jh/matador_globerider_35_black_full_review/",
        "selftext": "I obsessed over which one bag to buy for about a year.  Couple of times I decided “this is it”, but never pulled the trigger. Whichever bag it was at the time was either missing a feature or two on my wishlist, or had stuff I didn’t want, etc.  When the GlobeRider 35 dropped, it had pretty much the perfect magical mix (for me at least).  If anyone is interested in what my wishlist was and which ones i decided against and why, lmk and i can try to post it.\n\n\nSo buckle up fu*kleheads, here’s my review of the Matador GlobeRider35.\n\n\nI might not go over every single feature, especially if it’s well-covered elsewhere, but there’s a few things I tried especially to cover if i haven’t seen it in other reviews.\n\n\nOverall:     35L is the right size for me—i wanted something carry-on that would mostly fly under airline notice.  But I have stuff, and smaller capacity would mean sacrifices I don’t want to make.\n\nMaterials are top notch, I love Matador’s stretch mesh used on the front pocket and inside the admin pocket.  Buckles feel smooth; love the zipper pulls especially the differentiated white ones for the main compartment.  The water resistant material and coated zips mean i don’t have to carry a rain fly or stress if there’s a light shower.  Overall style for the black colorway is subtle but sexy.\n\nWeight without the hip belt is 3lbs; i don’t plan on using it unless i have a trip with a lot of walking around or stairs but it also tucks away nicely if needed (see pics).  Have a couple pieces of cardboard to slip in on either side to keep the Velcro from reengaging as you remove, otherwise it’s near impossible.\n\n\nPockets:     The right amount of pockets.  Fleece-lined pocket on the top means nothing gets smooshed, and it’s perfect for keeping airpods and phone going while going through security.  \n\nI personally don’t like an admin panel that goes all the way to the bottom; I’d rather have that capacity on inside lid pockets.  (See pics) I took a pic of the capacity with a charger inside for scale, the gusset is an ovoid shape that’s wider in the middle and tapers down at the ends.  \n4 pen slots is a waste, i don’t have anything else besides a pen and lip balm that would need it and would have preferred a third larger pocket.  Kinda want to take a seam ripper to one of them and make a third bigger pocket instead. If I did it, should I do it all the way to the left, in between the two pen slots, or closest to the bigger slots?\nKindle and switch fit no problem, could probably fit a switch case but probably not other larger tech.  Steam deck is definitely too big, but you’d be able to fit at the top of the main compartment and easily get to it with the top access zip.  \n\nGreat little smuggler’s pocket on the back for passport and cash (see pic), you’d never know it was there unless already familiar with the bag (wished it was RFID too).  \n\nWater bottle pocket is also stretch mesh and should hold most sizes well.  If the bottle has a handle the compression strap can thread through it.\n\nOutside stuff pocket is made of that same really nice stretch mesh, great spot for a jacket. I have an old Patagonia with a bungee cord, but never liked using it for clothes, felt too bulky.  The only thing I REALLY wish Matador would have done is to add the same zipper that the Refraction packable backpack has on its outside pocket.\n\n\nMain Area:     Organization is just what I wanted personally.  Big clamshell opening, room for packing cubes.  I don’t usually travel with a laptop, so to me a separate tech area is wasted space.  A sleeve on the back with the magnetic closure is perfect for an iPad or if i do need to bring a laptop on a work trip.  Dual access is great, the laptop sleeve is really only accessible from the top OR from the separate laptop zipper (which itself doesn’t give access to the main area).  \n\nTop 2 inside mesh pockets don’t have capacity.  Middle and bottom zip pockets do (see pics), but it’s slightly different volume for each.  The middle zip pocket shares the ovoid gusset with the outside admin pocket, and there’s the same shaped gusset at the bottom.  The lowest zip pocket shares this gusset but at the bottom of the pack the mesh just meets with the lid, no gusset.  So the middle mesh zip pocket has the most room.\n\nI like that there are compression straps that DON’T interfere with getting into the main area.  \n\n\nBack/Harness:  Really comfortable, cushy straps.  Load lifters are a must for me; most packs i like aren’t designed for women, and load lifters help dial in the fit.  Matador take note—don’t make it pink or change any of the features, but offer a version with more S-curved straps.  Anyone with breast tissue would love it.  \n\nNo notes on the sternum strap; allows for micro adjustments and doesn’t seem like it’ll move around much but time will tell.  \n\nFor a $290 price (I paid $260 with a code), why no cord keepers besides the sternum strap?!?  I wish they had them for the harness straps, hip belt, and top compression straps.  I’m going to see what i can rig up with gaffers tape or the ones from Tom Binh, but in this price range i shouldn’t have to.  If you don’t have hips, the mesh pockets on the hip belt will manage that dangle at least.\n\nThe side laptop zipper isn’t easily lockable, which is odd, but a small TSA lock will fit between the metal part and the loop for top compression strap (see pic).  I don’t usually travel with a laptop and the bag will always be carryon only, but why wouldn’t they dedicate a way to secure your most expensive tech?  \n\nOn a similar note, forgot to mention that the top main access zipper has theft protection loops on BOTH ends, so you can secure on whichever side you want. \n\n\nTLDR:  I love this bag—it checks almost every box i had in a very long list, and none of the small nitpicks are even close to dealbreakers.  Can’t wait to take this with me to Mexico in a few months. Happy to answer any questions if there’s anything else you want to know!",

This is why I like load lifters, cinching those in all the way really help pull it in to my back and keep it from feeling bulky. I think some break in time will also help. \n\nTaking the frame sheet out might make it feel smaller? But not recommended if you plan on using the hip belt to help transfer weight.\n\nETA: what other bags have you looked at? So many seem great but look like they really wouldn’t have worked on my frame.",

Since we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel regards being able to leave the house and - whisper it - leave the country, I thought I would post an updated version of my packing list for indefinite travel. Suitable for any climate down to about -5 C. This is basically the max I would take. If I went to SE Asia for example I would ditch one pair of pants/the heavy base-layer, a couple of pairs of socks and one or two other items.\n\nIt would fit in a smaller bag for sure, but as I often travel with family, extra space is required.\n\nMain bag is Osprey FP 40.\n\nIt can all pack away at about 7kg if needed for the Asian airlines. Sling can easily fit within main bag and still remain under 7kg for flights (I might be wearing a layer or two extra then ;) )\n\nFeedback welcome.\n\nYou can see the full list here (should be read only):\n\n[https://www.notion.so/f3aeba1d5d4e4c728f2cf540ed5f646d?v=e147992e63d44f1a886aa05c3750cc31](https://www.notion.so/f3aeba1d5d4e4c728f2cf540ed5f646d?v=e147992e63d44f1a886aa05c3750cc31)\n\n[Cube L - 2 x Merino Ts, 1 Heattech warm base layer, Synthetic jeans, 2 x shorts](https://preview.redd.it/mbjvr9qtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1be61d4be8ee5feeb07755253b97796200439258)\n\n[Cube M - Utilities - Rain jacket, packable rucksack, microfibre towel, string bag, pouch](https://preview.redd.it/wy4zvlqtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=532e608356168f56f034170fa7239d6b5f933dc6)\n\n[Cube S - 5x Airism, 4x merino socks](https://preview.redd.it/7g17jestwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c757787c14f1976e57420bbc3e58da45473fb920)\n\n[Toiletries\\/Laundry - Muji case, incl. mesh bag for machine wash, wash line, stopper](https://preview.redd.it/beq2hostwcw61.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a49ff501374c81046948932adc6cbcbf14a072d)\n\n[EDC - Sling - Including first aid kit, headphones, masks, multitool, torch etc.](https://preview.redd.it/6p7b98vtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9add058ae8db4a31f0b681c115ba9fd21d49899)\n\n[Synthetic jeans,  jacket, buff, hoodie, belt, airism, T, merino socks, shoes](https://preview.redd.it/zoszv4rtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be8457d42ead8530691d76ea9871743b0880e439)\n\n[Extras - waterproof bags, water bottle, rain cover, masks, hat, ipad, flip flops](https://preview.redd.it/sw52sivtwcw61.jpg?width=6000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ff4e533067fd4d21325698ad32d150589fb8ac)\n\n[Ready to Fly](https://preview.redd.it/w6rom8qtwcw61.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc4398e26807eca2f9ee2f7b19eccfa73fba1425)",
