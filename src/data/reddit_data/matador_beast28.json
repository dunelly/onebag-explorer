I‚Äôve included my packing list below and some photos :) I really love this community and how much inspiration it has given when planning/packing for this tripüíõ Also, we are a queer/lesbian couple so if you have any advice for country recommendations or safety precautions I‚Äôm all ears! \n\nBAG:\n\nMatador Beast 28 L\n\nCLOTHING:\n\nBlack Tank Top x2\n\nBlack Tube Top x 1\n\nBlack Long Sleeve Shrug x 1 (yoga material) \n\nBlack Zip Up Vest x 1\n\nCream One Shoulder Top x 1\n\nBlack Outdoor Voices RekTrek Zip Pants x 1\n\nBlack Athletic Shorts x 1 \n\nWhite Linen Button Down x 1\n\nGrey Hanes Tank for Sleeping x 1 \n\nBoxers for Sleeping x 1\n\nLeggings x 1 (donate after colder months) \n\nSweatshirt x (donate after colder months)\n\nRain Jacket x 1\n\nUNDERGARMENTS:\n\nUnderwear x 7\n\nWorkout socks x2\n\nWool socks x 1 (possibly donate after cold)\n\nSwimsuit x 1\n\nTOILETRIES:\n \nToothbrush x 1\n\nTravel toothpaste x1 \n\nShampoo x 1\n\nConditioner x 1\n\nDr. Bronners Soap for Body x 1\n\nDr. Bronners Soap to Wash Clothes x 1\n\nHair Brush x 1\n\nDeodorant x 1\n\nHair Gel x 1\n\nMakeup Kit x 1\n\nHair Clips x 2\n\nRazor w/ 3 Replacement Blades x1\n\nMakeup Remover Pad x 1\n\nTretinion x 4\n\nBody Lotion x 1\n\nSunscreen x 2\n\nFace Lotion x 1\n\nTweezers x 1\n\nPaula‚Äôs Choice Liquid Exfoliant x 1\n\nSHOES:\n\nKeen Women‚Äôs Zerraport II\n\nFIRST AID KIT:\n\nBand Aids x 10\n\nPepto Bismol x 1 bottle\n\nMagnesium x 1 bottle\n\nIbuprofen x 1 bottle\n\nLotrimin x 1 tube\n\nCortizone Cream x 1 tube \n\nIBS pills x 1 bottle\n\nWellness Formula x 1 bottle\n\nBaggu Bag (crossbody):\nVelcro Wallet x 1\n\nBaggu Grocery Bag x 1\n\nTravel Deo x 1\n\nHand Sanitizer x 1\n\nTravel Sunscreen x 1 \n\nVaseline x 2\n\nGum x 2\n\nTECH: \n\nAirTag x 2\n\nKindle x 1\n\niPhone 12 Max Plus x 1\n\nHeadphones x 1\n\nConverter x 1\n\nFan/flashlight/portable charger x 1\n\nMISC:\n\nBaggu Foldable Hat x 1\n\nBucket Hat x 1\n\nSunglasses x 1\n\nSleep Mask x 1\n\nNeck Pillow x 1\n\nKleenex x 3\n\nMaster Lock x 2\n\nUnigear Rain Fly x 1\n\nNotebook x 2\n\nFoldable Water Bottle x 1\n\nMasks x 3\n\nPen x 1\n\nFrogg Togg Sport Rag x 1\n\nStasher bags x 2\n\nBeach Towel x 1\n\nShower Towel x 1\n\nOsprey Daypack x 1\n\nSecret Fanny Pack x 1\n\nBandana x 1\n\nDelicates Bag for Dirty Clothes x 1 \n\nProtein Bars x 10\n\nLiquid IV x 10\n\nNOT PICTURED: \n\nMatador Foldable Mini Blanket x1\n\nMatador 2L Dry Bag x 1\n\nBody Sunscreen 3.3oz x1\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention\nI wanted to say how amazing having a Charles Schwab bank account has been.

Would highly recommend getting all three before traveling or even the more *elite* versions if you can afford it. My partner and I each have these so if anything ever goes wrong we have a Mastercard, visa, and separate bank accounts!",

You would probably only put things in there that you won't need very often. The side pocket in the Aer is more useful to me since it's still pretty discrete while still being pretty accessible.\n* It doesn't stand on its own very well; it tends to lean forward even when loaded with a laptop in the back\n* There's a tiny stain on one of the mesh pocket in the main compartment\n\nOverall, I am liking this bag.

        "selftext": "Recently got the GlobeRider 35 to replace my Aer Travel Pack 3 Small X-pac. I won't be posting a lot of photos since you can see them on their official website, but I will try to post some initial impressions on the bag and compare it to the Aer.\n\nPro\n\n* Bigger AND lighter than the smaller Aer Travel Pack 3 Small X-pac\n* With my typical load it's very comfortable. Not sure if it's the hip belt or simply because it's lighter, maybe both\n* I like the internal organization on the main compartment more than on the Aer\n* I like that the laptop compartment is inside the main compartment and not in its own compartment like the Aer. I think this maximizes carry volume better.\n* There's an opening below the laptop sleeve that you can reach inside to take out the back padding to perhaps make it even lighter.\n* It has an external water bottle pocket\n* Both the shoulder straps and the hip belt can be stowed, and the hip belt can be removed entirely\n* Most external pockets and compartments have their own volume that expands outward somewhat\n\nNeutral\n\n* The shoulder strap is maybe a little wide for my body type, and the padding is very hard and stiff. Maybe a little bit of break-in will help\n* I wish the admin panel is better. Aer has a better and more useable admin panel in my opinion\n* I haven't used a hip belt since maybe 20 years ago and I am not sure I would use it with this bag or not. I've carried a \\~40L Eagle Creek duffle/backpack for travel for many years and that one doesn't have hip belt nor a very good harness system, and it was \"fine.\"\n* The hip belt is quite difficult to remove because of the velcro\n* I wish they kept the grid fabric design from the 45L version, even if not in UHMWPE\n* The front mesh pocket is quite floppy and loose. Maybe I will add some cords to tie it down to keep things from moving or falling out\n\nCon\n\n* Some questionable stitching on the shoulder strap attachment points\n* Fabric isn't as nice as Ultra or X-pac\n* The secret pocket is quite difficult to use, but I guess that's the point. You would probably only put things in there that you won't need very often. The side pocket in the Aer is more useful to me since it's still pretty discrete while still being pretty accessible.\n* It doesn't stand on its own very well; it tends to lean forward even when loaded with a laptop in the back\n* There's a tiny stain on one of the mesh pocket in the main compartment\n\nOverall, I am liking this bag. I just wish the fabric is a little \"fancier\" and the black version isn't so \"understated.\"",

I had a [great onebag trip to Europe last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/x58kx9/europe_2_weeks_september_my_onebag_is_too_big/) but found myself thinking that my backpack was still too heavy and bulky, so this time I want to optimize for weight and size.\n\nSo, here is a first pass of packing my [Matador Freefly16 Packable Backpack](https://matadorup.com/products/freefly16-2) for 2 weeks in Tokyo and Kyoto!

This definitely allows me to  be able to pack less clothes.\n* During  my last trip to Japan during this same time of the year, the weather  was hot and rainy. I did not find myself needing a jacket other than a  rain jacket. The fact that it‚Äôll be ‚Äúsingle layer‚Äù weather allows me to  pack less clothes also.\n* I‚Äôm  going into this confidently knowing that I‚Äôll be able to buy anything  once I‚Äôm there, hence deliberately packing maybe a little less than I  need (one less t-shirt, no mid-weight jacket, less socks, etc).\n* Disclaimer:  I will probably also bring an empty packable duffel bag to bring back  souvenirs, so the trip back is not going to be a onebag trip.\n* A travel adapter is not needed because I‚Äôm traveling from the US and the plug is the same.\n* Physical e-sim and removal tool is not needed because I use e-sim cards.\n* Not pictured: Pilot G2 0.38 pen, plastic bag to use as dirty clothes bag, passport and some other docs/printouts, Apple AirTag.",

            "body": "The Beast28 is one of my favorites for sure, here are some comments for people who have been considering it or just interested. These thoughts pretty much all apply to the smaller Beast18 as well because the only difference between the Beast18 and the Beast28 is the size. Oh, and the Beast18's removable hip belt doesn't have stretchy pockets. (I bought this bag with my own money, btw).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The **flexible internal wire frame** is amazing and the Beast28's secret weapon for sure. Gives the bag some structure and somehow makes the bag attach to my back so even when I have to run with it, I can feel the backpack move along with my body. It's surprisingly one of the most comfortable bags I've used even though the shoulder straps and back panel are so thin. The thin mesh still makes the back panel breathable enough though. I'm not even sure how this bag can be so comfortable, it has to be a combination of the wire frame, the mesh and just the low weight of the bag itself.\n* Probably **the most versatile backpack I've had**. It's advertised as an ultralight technical hiking backpack and it has most features you find in hiking bags, such as daisy chains, gear loops for hiking poles, and it even comes with a REALLY nice and supportive removable hip belt. I'm sure I could even take this bag on an overnight camping trip if I can figure out how to attach the sleeping bag to the bottom of the pack. If you're not looking for lots of organization, it's also a very functional EDC bag and it can obviously be used for trips because it has enough space for packing cubes and toiletries. I know that in the bag community, we often get obsessed with the idea that there has to be a bag that can do it all, and sometimes that idea seems elusive, but this is the closest I've come to finding such a bag. The packability is a bonus for me and not something I necessarily I even need. I got a stuff sack with the bag that can hold the Beast28 when it's compressed, but it's worth noting that because of the wire frame, the Beast28 is a bit bulkier than other packable daypacks when packed. Same goes for the smaller Beast18 as far as I know. Although this is a hiking bag, it doesn't look out of place at the office or in the city because of its understated all-black design. I don't need a 28L bag necessarily for EDC so I've been thinking about getting the Beast18 as well.\n* Worth noting that even though Matador advertises the Beast28 as a mountaineering bag, I've seen comments that the material isn't robust enough to handle constant abrasion. The material is very water-resistant, I got the bottom of the bag really dirty one day and I just briefly submerged the bottom in a river that was nearby. No water got inside, but I've also seen comments that the inside will get wet if there is a long and heavy downpour.\n* The **bottle pockets are brilliant**. Deep and so stretchy that they can even hold my massive two-liter bottle that I occasionally carry.\n* No laptop sleeve inside, but you can fit a smaller 13'' laptop in the water bladder holder, which obviously isn't suspended or padded though. I just keep my laptop in a separate faux leather sleeve and just throw it in the main compartment.\n* I've seen some criticism about the **front compartment**, which goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, but I actually like it quite a bit. It's spacious enough to even hold a jacket and it has its own dedicated space, so if you need to get something from the bottom of the huge front pocket, at least your hand goes in there easily. There's also a smaller pocket at the top of the front compartment for accessories where I keep a Victorinox, a small first aid pack and a pen. There's also a small extra pocket in the bigger main compartment that also has a key loop.\n* Because this bag is made of really thin **210D Robic nylon**, it's still a bag that needs to be packed \"smartly\". If you have something pointy aimed at your back in the main compartment, you fill feel it against your back, and the bag just looks nicest when it's packed full. Being someone who has had many 500D Cordura bags, it sometimes feels like I'm handling a garbage bag when my Beast28 is half-full and I start opening it. I have to say that sometimes I really fumble to find the zipper pulls because they are black and blend in with the rest of the bag so much. The main compartment also has a really long J-shaped zipper that allows the backpack to open half-clamshell, which is a nice bonus. But I've thought about changing the zipper pulls to something more colorful so I can find them more quickly.\n* Oh man, if only this bag had a front mesh stash pocket... that would be the cherry on top.",

It wont have the same comfort as a hiking pack but it will be much better than like 99% of other packable bags.

Workmanship was generally alright but they seemed like they put more effort into the aesthetic and marketing than the actual design and durability of the products - dry bags without seam seals and with ultra thin materials compared to less expensive osprey ones I have (bigger ones), travel toiletry bottles with single piece plastic hinges that will snap through use, travel towels (with admittedly useful rubber carry pods) at a huge premium for a microfiber towel over other brands for no better quality or functionality.\n\nI'd recommend the Acteryx Deuter or Osprey if you want this style of pack, they make quality products and the materials are always solid.",

        "selftext": "Yes, backpacks in the picture are of different kinds/purposes, but these are the most illustrative pictures to my question that I managed to find. \n\nPicture on the left. That‚Äôs, from my understanding, the most comfortable way to wear a backpack: tight to the body and somewhat high, so the weight pushes on shoulders from the top rather than pulling them back. Ignore the hip belt for now.\n\nPicture in the middle. Same idea, but the pack is half the size of the previous one, so its top part is lower, while it sits still high. Keep ignoring the hip belt. \n\nPicture on the right. And that is how I see majority of backpacks pictured being worn, except for big backpacking ones. Pack sits lower, straps pull shoulders back, making pack lean away from body and sit even lower, which in turn pull shoulders even further back and so on.\n\nI don‚Äôt find the third pictured way of wearing backpack comfortable. At all. Unless it‚Äôs very light and I‚Äôm carrying for a short period of time, then it‚Äôs okay, not great, just okay. Carrying heavier or longer makes me want to pull backpack closer and tighter (I guess, that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm trying to make load push down on my shoulders and not pull back). To make it sit more comfortably, I end up pulling it so high, that shoulder straps start to rub against my neck and upper traps. Also, that makes straps move apart and kinda sit in armpits; to prevent that I tighten chest strap, which pulls straps closer, putting even more side pressure on the neck.\n\nBackpacks I‚Äôm currently dealing with (and looking to possible update because of the reason above) are REI Ruckpack 18L and 28L. Aer Travel Pack 2 has pretty much the same issue but aided a little by having a waist belt, though not a lot. \nI do lift and have broad shoulders but by no means a big guy at 180lbs and 6ft. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? And how do I fix it?",

            "author": "gabek333",
            "body": "I used to work at REI so let me give a rundown of how to properly wear a backpack.\n\nSo first off, hiking bags and travel bags are made differently. Hiking bags are designed to be worn for long stretches of time and while walking. Travel bags are more convenient for packing (clamshell open vs. top loading) but are not designed to be worn for as long because the assumption is that you will put your bag down on a plane/bus/etc.\n\nThe features reflect this. Every single hiking backpack has (or should have) load lifters. If you look at the middle and left pictures, it's the little adjuster strap between the top of the back and the shoulder strap. These straps pull the upper part of the bag closer to your upper back. Hiking bags also have burly hip belts to evenly distribute weight to the legs and take the stress off of your back and shoulders. The shape is also usually designed to hug your back and therefore is curved to match your spine.\n\nMost of these features would be great on travel bags, but they aren't super practical. The burly hip belt on backpacking bags flops around and cannot really but put away. The curve of the bag is definitely not conducive to carrying laptops. The top loading is challenging for organization on a trip in a city. Even load lifters add weight and dangling straps. Most travel bags have chest straps in lieu of the other features. The chest straps keep your bag from sliding out to your outer shoulders, helping your back. Maybe try loosening the chest strap to where it's comfortable?\n\nThe reality is, though, that most bags of any style under 30 liters don‚Äôt usually have the hiking features because they become a little unnecessary. If the bag is light, there's not much of a need to have the fit be absolutely perfect. I think at 18 liters, those features are excessive. But at 28? Maybe find a bag with those features? Ask yourself if you'd rather have a better carrying experience or organizational experience because you usually sacrifice one.\n\nThe [Osprey Porter 30](https://www.rei.com/product/171302/osprey-porter-30-travel-pack) has load lifters, but I'm not a huge fan of the bag. The [Cotopaxi Allpa 28](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-28l-travel-pack?variant=40467748519997) has those features as well, but reviews are mixed on the bag. Maybe go try it on?\n\nFor any hip belt, you ideally want the top of your hips to be in the middle of the hip belt. Everyone's hips are at different heights so find where yours are. They're usually higher than you expect (a bit higher than where most people wear pants), and usually around the belly button. With the hip belt in the right place, the shoulder strap should be flush with your shoulder (and not have space below). Actually, in the picture on the left, the strap/height of the bag should be adjusted a little bit haha.\n\nI think the first thing you should do is play with your chest strap to find a way where it doesn't cut into your neck. I've found that with my 30L Tom Bihn Aeronaut that I can wear the back for very long stretches (not quite as long as my hiking bags for when I backpack in the backcountry) and it's mostly because that bag rocks and the frame sheet/chest strap keep the bag structured and in place.\n\nIf the chest strap just doesn't work, you probably just need to find a bag with a real hip belt. Don't settle for webbing, that does absolutely nothing. You need a strap at least two fingers in width to transfer weight to your hips and ideally, you would have a rigid frame on the bag as well.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, hope this helped.",

                "body": "Thank you! This is an amazing reply that helps and clarifies a lot. \n\nMy question... rather my situation is I walk a decent amount (10 to 20km) almost daily. Either in the city or national parks; no wilderness and survival. My load is compact but dense, basically camera gear and water. Most of the time I carry light (\\~2.5kg) and it takes very little space (3-4L) plus water. And occasionally need to carry heavier but still under 30L volume for sure. I don't do anything extreme but go off beaten paths regularly. \n\nSo I want a backpack that I'll carry daily and that will be very comfortable :) And it seems to me more and more that I need a fully featured hiking style one. But carrying 4L load in a 30L or even 20L backpack looks questionable. \n\nWhat would be your advice?",

You can check out their website for how these bags are supposed to be work and its basically exactly like in the picture you shared [https://evergoods.us/products/panel-loader-classic-20l](https://evergoods.us/products/panel-loader-classic-20l)",

It usually looks like the pic on the right. I try and have the shoulders \"floating\" almost, with the straps to only really stabilize lateral movement.\n\n\nre:op: I'd refrain from pulling tighter, unless you're trying to stay hyper-mobile (running,scrambling, etc.). The logic \"tighter more secure\" might make sense, but in reality It will increase pressure fully on your shoulder muscles. Your body will compensate by leaning forward because of all the weight, &amp; now your whole posture is off balance and will hurt in the long run.\n\nGet the weight off your shoulders, onto your hips. Use the chest/sternum strap to \"float\" your pack off your shoulders. This may result in the top leaning back slightly, but again, you will naturally lean forward. The heavier the pack, the more it's about finding the balance of it all to get the most comfort.",
