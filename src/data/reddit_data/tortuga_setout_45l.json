Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99).

Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday.

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

        "selftext": "I’m planning on a RTW trip (from London to SE Asia / Australia by land and sea) next year, and am using a 3 week trip to Cuba in April as my practice run for Onebagging. \n\nI‘ve had my eye on the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L for a while but has been out of stock in the UK since I began searching. Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question! Updates to come…\n\nPictures attached.",

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut.

        "selftext": "I’m planning on a RTW trip (from London to SE Asia / Australia by land and sea) next year, and am using a 3 week trip to Cuba in April as my practice run for Onebagging. \n\nI‘ve had my eye on the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L for a while but has been out of stock in the UK since I began searching. Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question! Updates to come…\n\nPictures attached.",

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

With that said, it can hold A LOT of stuff and you can organize the way you want. It's quite nice using, pulling, packing in pouches and packing cubes. It's a comfortable up to a point though so you don't want to pack extremely heavy. It's clean to look at and works well with one bag travel. I've taken mine to a month long west coast trip from Vancouver to LA.\n\nAlso, I'm willing to sell mine if interested. Used but very well taken care of.",

I agree that you might want to consider weight for your pack, and from the looks of it, one of the best ones for your requirement would actually be the [Minaal 3.0](https://www.minaal.com/collections/3-0-series/products/carry-on-bag-upgrade). Its at an amazing pre-order price and I recommend you jump on it.\n\nBesides that, the [Arcido Akra 35L](https://www.arcido.com/collections/backpacks/products/akra) is a good budget option. I have seen that come down to $150 regularly so you can snag a good deal on it.\n\nI personally have the Peak Design Travel pack myself. I do love it. But I just replaced it with a [Cotopaxi Allpa 42L](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-42l-travel-pack-sale?variant=32054530998333). I found the Cotopaxi Allpa suits my travel style a bit better. They have an [Allpa 35L](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-35l-travel-pack-sale-1?variant=32054512582717) and an Allpa 28L as well. My wife has the 35L and surprisingly, I can fit a tonne of stuff in there (as much as the Peak Design Travel in 45L mode!!). I would recommend the Cotopaxi, but they are quite heavy themselves. So probably not a good idea for traveling around Asia.\n\nIf it were me, i would get something like the Minaal3.0 and accompany it with something like the Peak Design Sling 6L or a packable backpack ([something like this](https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/82300168/stowaway-packable-20l-daypack?sp=1&amp;color=Amethyst&amp;size=ONE%20SIZE))",

Here is an alternative seller who sell the same bag for around the same price [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33061571035.html](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/33061571035.html)\n\n## Usage\n\nFor context, I am a location independent web developer (digital nomad is the trendy term), that's mean I work in co-working places, libraries, and café during my trips.\n\nI'm not entirely nomad, I have a house in France. I just travel a lot.\n\nI haven't used this backpack a lot yet (3/4 times) because I prefer to use [my smaller Naturehike backpack](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/f46k8m/naturehike_laptop_backpack_review_mystery_ranch/) for short trips and I don't actually travel for more than 3-4 days but my first impressions are very good!\n\n## The bag\n\nIt's a 30 L scalable backpack : 44 x 29 x 14(24)cm. It's expandable from around 18L to around 31L.\n\nThe style is simple and \"business-ish\".\n\nAs you should have guessed from the low price, the fabric of the backpack is oxford polyester with a water repellent treatment.\n\nAs it's usually the case in most of the Chinese backpacks, there is an external USB port (useless in my case).\n\nThe backpack is a bit similar to the AER Travel pack (front pocket with organization, main clamshell pocket and laptop compartment on the back) with a Minaal carry-on touch (less bulky and fluffier). I haven't owned a Tortuga Setout divide but I think this Tortuga bag is the same idea than the one I've bought.\n\nYou can use the backpack as a classic backpack or as a hand luggage thanks to the 2 side handles.\n\nI previously owned an AER Travel pack and the Ozuko small knockoff of this bag but the problem with these bags is they are too heavy (1.8 kg for the classic version and 1.5 kg for the small version). Contrary to AER Travel Pack and its knockoffs I have owned, this bag is lightweight (only 1kg).\n\nThe bag is available in 2 colors: black or gray.\n\n## Backpack organization\n\nThe bag has 2 small pockets on the front: one horizontally and one vertically.\n\nThe front pocket is the \"office pocket\" with the organization inside. Note that the pockets inside are very thin and don't seem to be robust. The front pocket is the pocket I use when I use this backpack as a daypack to go to cafés, libraries, coworking...\n\nThen there is the main pocket (\"the clothing pocket\") that opens like a clamshell. That is the expandable pocket. When the bag is not expanded, this pocket is very thin and can't really be used. But that's not a problem because the other pockets are accessible when the bag is retracted.\n\nOn the back of the bag, there is the laptop compartment that can carry a 15,6\" laptop and a tablet (or in my case, my 12,5\" external monitor).\n\nThere is a sternum strap on the straps of the backpack.\n\nThere is a fixing belt for luggage on the back of the backpack. Because we are all one bagging here, you should think it's useless. But it can be used to remove the straps and fix them to carry the bag as a business bag.\n\nThe bag I received is a bit different than the bag shown on the Aliexpress website. The front pockets are perpendicular and the backpack has no brand.\n\nHere are my real pictures of the backpack to have a closer look on the backpack: https://imgur.com/a/UkNZn2F\n\n## Cons\n\nThis bag hasn't water pockets. That's why I use a [memo bottle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33027527390.html) or a [Vapur water bottle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32970675316.html) I put inside the front pocket. Of course, the quality is quite good but not as solid as my previous AER Travel Pack for example.\n\n## To conclude\n\nThis generic backpack is very good. It's not a knockoff but its organization is similar to the AER Travel Pack. The style is more business than urban because it can be used as hand luggage too. It's also expandable.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nIf you like this style of bag, here are some interesting alternatives I've found on the AliExpress website. The quality seems better than the bag I own, but prices are higher and these bags are heavier.\n\n- [Ozuko](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000275775935.html) : $50 / 32x17x48cm / 1.2kg. It looks like an enhanced version of my backpack. My knockoff of the AER Travel Pack was from this brand. I haven't bought it but I recommend you to check this backpack instead of the one I own.\n- [Artic Hunter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000143644627.html) : $45 / 30x15x43 cm / 1.5kg\n\nThere are many reviews of expansive backpacks on this subreddit. But if you can't/don't want/whatever use a lot of money for a backpack, there are more and more possibilities for you to use a good travel backpack and have a nice trip :)",
