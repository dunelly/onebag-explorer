            "body": "Before I start my rant, I wanna say that I'm a fanboy of peak design. I own several PD products, I love the company philosophy and design DNA and wanted to like this bag a lot. But, two things are making me think about returning this bag or already thinking of ways to modify it. I was planning to put my Camera Cube M and Sling 6L inside, and both fit in perfectly with room to spare and also put the travel duffel on top of my Rimowa Salsa Cabin luggage. I like to research a lot and go thru as many reviews as I can before buying stuff, but I don’t remember any other reviewer discussing the cons that I would like to talk about. (The pros are plenty and what the reviews say they are.)\n\nFirst of all, the handles are *atrocious*, I saw a bunch of reviews talking about how the magnets in the top handles are not strong enough, but they say it's a small gripe weighing against the pros of the bag. Never mind the magnets, I’m not talking about the magnets, the handles themselves are the most uncomfortable handles that I've ever used in my whole life, the rigidness makes it so uncomfortable and as soon as I pick it up I can feel like the handles are trying to pull apart from my hand. I hate picking this thing up already. The handles lay flat in your hand parallel to the floor, which makes it feel like you are holding two rulers in your hand rather than a handle. I understand they probably chose this design so that the consumer can double this bag as a backpack, but I just cannot understand how PD design team could pick this bag up and say this is acceptable. It’s a duffel bag and in my opinion, this should have been maybe the second thing they should have priority on perfecting this bag. They could have just used cheap canvas straps and it would probably be more comfortable than the current ones. My opinion is they just tried to kill two birds with one stone and it came out mediocre at best on both ends.\n\nMy second gripe is I was planning to use this bag as my primary bag for travel with my Rimowa Salsa Cabin, and wish they would have provided one more handle next to the main zipper so I can use it properly as pass-through on the handle to slide on my luggage. PD lists this on their website \"Hand straps double as luggage pass-through for roller bag carry\" I hope that they meant the handles on the bottom of the bag and not the main handles on the top of the bag, because if you use the main handles they are too way loose and just droop to the front if you are not extra careful making the luggage to tip over. The ones on the bottom have two small a loop in my case if that was what they were trying to say. Mine fits in barely, I have to wriggle it in really hard, and taking it out is even more ridiculous, it's like I'm a 34-size waist trying to fit into 31-size skinny jeans, I'm already having nightmares about trying to check in my luggage at the counter and just sweating all over trying to get my duffel bag off the damn luggage handle. I tried using my Sling 6L and that thing passes through perfectly fine. So, why didn't they make the handle loop the same distance as the Sling 6L? Or perhaps they did make it the same clearance, but because of placement and size of the bag the Sling 6L fits okay and the Travel Duffel 35L is struggling. If it is the same clearance, I hope PD makes the bottom loop clearances to be slightly bigger on the duffel in the future. What I would have liked also is that they had another strap on top of the bag next to the main zipper, which makes it possible to sit on top of the luggage sideways as well or maybe on the sides, or the bottom. I understand that they wanted the bag to be flush when on a flat surface so, maybe a strap on the bottom is not an option.\n\nI hope I don’t come off as abrasive in my critique, I’m not sure if this forum is moderated by PD or by normal Redditors, but I want to tell you guys I love PD products and hold them highly as a company. I wanted to love this bag to bits and pieces and be good. I expect nothing less from PD. I hope PD hits a home run outta the park with the next version, or provide alternative/upgraded top handles that are way more ergonomic.",

            "body": "Before I start my rant, I wanna say that I'm a fanboy of peak design. I own several PD products, I love the company philosophy and design DNA and wanted to like this bag a lot. But, two things are making me think about returning this bag or already thinking of ways to modify it. I was planning to put my Camera Cube M and Sling 6L inside, and both fit in perfectly with room to spare and also put the travel duffel on top of my Rimowa Salsa Cabin luggage. I like to research a lot and go thru as many reviews as I can before buying stuff, but I don’t remember any other reviewer discussing the cons that I would like to talk about. (The pros are plenty and what the reviews say they are.)\n\nFirst of all, the handles are *atrocious*, I saw a bunch of reviews talking about how the magnets in the top handles are not strong enough, but they say it's a small gripe weighing against the pros of the bag. Never mind the magnets, I’m not talking about the magnets, the handles themselves are the most uncomfortable handles that I've ever used in my whole life, the rigidness makes it so uncomfortable and as soon as I pick it up I can feel like the handles are trying to pull apart from my hand. I hate picking this thing up already. The handles lay flat in your hand parallel to the floor, which makes it feel like you are holding two rulers in your hand rather than a handle. I understand they probably chose this design so that the consumer can double this bag as a backpack, but I just cannot understand how PD design team could pick this bag up and say this is acceptable. It’s a duffel bag and in my opinion, this should have been maybe the second thing they should have priority on perfecting this bag. They could have just used cheap canvas straps and it would probably be more comfortable than the current ones. My opinion is they just tried to kill two birds with one stone and it came out mediocre at best on both ends.\n\nMy second gripe is I was planning to use this bag as my primary bag for travel with my Rimowa Salsa Cabin, and wish they would have provided one more handle next to the main zipper so I can use it properly as pass-through on the handle to slide on my luggage. PD lists this on their website \"Hand straps double as luggage pass-through for roller bag carry\" I hope that they meant the handles on the bottom of the bag and not the main handles on the top of the bag, because if you use the main handles they are too way loose and just droop to the front if you are not extra careful making the luggage to tip over. The ones on the bottom have two small a loop in my case if that was what they were trying to say. Mine fits in barely, I have to wriggle it in really hard, and taking it out is even more ridiculous, it's like I'm a 34-size waist trying to fit into 31-size skinny jeans, I'm already having nightmares about trying to check in my luggage at the counter and just sweating all over trying to get my duffel bag off the damn luggage handle. I tried using my Sling 6L and that thing passes through perfectly fine. So, why didn't they make the handle loop the same distance as the Sling 6L? Or perhaps they did make it the same clearance, but because of placement and size of the bag the Sling 6L fits okay and the Travel Duffel 35L is struggling. If it is the same clearance, I hope PD makes the bottom loop clearances to be slightly bigger on the duffel in the future. What I would have liked also is that they had another strap on top of the bag next to the main zipper, which makes it possible to sit on top of the luggage sideways as well or maybe on the sides, or the bottom. I understand that they wanted the bag to be flush when on a flat surface so, maybe a strap on the bottom is not an option.\n\nI hope I don’t come off as abrasive in my critique, I’m not sure if this forum is moderated by PD or by normal Redditors, but I want to tell you guys I love PD products and hold them highly as a company. I wanted to love this bag to bits and pieces and be good. I expect nothing less from PD. I hope PD hits a home run outta the park with the next version, or provide alternative/upgraded top handles that are way more ergonomic.",

            "body": "Before I start my rant, I wanna say that I'm a fanboy of peak design. I own several PD products, I love the company philosophy and design DNA and wanted to like this bag a lot. But, two things are making me think about returning this bag or already thinking of ways to modify it. I was planning to put my Camera Cube M and Sling 6L inside, and both fit in perfectly with room to spare and also put the travel duffel on top of my Rimowa Salsa Cabin luggage. I like to research a lot and go thru as many reviews as I can before buying stuff, but I don’t remember any other reviewer discussing the cons that I would like to talk about. (The pros are plenty and what the reviews say they are.)\n\nFirst of all, the handles are *atrocious*, I saw a bunch of reviews talking about how the magnets in the top handles are not strong enough, but they say it's a small gripe weighing against the pros of the bag. Never mind the magnets, I’m not talking about the magnets, the handles themselves are the most uncomfortable handles that I've ever used in my whole life, the rigidness makes it so uncomfortable and as soon as I pick it up I can feel like the handles are trying to pull apart from my hand. I hate picking this thing up already. The handles lay flat in your hand parallel to the floor, which makes it feel like you are holding two rulers in your hand rather than a handle. I understand they probably chose this design so that the consumer can double this bag as a backpack, but I just cannot understand how PD design team could pick this bag up and say this is acceptable. It’s a duffel bag and in my opinion, this should have been maybe the second thing they should have priority on perfecting this bag. They could have just used cheap canvas straps and it would probably be more comfortable than the current ones. My opinion is they just tried to kill two birds with one stone and it came out mediocre at best on both ends.\n\nMy second gripe is I was planning to use this bag as my primary bag for travel with my Rimowa Salsa Cabin, and wish they would have provided one more handle next to the main zipper so I can use it properly as pass-through on the handle to slide on my luggage. PD lists this on their website \"Hand straps double as luggage pass-through for roller bag carry\" I hope that they meant the handles on the bottom of the bag and not the main handles on the top of the bag, because if you use the main handles they are too way loose and just droop to the front if you are not extra careful making the luggage to tip over. The ones on the bottom have two small a loop in my case if that was what they were trying to say. Mine fits in barely, I have to wriggle it in really hard, and taking it out is even more ridiculous, it's like I'm a 34-size waist trying to fit into 31-size skinny jeans, I'm already having nightmares about trying to check in my luggage at the counter and just sweating all over trying to get my duffel bag off the damn luggage handle. I tried using my Sling 6L and that thing passes through perfectly fine. So, why didn't they make the handle loop the same distance as the Sling 6L? Or perhaps they did make it the same clearance, but because of placement and size of the bag the Sling 6L fits okay and the Travel Duffel 35L is struggling. If it is the same clearance, I hope PD makes the bottom loop clearances to be slightly bigger on the duffel in the future. What I would have liked also is that they had another strap on top of the bag next to the main zipper, which makes it possible to sit on top of the luggage sideways as well or maybe on the sides, or the bottom. I understand that they wanted the bag to be flush when on a flat surface so, maybe a strap on the bottom is not an option.\n\nI hope I don’t come off as abrasive in my critique, I’m not sure if this forum is moderated by PD or by normal Redditors, but I want to tell you guys I love PD products and hold them highly as a company. I wanted to love this bag to bits and pieces and be good. I expect nothing less from PD. I hope PD hits a home run outta the park with the next version, or provide alternative/upgraded top handles that are way more ergonomic.",

        "selftext": "The Peak Design 35 litre Travel Duffel is a masterpiece. Brilliant engineering.\n\nI felt the 45 litre Travel Backpack was a letdown due to the poor straps - but this bag is great.\n\nI also love the 18 litre Totepack (and think the Everyday Backpacks look too clunky)  - so I seem to have a thing for Peak’s less popular bags.\n\nI’ll travel with the Totepack on my back and the Duffel over my shoulders - with a Samsonite suitcase in one hand for bigger trips.\n\nAs you can see the Everyday Sling 6 litre fits in perfectly as a pouch for my camera and DJI Mini 2 drone. Great.\n\nBut which Packing Cubes should I get for my clothes - and how many?\n\nIt looks like the Packing Cubes divide this bag into thirds - whereas the 6 litre Everyday Sling divides it in half.\n\nAlso, how many layers of pouches can/should you add?\n\nThanks",

Better materials, bigger sturdier zipper ( a must) and still made of recycled material.  They are much easier to pack tight and compress and I don’t worry about breaking the zippers.   I liked the one I got so much I ended up getting 3 more within 2 months.  I also like white color which makes them easier to spot and harder to leave behind.  While the Patagonia ones have really sturdy material too, the zippers are a size too small and they don’t compress.  Good luck with your hunt.  That 45L bag was the biggest disappointment I’ve ever bought.  The size was either too big or too small it seemed.  You have me intrigued by the duffle, it looks really nice.",

            "body": "I’m intrigued by this bag, honestly. The look leaves a little bit to be desired, but the functionality is what’s piqued my interest. My use case would be car travel and business travel by air. For business travel, I have to take a pair or two of dress shoes that I’ve put a lot of time and energy into shining properly and I refuse to check those so I always end up traveling with backpack, duffel, and carry-on suitcase that I check. Clothes in the carry-on, shoes in the duffel, work tech in the backpack. \n\nI have the Peak Design travel duffel 35L, and hate it. The carry handles are horrendous; the magnets don’t work at all, either to snap the carry handles together or to snap the bag’s sides down as advertised; and the bag itself has no real structure and sags down in the middle at the bottom like every other trash duffel I’ve had. The exterior pockets are fine, but not revolutionary. The only thing it does well is look really good. \n\nI’m not as triggered to immediately buy the EG TD35 as I’ve been to buy their CPLs, CTB26, and CAPs, but I’m leaning towards giving it the ol’ college try. I think with packing cubes, it’ll load beautifully and do exactly what I need it to do, but do it better than any other duffel I’ve tried. \n\nI do wish they’d given us the option to either load a laptop or use that panel as a luggage pass-through. A simple extra panel of 840D fabric on that exterior side would’ve given us the choice.",

I often want to reach-in to grab my keys, a quick a case, my phone or laptop while i am walking to my office… this just doesn’t seem like it’ll accommodate that.\n\n2. This seems really badly designed for what breifcases are intended to do… hold papers… I know, papers are so old school, but in a professional setting, we often rely on papers (because we need to provide materials to other professionals or because we have case files, for example). My current briefcase makes storing and grabbing papers on the outside super simple without them getting crumpled-up. I don’t see this accomplishing that.\n\n3. This looks WAY too casual for any professional workspace. I can’t imagine wearing this with a suit. Canvas is a great, casual material that goes well with a suitcase, this just seems like an old boxy laptop bag by Lenovo or something. If you are in tech, maybe that’s fine. But it might not fit for many professional environments.\n\n4. The zippers don’t zip down the sides fully or at least to a gusset? That’s very important for easy access and pulling out papers without them getting crumpled.\n\n5. Water bottle holder INSIDE the briefcase? First… if you need a briefcase for work, you probably work at an office, you have your own water sources. 2nd… briefcases are for holding briefs. Hello… no one is risking putting a water bottle in there. The umbrella is a cute idea as well, but a better option would have been an exterior strap.\n\nI’ve got a few other beefs with the design. But I’ll wait for more footage before i make a final decision.",

(which I absolutely LOVE). My tech and gear will stay in the Daypack. Shoes + clothes + CPAP machine will live in the duffel. I've narrowed down my choices to the following 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; trying to match with my Aer Daypack 2 which is why I'm trying to stick to Aer products, but it's not an absolute must. Shoe compartments are a plus, laptop compartments a plus. Would love it if anyone has real-world experiences with either bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) [Aer Gym Duffel 3](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-3-black) **$169** \\---- 24.1L (17\" x 11.5\" x 9\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9l2y1vj6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc79be145ebf631f8a1bb2acca6801bca4e1076d\n\nThis one seems like the newest out of the families of Aer duffels, but also the smallest coming in at 24L. The shoe compartment is a big seller for me since I love that feature and prevents me from buying a shoe bag. I also like to keep my dirty clothes in there after the trip.\n\n* *Pros*: Matches with backpack, newer materials and improvements from the Duffel 2 (i think?), shoe compartment, brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons: S*maller than the others, more expensive. only one review on youtube from RushFaster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) [Aer Gym Duffel 2](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-2-black) **$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhlbprkk6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4f99188cdcb3986828a7d4f180d9c5356b2122\n\n**$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nI believe this is the version before the Gym Duffel 3, but some reason the size is way bigger.\n\n* *Pros:* shoe compartment, larger in size,brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons:* older? maybe doesnt have some improvements in materials like the newer Duffel 3? Also another con is the zipper down the center, seems awkward. couldnt find any reviews online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.)  [Aer Travel Duffel](https://www.aersf.com/travel-duffel-black) **$170** \\---- **35L** (21.3\" x 12.6\" x 9.1\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewyvwm7l6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e05290a837652c94f80846ff83269b68f0a6406\n\nThis is the one specifically for traveling with a huge bucket-style opening to dump clothes in. Although this one is considered the \"travel\" one, it don't like that it doesn't have the shoe compartment at least.\n\n* Pros: big bucket-style opening, nice handle, compression straps, brand uniformity with aer\n* Cons: no shoe compartment, the center-placed handle doesn't seem like it might handle a lot of weight if carried briefcase-style. few reviews online but everyone says it's decent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[removed peak design 35L since feedback has been so-so\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love and appreciate your input!",

For travel, I think you want a more put-together look.\n\nRegarding the built-in shoe compartment: having a separate bag for your shoes is functionally the same (keeps the dirt off your clothes), looks cleaner (fewer external zippers), and is more versatile because you can leave it at home if you don't need an extra pair of shoes for your trip.\n\nThere are tons of high-quality, lightweight options for shoe bags too.

The magnets are a novel concept, but IRL they aren't strong enough to hold the handles together except under ideal circumstances. As a result, you've now got two magnetic strips as handles - they're narrow and not at all comfortable to carry through an airport or something. I eventually took mine off, and only use the shoulder strap (which is awesome) or the grab handles on the ends to carry it vertically. I guess you could also get something to wrap the carry handles (like a [Mr. Gripper](https://defybags.com/collections/accessories-1/products/mr-gripper-horween-cavalier-whiskey-leather), for example) and that would also solve that issue.\n\nEverything else I've enjoyed, these are good bags for the money.
