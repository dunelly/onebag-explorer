            "body": "**A little bit more context**\n\n*UPDATE:* [Lighterpack add, a few optimizations](https://lighterpack.com/r/a6qb5i)\n\n8.6kg pack weight. Airline I'm flying has a 10kg limit. I know where I could shave around 30ounces if I needed too.\n\n---\n\n* Three climates will be; Taipei (Northern Taiwan) High 40s F in the mountains at night-70s F in Taipei city in the sun, Central and Southern Taiwan High 60-70s F with sun mostly, Tokyo 40s F and cold. Having been to Taiwan many times in the winter it can be quite cold and wet. Homes rarely have heat and when it's wet and cold it's bone chilling. The only strategy I have ever developed to battle this is MANY layers of merino and insulation.\n\n* I'm bringing two \"hard\" shells (the Nau trench and Patagonia Houdini) for water resistance and two insulation pieces (Patagonia Nano-puff Hoodie and Patagonia Nano-Air vest). That gives me a vast mix of outerwear options for any climate I'll be in. I can even layer them together if needed (for very cold). These are my standard home (NYC) winter outerwear options minus a heavy winter parka (which I won't need on this trip) and a proper heavy rain/snow shell. I'm a big fan of the Patagonia Houdini system. It's ultra lightweight and windproof, breathable and decent water resistance for it's weight (I'd never bring a Houdini shell as a primary shell unless traveling to a tropical area in summer where I need some moderate rain resistance).\n\n* I love technical pieces that can be layered. **Outlier** is my go too for most things and a swear by their merino t-shirts and socks. **Patagonia** is my go-to for any outdoor needs. **Nau** is a brand I like for a more urban technical look. **Aether** is one I love for their cotton items (it's a very heavy slub twill weave). After searching for a good pair of merino underwear (I'm not a fan of Icebreaker) I've been giving **Wool &amp; Prince** a shot for the past few weeks, so far so good, enough that I added one of their merino t-shirts. I try not to buy much from Uniqlo anymore (fast fashion and all) but I love their Airism and Heattech lines, a lot of value for the money with them. \n\n* 95% of my wardrobe is black (other colors I wear are blues and grey). Black is versitile, doesn't stain, is neutral and works for most places I go professionally and casually. This trip is a vacation with some family related stuff so I won't need anything dressy. That being said I may bring a basic black sport coat/blazer (not pictured) just incase. That really depends on what my wife tells me are family plans needing a to look slightly more put-together (I am a 42 year old man, sometimes a jacket is needed). But I'm a designer in NYC, I can usually get away with all black basics, like I this pack, with little issue for all my needs.\n\n* Merino for-the-win. I've been wearing merino almost exclusively as a base layer for almost 3.5 years now. Outlier, hands-down, makes my favorite merino. Outlier's Ultrafine fabrics, in their Ultrafine t-shirts is the best, warm in the winter and cool in the summer, quick drying and resist stink well with a great hefty weight and super soft feel. My one issue with them is they do stretch and are cut long to begin with. Enter the new Outlier Runweught T-shirt, it has nylon added to the weave which makes it snap back to shape after a hand wash better, plus they are lighter and work well on warmer days or as a running t-shirt. I have 3+ years of travel with Outlier Ultrafine merino and only one trip with the unweight merino, this will be a good test. I'm new to Wool &amp; Prince products and have been impressed with their underwear, enough that I am trying one of their merino t-shirts on this trip. Lastly, usually I bring Patagonia merino as a true base layer but am leaving the t-shirt at home this time and replacing with Uniqlo's heat tech short and long sleeve shirts. Heattech is significantly warmer to me and I'll generally use their pieces for sleeping where they are extra cozy (Taipei nights in Jan are COOOOOLLLLDDD and wet). I've not had any good experiences with Icebreaker items, and I've tried a few over the years. My go-to athletic/sport baselayers are Patagonia's lightweight merino (120 weight I think) or Rapha's merino layers (I'm a cyclist). But I'm impressed with Outlier's Runweight merino weight and weave that for all but cycling I might be able to replace them for other merino Ts.\n\n* Do I need 5 short-sleeve and 3 long-sleeve T-shirts? No, I could drop one of each easily. I'm bringing the extra of each just to always have one thats clean and extra layer in a pinch. Packing for extra comfort.\n\n* My Outlier Slim Dungarees are my go-to pant for most things. However I do like denim still. I used to swear by Levis 511s but recently decided to try a pair of Jean Shop (a NYC denim shop) Jims which is the cut they make very close to 511s. I've lived in these jeans for a few weeks now and appreciate their slightly trimmer cut and slightly heavier weight denim. Between a good pair of denim jeans and the SDs I have all my pant needs covered. I traditionally have travelled with a pair of Outlier Climbers, mostly as my on-the-plane pant (Climbers are a close as guys can get to the comfort women prefer yoga pants for). I'll be changing into my Houdini pants once we take off on this trip and am curious how comfortable I'll me. Ability to move around in the plane seat and have ample flexibility is key, Climbers tick those boxes but the Houdini should be better. \n\n* I usually travel with a pair of Outlier New Way shorts and Patagonia Baggies. Given the season and the only real places I'll need shorts are at the hotel gym/pool or running I'm only bringing the Baggies. Patagonia Houdini wind pants complete my pant needs and will be used on the plane and for a layering piece lounging at home or on an early morning run. In warmer climates or summer travel I'll swap the denim jeans for the Outlier New Way shorts, my Outlier SDs are always with me year round.\n\n* Stan Smith shoes will be the primary shoe here. I prefer white ones but went with black as they will be more versatile here (and hey, can't you tell I like black). The Bedrock Syncline Sandals are brand new. My beloved Luna Venados finally died in the fall. I like huarache style sandals for running (I'm a barefoot runner), hiking and any wet need a flip-flop might be needed in.\n\n* I never travel with a laptop unless it's business travel that I can't get away with an iPad and my iPhone. In this case since this trip is non-business I will only be bringing my iPhone 7 Plus for all web, music, reading, games, movies, communications and camera. I'm a Tmobile One Plus subscriber which gets me global 3G (speeds from 2G to 4G depending on the country) data. My phone is unlocked and if I need anything more serious I buy a local SIM, but it's been a while since I've needed that. WiFi is in most cafes and public areas and in Japan the AirBnB I'll be staying at offers an included jetpack for local wifi. I wear an Apple Watch daily (I;ve had both models) and use it mostly as a watch and a backup for Strava data. I've been loving my Apple AirPods and have yet to have an issue with battery one them but just incase I have a standard audio-jack pair with the lighting adaptor which will give me all possible audio needs. The Anker A7 power brick is new and rather large (it places a Incase 5400) but it does charge my phone 6-7 times on one charge so it's less I need to worry about. The little Incase 2500 power block is good for throwing in a jacket pocket and going with one extra charge from 30%.\n\n* I'll have access to laundry, a washing machine, for most of my trip. When I don't have access to a washing machine I'll be in a hotel, which will have laundry service. That being said I still prefer doing the small stuff, underwear/socks/t-shirts, every few days by hand. Thus the laundry kit. Plus in Asia, drying machines are rare, so hanging clothes to dry is a must. The braided silicon clothesline is wonderful as it doesn't need extra clothes pins and can hold the weight of a wet pair of jeans and a few t-shirts.",

She needs more than 25l sometimes though (extra pair of shoes and more layers during winter),  so something expandable like this may be just what she is looking for.  Originally she was looking at the Cotopaxi Allpa 28l, but this ARC seems to combine a similar opening style with both expansion and more dedicated organization.  Kind of a best of both worlds.

In 2024 Frontier have become more strict and usually on one out of 2 flights, gate agents stand at the ready to have you place your bag in the personal item sizer, if you can squeeze it in then fine, if not you have to pay. Do not chance it, Order a $15 made to size 14x8x18 bag on Amazon and ditch the back pack.",
