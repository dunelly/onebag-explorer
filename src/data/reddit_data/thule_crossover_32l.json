        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

Not sure if that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to fit but I don‚Äôt know if I like that. \n- the coating on the front of the bag seems like it could peel or scratch out down the line, as I‚Äôve seen posted a few times. \n- no (quality) water bottle holder?? \n- the zippers are a pain, especially around the corners and in the top right.

I really liked it, it feels *super* sturdy and well-built, and a good size for my 5‚Äô7‚Äù frame. I used it both as a carryon and checked bag. It held up great, and I can confirm that the wax finish, water bottle holder, spacious interior, zippers, etc. are all wins.\n\nMy only cons:  \n- The back laptop sleeve is more robust than I prefer, as someone who rarely brings a laptop. I‚Äôd prefer it to be lighter and thinner / more unobtrusive when not in use.  \n- On a similar note, the plastic divider is pretty bulky if packed down into its stow compartment. I wish it fully unzipped so I could leave it at home.   \n- If I had the larger size, I‚Äôd be tempted to spring for the hip belt. The bag is very comfy to wear, but when fully loaded, even the smaller size was testing my patience a bit on the journey home. Walking was fine, standing around in customs lines was a bummer.\n\nBut I snagged mine for $90 with tags from the returns section of REI, so‚Ä¶ I really can‚Äôt complain!",

The Thule is going to put 100% of the weight on your shoulders. \n\n\nYou might also try the new REI Trail 40 women‚Äôs version that comes in three sizes.

I really liked it, it feels *super* sturdy and well-built, and a good size for my 5‚Äô7‚Äù frame. I used it both as a carryon and checked bag. It held up great, and I can confirm that the wax finish, water bottle holder, spacious interior, zippers, etc. are all wins.\n\nMy only cons:  \n- The back laptop sleeve is more robust than I prefer, as someone who rarely brings a laptop. I‚Äôd prefer it to be lighter and thinner / more unobtrusive when not in use.  \n- On a similar note, the plastic divider is pretty bulky if packed down into its stow compartment. I wish it fully unzipped so I could leave it at home.   \n- If I had the larger size, I‚Äôd be tempted to spring for the hip belt. The bag is very comfy to wear, but when fully loaded, even the smaller size was testing my patience a bit on the journey home. Walking was fine, standing around in customs lines was a bummer.\n\nBut I snagged mine for $90 with tags from the returns section of REI, so‚Ä¶ I really can‚Äôt complain!",

Not something that you take for a hike, of course. The weight will be all in your shoulder, but the straps are well padded. \n\nI think it can be a good consideration for people doing lots of business trips.",

I like this sort of organization as it pretty much allows you not to have to use packing cubes. But the alternatives do not work for me. The Wandrd I found a bit uncomfortable, plus too many zippers and small useless compartments that interfere with each other, and the Allpa is too unstructured while still being heavy.   \nThe question mark here is always the harness system. It might not be enough if I am caught in a situation of 2/3 hours carrying the bag.   \nThe non-removable hip belt is a bummer on those alternatives.",

Also has 2 little mesh pockets up top. These are great and i wish the entire panel was covered in them- may have to make some alterations.\n\nFront Pocket; 2 pen sleeves 2 notepad sleeves, one zipped mesh pouch and 1 zipped opaque pouch. Well organised, sufficient space for things like medications, wallet, pens, shears, ect.\n\nFront Stuff Sleeve; good for high use items, for me its my steth and splash goggles, but can be good for winter gloves, beanies, or a packable raincoat.\n\nSide Bottle Sleeves; pretty short actually and could be deeper.\n\nTop Sunglasses Pouch; reinforced and easily accessible. Fits large sunnies easily and you know you won‚Äôt break them.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGreat large-sized backpack that can be used for commuting, or travel thanks to the large pocket suitable to keep a couple of changes of clothes. Suspended laptop pocket works well and the front stuff pocket is very useful, and the sunnies pouch is well positioned and accesible.\n\nCons would be small water bottle side pouches, lack of extra mesh pockets for organising, and generally its heavy ish for a backpack, so for those looking for lightweight it may not fit the bill.",

I use mine primarily for rockhounding, ie, dogging up cool rocks and bringing them home.  So I‚Äôm carrying a couple rock picks, a 3-4lb sledgehammer, plus water, snacks, assorted small tools, and hopefully at the end of the day some really cool rocks.  The Stir 20 carries it all with ease, 20-25 lbs surprisingly comfortable.  I‚Äôve been using it heavily for almost 3 years, and have washed it once, it still looks almost brand new.  \n\nThe only downside is that it‚Äôs a little narrow, so when it‚Äôs fully packed it‚Äôs a little hard to access stuff at the bottom, so it would be nice to have a side or bottom zipper.  The Stir 35 does have a side zipper, plus a removable hip belt and more adjustable shoulder harness.  If I needed another 35L backpack, I‚Äôd absolutely buy a Stir 35.",

They hold their form.)\n\nHere they are packed with pretty loosely put together stuff. I couldn't fit everything in the CP, since the CPP is obviously bigger.\n\nSome things to note: the inner pockets in the CP are useless when fully packed. Yes, quite a bit fits in the 14L pack, but it is \\*uncomfortable\\* to take stuff out. The clamshell zip is a game-changer.\n\nAnother thing: I didn't include a laptop.

        "selftext": "Really happy with it so far. Needed something between my camel back backpack and Everki Atlas 32L for every day use. $179aud.\n\nAim was to have something where I can take small keyboard, mouse etc to clients that wasn't too bulky and that I could use on weekends/trips around when I didn't need to take my 4kg 17\" Thinkpad P72 Workstation.\nAnd hold up to being thrown around and used for like 10 years like my old Targus before I got the Everki.\n\nMain pocket is straightforward. Fits my hard shell laptop case in the laptop pocket so probably would fit a 16\" laptop.\n\nThe document pocket (or for tablets?) can't fit my A4 notes binder but the binder can fit snugly in front of the laptop case in the same laptop pocket. The document pocket does fit an A4 notepad by itself out of a sleeve. \n\nIn the rest of the space I have my keyboard and mouse in a bag, 1.5L waterbottle (which I might move to outside), bouldering shoes, small towel and a usb stick/cables case. \nAlso like the hard sunglasses pocket on top.\n\nIt sits upright by itself, doesn't seem to want to flop over. \n\nOriginally got the Bellroy Classic Backpack for $199 Aud but returned it as it just didn't feel well built especially for the price. Which was annoying as I liked the classic being basically 1 compartment. \n\nAlso liked the look of the Bellroy Melbourne but after looking at reviews the top magnet flap comes open when the bag is packed full. \n\nIt was close between this Thule and the Targus Citylite Pro Convertible (14L) (about $79 to $99 Aud) but feel like I'll get more use with the Thule, feels more sturdy and  I'll probably take it on day hikes etc too.\nAlso didn't like the 2nd main compartment of the Targus as I wanted something with essentially 1 main compartment and the Thule can essentially use all the volume in the main part with the other compartments not chewing up that space while sitting empty.\nAlso didn't want a back with a heap of inner pockets etc and with this one atleast they are minimal or easy to ignore as I just have things in cases and bring them out of the bag when I get to where I'm going and don't want to be digging through a bag, pockets, zips etc. \n\nLast bag before the everki was some Targus bag that I've had since 2012 that's held up amazingly. Was new old stock from 2006 and is still great, so was looking for a similar lifespan with this bag of 10 years or so use. \n\nMight make another post in a few months when I use this one a bit",
