When I pair that with a roller + backpack, it‚Äôs a pain. \n\nI discovered this subreddit and was instantly intrigued. A backpack and my golf roller would be an amazing upgrade.\n\nThe maiden voyage will be this coming week, 4 days in NYC. I packed 2 pants, 2 quarter zips, 1 crew neck sweatshirt, 3 t shirts, 1 blade polo, 4 underwear, 4 socks, MacBook, iPad, and the other travel essentials. \n\nMy golf bag carries my golf bag and golf shoes. \n\nThe Thule compression cubes, 1 medium and 2 small or 2 medium, fit perfectly in this backpack. I also found it has many useful pockets, and I got it on clearance for $99 which helped me choose it over the Patagonia MLC mini, although it was a tough choice between the two. \n\nUltimately I chose the Topo more because of the modularity. I might pick up the briefcase to layer on. \n\nSo, how‚Äôd I do?",

            "body": "So I owned and traveled with the old (original) Topo Designs Travel Bag. I think it was rated at 33L, but since they have taken down the info, I can‚Äôt be 100% sure. I traveled as a one bagger to various places, like two weeks in Colombia and a week in Hawai‚Äôi. It worked, though I had some issues with it, specifically the grab handles and the outside pocket. The two handles on the side would sometimes get in the way of my arm when I put the backpack straps on. And the outside pocket had zero depth, which made it really had to use as a one bag. I need to access a book, headphones, etc. from that pocket. \n\nWell, Topo Designs must have heard similar concerns because they released two new travel bags. They appear very similar to the original, but have improvements and now come in two sizes: 30L and 40L. \n\nI‚Äôve had both in my hands. The picture above is of the 40L, as my wife thought I would be too restricted with the 30L (meaning I wouldn‚Äôt have room to bring the kids‚Äô souvenirs back from a trip). So being a good husband, I returned the 30L and got the 40L. The differences are only in size. Dimensions are listed on the company‚Äôs website if you are interested. \n\nFirst off, the outside pocket has depth! It is so much better now. You have a small slit pocket on top of the outside pocket, great for tickets or other papers. (You can see it on the bottom right photo) The main outside pocket had depth, is LARGE, and has two zippered pockets. That‚Äôs it opened up in the bottom left photo. Yep, it opens all the way up. \n\nThey fixed the grab handles. Both side and top are single handles that sit closer to the bag (retracting a bit until you grab them) and are more comfortable. Very nicely done. \n\nThe top photo shows the main compartment. They originally had just a laptop sleeve/pouch on the inside back of the bag. Now, you can see they put mesh pockets on the top, and added two zippered areas in the main portion. The whole of the main compartment can them be unzipped to have access to the big area. Some may think this a little too much organization, others will like it. \n\nAnd finally, top far right you can see the opening for the laptop area. It is padded and has easy access. \n\nThe bag is very well made, huge solid zippers with great pulls on them. \n\nNow, I haven‚Äôt ever gotten to have a hands-on experience with a bag that has been redesigned other than this one, so know that. But I think Topo Designs did a fantastic job making a good bag great. I‚Äôd love to hear if anyone else has experience with their old or new travel bag. Plus, I‚Äôd be happy to answer any questions.",

I really like this one, but there is a reason they make it in other colors. \n\nThis is a backpack. You can stow the backpack straps and use the included shoulder strap, so then it looks like a giant messenger bag. I use the backpack straps.\n\nTHE BIGGIE is the dimensions. When I saw them, it was why I originally ordered the 30L. Well, I don't think the measurements on the website are entirely accurate. It is NOT 11 inches deep. With the outer pocket included, I'd say seven inches. For me, this lets the pack sit close to me back, which I really like. Also, I think it is really 22 inches tall and closer to 14 wide (not 23 and 16). You can also underpack it and squish it in a size bin. BUT I have never, not once, been stopped carrying it on (and I've never checked it). And as noted, it is brightly colored and easy to spot, so it wasn't like I was hiding it. \n\nAlso, the yellow, red and blue colors are the same as the Colombian national flag, so it called to me.

        "selftext": "Hey All, after many months of researching this thread and picking up supplies, I finally had the chance to travel for my first r/onebag trip this past weekend. Wanted to share some details of how everything went, as I promised many of you that I would. The photo attached is of my bag stowed away under the seat in front of me on a standard Jet Blue flight. Here goes nothing!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gear Used - 7 Day Trip**\n\n\\- [Topo Designs 30L Travel Bag](https://topodesigns.com/products/convertible-travel-bag-laptop-backpack-30l?variant=8546770485301)\n\n\\- [Topo Designs Pack Bag](https://topodesigns.com/collections/bag-organization/products/pack-bags?variant=840164401)\n\n\\- [Eagle Creek Pack-It Cube Set](https://www.rei.com/product/866241/eagle-creek-original-pack-it-cube-set)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Packable-ish Clothing Items**\n\n\\- [Lululemon Commission Pant Slim](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/Abc-Slim-5-Pocket-34/_/prod9090037?color=0001)\n\n\\- [Patagonia R1 Full Zip Mens Hoodie](https://www.rei.com/product/148190/patagonia-r1-full-zip-hoodie-mens)\n\n\\- [Patagonia Down Sweater](https://www.rei.com/product/871413/patagonia-down-sweater-mens)\n\n\\- [Uniqlo Airism Boxer Briefs](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-airism-boxer-briefs-420011COL09SMA005000.html?s=shopping&amp;&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA2vjuBRCqARIsAJL5a-JUu2NnYxiNPbnRyMX0QZZZB7qNXxjuLCncz5iU539wE1_Oy5rHIB0aAvINEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gear**\n\n[Topo Designs 30L:](https://topodesigns.com/products/convertible-travel-bag-laptop-backpack-30l?variant=8546770124853) Couldn't be happier with this purchase. Had already used it plenty of times for weekend trips, but never for a week or any longer. I was really on the fence between the 30L and the 40L, ultimately chose the 30L as the 40L felt a bit too large when i saw it in person. If you watch enough fold/pack tutorials you can easily fit enough for a 2-week to month-long trip using only this bag.\n\n\\- Build quality is fantastic\n\n\\- Black color is almost impossible to stain\n\n\\- Multiple ways to carry, with storable shoulder and hip straps\n\n\\- Attachments for my other Topo bags so that they combine as one (awesome detail)\n\n[Topo Designs Pack Bag:](https://topodesigns.com/products/pack-bags?variant=13521928945717) I used this instead of the large Eagle Creek pack bag from the kit simply because it is of much higher quality, but similar in size.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Eagle Creek Pack-it Cube Set:](https://www.rei.com/product/866241/eagle-creek-original-pack-it-cube-set) I saw another reddit member using these with my bag and they were the only pack bags I had seen that fit perfect without any overlap. I actually brought my bag to the local REI to test a couple different options, and these proved to fit the best without question, nothing came close.\n\n\\- Fit the 30L perfect with no extra bulge or additional room to move around, snug fit.\n\n\\- Although they fit great, it's important to mention they are not necessarily of the highest quality (mesh uppers will likely rip at some point)\n\n\\- These aren't compression bags so you'll have to do your best to pack them out\n\n\\- All in all, a solid pack bag set for a killer price\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Clothing Items**\n\nSingling out a few because each item on the list is truly incredible and deserves its own writeup. Feel free to PM me or comment with any specific questions, i'm happy to discuss or help out.\n\n[Lululemon Commission Pant:](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/Commission-Pant-Slim-Warpstreme-32/_/prod8600440?color=0001) Never in my life did I think i'd own anything from Lululemon - their pants and overall quality is no joke and what i consider to be the ULTIMATE travel pant.\n\n\\- Water resistant, considerable stretch, great pockets, wrinkle resistant, and packable!\n\n\\- I wear my pants cuffed, and these bad boys have a an awesome 3M detail once cuffed that i really loved.\n\n[Patagonia R1 Full Zip:](https://www.rei.com/product/148190/patagonia-r1-full-zip-hoodie-mens) Probably my favorite item i own. I opted for the full zip rather than pull over as i personally like to open my sweaters as I run warmer than the average person. I have been using this to layer for almost all my travel trips, commutes to work, and hiking on weekends. Truly a versatile, high quality piece.\n\n\\- Packs small, DWR finish for water resistance, front fleece-lined pockets to keep your hands warm.\n\n\\- The hood is INCREDIBLE and doubles as a balaclava when fully zipped. It covers your ears, chin, mouth, and zips up to just under your chin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe photo attached shows my bag fully packed and stowed under the seat in front of me on a standard Jet Blue flight. When i say standard, i mean no upgrade in seating or additional legroom. I could have stored it in the overhead, but wanted to have my items on me at all times. You'll notice it fits well, but i did have to tuck my feet under the bag at times to remain comfortable. I had more than enough items packed with me for this 7-day trip, and i'm really happy i went with the 30L. Super excited for longer trips in the future.\n\n\\- I'm 5'10 with average leg size, anyone above 6-feet may want to consider storing the bag in the overhead compartment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or feedback for future trips, i'm happy to help out! Thanks again to everyone in this community for being so kind and helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf1ndaruu8241.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c249a53c987c4ec7ab9bf648b717bb1328447d64",

In that bag I fit pants, shirts, etc. Next, I use the medium, and small size eagle creek pack bags from the kit - the original eagle creek large bag stays at home as a backup if needed. The medium eagle creek bag fits my shirts, underwear, and socks. The small eagle creek bag gets used as a mini Dopp kit - I saw someone else do that and didn‚Äôt think I could fit everything, but I did. \n\nIn doing this setup, all 3 cubes fit absolutely perfect in the main compartment, I even had some additional space to squeeze in a couple different items. \n\nI too have the Topo Dopp kit as well, but I leave this at home when I‚Äôm on longer trips because it takes up a lot of valuable space. I use the Topo Dopp kit for weekend trips with just a single pack bag. \n\nHope this helps out!",

The way it's designed with just the two wheels rather than four, it has two little bumper stops toward the front on the bottom so it sits flush when you want to stand it up to rest on its own. Mine kept on toppling forward, even when I'd load my heavy gear on the far inside / wheel side. I reached out to their customer service folks to ask about it and they were exceptionally cool and helpful, offered to replace it. I ended up fixing it by unzipping the little maintenance zipper inside where the bumper stops are mounted with a bolt and threaded nut and I re-drilled holes 1/4\" outward and forward to give it a bit wider stance and footprint, and this solved the issue completely for me. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but I thought I'd mention it just incase it helps someone else. It's very nearly a perfect carry-on bag. The backpack straps also work great, and are a super nice feature for when you're really trying to hustle through traffic, or traveling through different kinds of terrain where rolling it isn't practical, and it's too far to lug it with the handles.",

            "body": "I have this bag and recently used it on a trip to Europe and NYC. I too was surprised by the all-black interior (instead of the yellow in the pictures) which makes this bag very difficult to use in low light conditions, especially the mesh zippered compartments. You will be absolutely blind. I hate it. Now the website has a note about this, but it didn't when I got my bag.\n\nPros: The half hardcase, half soft exterior lets you pack fragile items safely. Be aware that if stuffed full it can get bigger than strict carry-on size. There are a LOT of sections / zippers / layers. If you underpack a bit, the bag is flexible - I could easily keep a down jacket, my raincoat, scarf, gloves, hat and a lightweight tote in the section between the admin panel and the main bag. The included shoulder straps are lightweight and easy to take along, but I would only use them in an emergency where I had to carry the bag, and only for a short distance. The red wheels are cool and distinctive. The bag is tough and able to be checked without damage. \n\nCons: You'll need to only pack flat things in the outside zipper pocket and in the admin panel section; there's not a lot of extra room. The top strap &amp; buckle to attach another bag just gets in the way and there is no way to stow it; I cut it off. The zippers are not lockable - you can stow the zippers beyond a fabric loop that makes it harder to open the bag, but it makes it hard for you to open it too - I just got a long wire lock and clipped the ends of the four zippers together. Used as a carry-on, because there are no compression straps, if you overpack the bag it may become too fat for strict airlines. I had to gate-check it on a US regional airliner, and in a Delta 777 it only fit sideways in the overhead compartment. I checked it coming home and it came through without a scratch. \n\nI found this bag to be flexible and tough. If you don't overpack it, you can use all of the zippered sections, which seem a bit fussy but can be very helpful for organization when you are living out of the bag.",

        "selftext": "I'm sick at home with covid instead of traveling, so here's some ramblings and photos for your entertainment. As a member of r/ultralight, I'm no stranger to taking a pair of scissors to a backpack.\n\nThe 30L Topo Travel Pack in black is a wonderful, feature rich, burly option that could work well for anyone and look good doing it. The only problem is that it seems like the designers knocked it out of the park, but then the marketing team told them to go add a few pointless features to a backpack that didn't need them. Some of these extra little bits don't really affect the use of the pack much, but a few of them really get in the way and make daily life/travel less seamless.\n\n**TLDR The Topo Travel Pack works much better with a few small annoyances removed.**\n\n[**Here's the photos.**](https://imgur.com/gallery/13DWRgp)\n\nHere's the full list of things I removed from the pack:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Sternum strap: Preference, I just don't need it.\n* Waist belt: removable. Also didn't need it for a 30L pack.\n* Shoulder Sling: If I wanted to buy a duffel, I would have.\n\nHere's where it gets fun:\n\n* [PackFast‚Ñ¢ Attachment system](https://i.shgcdn.com/e62c968b-a582-406b-ae9c-5eb476b15ce8/-/format/auto/-/preview/3000x3000/-/quality/lighter/): (2 clips/webbing) This drove me crazy. Every time you go to grab the top handle of the pack, your hand gets tangled up on the adjustable top clip for this pointless feature. Even if you use the packfast system to attach another topo pack to the outside of your travel pack, you now have an unwieldy, back heavy mass trying to pull you backwards and ruin your travel experience. I also cut off the bottom clip because it stuck out like an eyesore on an otherwise clean black minimal design.\n* Shoulder Sling D-rings: (2 D-rings/webbing) The pack comes with 2 d-rings for attaching a shoulder sling. This backpack has 2 wonderfully comfortable straps. Clean up your carry experience and get rid of that sling. This pack carries like a dream. The other problem with the top d-ring is that it sits squarely in the way of the laptop zipper. Before I cut it off, the D-ring would regularly get in the way, preventing me from zipping the laptop sleeve all of the way open. I cut the bottom one off as well, and I used these as pull tabs on a little zippered pouch I made.\n* Waist Belt webbing: (2 Webbing loops) After using the pack for over a year, never once using the included waist belt, I figured that the associated webbing loops need not stay either. The left webbing loop actually stays in the way of the laptop zipper at the bottom, preventing it from easily opening all of the way. I removed the other side so that it would match.\n\nBackground: I have used this pack for about 2 years now, using the pack almost daily for work meetings, Nepal for 5 months, India for 2 months, and daily back and forth between a cafe job and home for 7 months. The black version touts 1680d ballistic nylon, so mine hasn't started to show a hint of wear.",

I‚Äôve packed one week worth of clothes in it plus toiletries and such and it was a tight fit but I got it all in there. I have had to check it 2 or 3 times just from packing pocket knives or some other non allowed item in it and it came out fine every time, just a scuff on the white logo topo logo and on the hard side. The wheels are sturdy but I know that‚Äôs a failure point on a lot of other bags so one of the reasons I got this one was because I can easily swap out the wheels with roller blade wheels if they ever break or something.

I recently (randomly) up a [SoloNY briefcase w/ convertible backpack straps](https://smile.amazon.com/Laptop-Hybrid-Briefcase-Converts-Backpack/dp/B07F7RTYL9) and fell in love with the design. I loved the idea of having a business-ish briefcase that I could convert to backpack mode for longer and/or more packed-out carries. This bag was sleek and light but not made with the nicest materials.  \n\nI started looking for something of similar design, made with better quality materials, and possibly just a \\*little\\* bit bigger so I could fit a change of clothes into without the bag being insta-packed out/overstuffed. I saw the [pack hacker quick hit video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHjTH2Qh-Us) on this bag and then a few days later gleefully-but-randomly discovered the Topo Designs store at the Denver airport. They had this normally flashy bag in a full black finish and I was intrigued.  \n\nIn case anyone cares, I also have an [Osprey Farpoint 40](https://smile.amazon.com/Osprey-Farpoint-Travel-Backpack-Volcanic/dp/B014EBM3KA) that I use for 5-15+ day trips. I had a [40L Nomatic Travel Bag](https://www.amazon.com/NOMATIC-Water-Resistant-40L-Travel/dp/B0721NW4Z2) for a while and loooovvvvved it but the Farpoint carries way more comfortable, is lighter, and is a little more minimalist. But I digress‚Ä¶.\n\n**Review**\n\nI was ready to pay full price for this bag, but randomly found it on [nyglass.com](http://nyglass.com/) on sale; This site has some mixed feedback online but I took a chance and it paid off. This bag in ballistic black is normally $168 and I paid about \\~$72 shipped.  \n\nI‚Äôve only had it a few weeks, but I love the functionality of it. The materials and build quality are what I was looking for, and in the ballistic black finish w/ blacked out logo I‚Äôm digging the aesthetic. Over-the-shoulder/messenger-style carry feels comfortable for a 30-minute walk/train commute, but also works well while jumping in and out of a car or truck dressed up visiting clients.  I switch to backpack mode when it‚Äôs packed out and travelling. This frees up my hands for TSA goofiness or carrying some of the wife or dog‚Äôs gear. I find myself reaching for a sternum strap and then every time I realize I wouldn‚Äôt really need it.  \n\nNext to the SoloNY mentioned above, it is definitely a notch bigger. Topo advertises as 18.8L, some websites describe it as 23L. It feels more like 26-28L to me? I can easily fit as much stuff in this bag as I can my 29L Thule backpack and maybe more than my Nomatic backpack. I suppose the clamshell opening helps pack it out a bit easier perhaps?  \n\nWith the ballistic 1680 nylon material, it is heavier too. Heavier than advertised. My bag weighed in at 48oz and while they don‚Äôt list a weight on Topo‚Äôs site, other internet vendors list it at 35oz. I suppose the black 1680 ballistic nylon must be heavier than the 1000D the colored packs are made with but still‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a huge difference. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How do I use this bag?**\n\nThis is my daily carry bag, for now. I wanted a professional-looking daily carry that I could toss a packing cube, dopp kit, and pair of sandals into without having to change bags.  \n\nAfter a few weeks use, I carry it to work every day, throw in a change of gym clothes some days, and can easily pack for a weekend away. I took it on a road trip last weekend and it did everything I needed to, even when packing for blizzard conditions with bitter cold 0¬∞F ( -30¬∞ wind chill? it was COLD) MN weekend knowing I would be outside a lot.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What would I change?**\n\n* Lash-pints on the bottom of the bag ‚Äî I never use them.\n* Front pockets - zippers get caught on corners. Not horribly, but a little. To be expected.  \n* Backpack strap clips. UGH. Clipping/unclipping backpack straps is a PITA; requires two hands.  IDK what I would suggest instead.  \n* maybe add a sternum strap? idk if its necessary.\n* tech pocket is a nice amount of organization but wish it was the tiniest bit more stiff/padded.  \n* Ballistic 1680D material is nice, but I might like this bag just as much in all black &amp; lighter material. Not sure.  \n\n**What works well?**\n\n* The asthetic.  All black w/ black labels.  \n* The size. For my purpose/goals, it is just about right.  \n* The zippers. OMG the zippers on the main two compartments are YKK are big and beefy and are heavenly to operate!  \n* The single briefcase handle in the middle of the bag. Not two folded together with a buttoned flap to secure them together.  \n* Backpack straps stow away but just tucked and not zippered away securely. This is not a problem.",

I've been looking for an upgrade from my beloved Uniqlo 3-way bag, which is fantastic for the price, but could use just a bit more space, organization, and padding.  I liked the looks of the Topo 3-day but didn't think it was big enough, Uniqlo bag is supposedly \\~16L so I wanted something around 25L.  Definitely going to reconsider after seeing this though!",
