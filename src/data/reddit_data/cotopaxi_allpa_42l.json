            "body": "Hi all, below is my review fot Cotopaxi Allpa 42. You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

                "body": "MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION  \nThe main fabric of the bag is the TPU-coated 1000D polyester shell with 840 ballistic nylon paneling. In plain English it is a very durable, extremely water-resistant shell that feels a bit rubbery to the touch, does not stretch and is quite easy to maintain/clean.  \nThe zippers are all YKK with security loops everywhere. I really appreciated this touch on a travel bag, it made me worry less about the safety of my contents and focus more on the joy of my travel experience.  \nWithout beating around the bush, the Allpa 42 has a place for everything you need. Packing and unpacking was made easy thanks to the suitcase-style full-wrap zipper that allows you to see the entirety of the bag in just a few seconds.  \nExternally, there is:   \na single water bottle pocket, big enough to fit a 32 oz Nalgene.  \nA top quick-access pocket with generous volume to store anything from a small pouch to a phone, a wallet, your headphones, etc.... I generally don’t like storing my valuables in the quick access pocket since it’s easily accessible, not just by me but also by strangers. The Cotopaxi team, however, added a zipper locking loop on all pockets, so I did not worry about pickpockets as much.  \nInternally, you have:  \nA large zippered mesh compartment on the right side;  \nA subdivided zippered mesh compartments on the left side;  \nA padded laptop sleeve up to 15 inches;  \nA padded tablet sleeve up to 12.5 inches;  \nAnd a padded phone sleeve up to 6.5 inches.  \nIn my experience, I found that the built-in organization did not fully utilize the full size of the bag and that, if there was no organization at all, the bag would fit more things with external packing cubes. As someone who is already heavily invested into additional organization, I would prefer using my packing cubes instead of being restricted by the Allpa’s default compartments. In Cotopaxi’s defense, I feel like I am in the minority and most people would love that the Allpa already comes divided into useful compartments.  \nWHAT’S HOT  \nThe fun, colorful and unique aesthetic of the bag with a strong emotional feedback.  \nExcellent built-in organization with plenty of compartments, even for the most demanding folks.  \nGreat carrying comfort with load lifters and a removable hip belt, taking it to the next level.  \nMultiple access points: from clamshell opening to side access to the main compartment, the Allpa 42 was easy to use and handy to get to my things.  \nDurable, high-quality materials and overall build are confidence-inspiring.   \nWHAT’S NOT  \nThe built-in organization might not work for someone who’s already using specific packing cubes with dimensions not compatible with the compartments found in the Allpa.  \nThe boxy shape of the bag and the overall size might not work for everyone, but there are other Allpa sizes in case you need a smaller, more nimble solution.  \nVERDICT  \nThe Allpa 42 is a cool bag that brings forth the feeling that travel should be fun and filled with excitement and joy with its bright colors and playful aesthetic.  \nCotopaxi did a great job in creating a product that would embody the joy of the traveling experience while also making sure to provide great comfort and excellent organization. Everything about the bag is designed to allow you to focus on your travel and on not the stuff you are carrying with you. This is something very few bags managed to achieve.  \nIf you are looking for a one-bag travel solution with great built-in organization and are ready to embrace what the bag has to offer, the Allpa 42 should be at the top of your list.",

            "body": "Hi all, below is my review fot Cotopaxi Allpa 42. You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

I really appreciated this touch on a travel bag, it made me worry less about the safety of my contents and focus more on the joy of my travel experience.  \nWithout beating around the bush, the Allpa 42 has a place for everything you need. Packing and unpacking was made easy thanks to the suitcase-style full-wrap zipper that allows you to see the entirety of the bag in just a few seconds.  \nExternally, there is:   \na single water bottle pocket, big enough to fit a 32 oz Nalgene.  \nA top quick-access pocket with generous volume to store anything from a small pouch to a phone, a wallet, your headphones, etc.... I generally don’t like storing my valuables in the quick access pocket since it’s easily accessible, not just by me but also by strangers. The Cotopaxi team, however, added a zipper locking loop on all pockets, so I did not worry about pickpockets as much.  \nInternally, you have:  \nA large zippered mesh compartment on the right side;  \nA subdivided zippered mesh compartments on the left side;  \nA padded laptop sleeve up to 15 inches;  \nA padded tablet sleeve up to 12.5 inches;  \nAnd a padded phone sleeve up to 6.5 inches.  \nIn my experience, I found that the built-in organization did not fully utilize the full size of the bag and that, if there was no organization at all, the bag would fit more things with external packing cubes. As someone who is already heavily invested into additional organization, I would prefer using my packing cubes instead of being restricted by the Allpa’s default compartments. In Cotopaxi’s defense, I feel like I am in the minority and most people would love that the Allpa already comes divided into useful compartments.  \nWHAT’S HOT  \nThe fun, colorful and unique aesthetic of the bag with a strong emotional feedback.  \nExcellent built-in organization with plenty of compartments, even for the most demanding folks.  \nGreat carrying comfort with load lifters and a removable hip belt, taking it to the next level.  \nMultiple access points: from clamshell opening to side access to the main compartment, the Allpa 42 was easy to use and handy to get to my things.  \nDurable, high-quality materials and overall build are confidence-inspiring.   \nWHAT’S NOT  \nThe built-in organization might not work for someone who’s already using specific packing cubes with dimensions not compatible with the compartments found in the Allpa.  \nThe boxy shape of the bag and the overall size might not work for everyone, but there are other Allpa sizes in case you need a smaller, more nimble solution.  \nVERDICT  \nThe Allpa 42 is a cool bag that brings forth the feeling that travel should be fun and filled with excitement and joy with its bright colors and playful aesthetic.  \nCotopaxi did a great job in creating a product that would embody the joy of the traveling experience while also making sure to provide great comfort and excellent organization. Everything about the bag is designed to allow you to focus on your travel and on not the stuff you are carrying with you. This is something very few bags managed to achieve.  \nIf you are looking for a one-bag travel solution with great built-in organization and are ready to embrace what the bag has to offer, the Allpa 42 should be at the top of your list.",

            "body": "Hi all, below is my review fot Cotopaxi Allpa 42. You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

I generally don’t like storing my valuables in the quick access pocket since it’s easily accessible, not just by me but also by strangers.

            "body": "Hi all, below is my review fot Cotopaxi Allpa 42. You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

                "body": "MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION  \nThe main fabric of the bag is the TPU-coated 1000D polyester shell with 840 ballistic nylon paneling. In plain English it is a very durable, extremely water-resistant shell that feels a bit rubbery to the touch, does not stretch and is quite easy to maintain/clean.  \nThe zippers are all YKK with security loops everywhere. I really appreciated this touch on a travel bag, it made me worry less about the safety of my contents and focus more on the joy of my travel experience.  \nWithout beating around the bush, the Allpa 42 has a place for everything you need. Packing and unpacking was made easy thanks to the suitcase-style full-wrap zipper that allows you to see the entirety of the bag in just a few seconds.  \nExternally, there is:   \na single water bottle pocket, big enough to fit a 32 oz Nalgene.  \nA top quick-access pocket with generous volume to store anything from a small pouch to a phone, a wallet, your headphones, etc.... I generally don’t like storing my valuables in the quick access pocket since it’s easily accessible, not just by me but also by strangers. The Cotopaxi team, however, added a zipper locking loop on all pockets, so I did not worry about pickpockets as much.  \nInternally, you have:  \nA large zippered mesh compartment on the right side;  \nA subdivided zippered mesh compartments on the left side;  \nA padded laptop sleeve up to 15 inches;  \nA padded tablet sleeve up to 12.5 inches;  \nAnd a padded phone sleeve up to 6.5 inches.  \nIn my experience, I found that the built-in organization did not fully utilize the full size of the bag and that, if there was no organization at all, the bag would fit more things with external packing cubes. As someone who is already heavily invested into additional organization, I would prefer using my packing cubes instead of being restricted by the Allpa’s default compartments. In Cotopaxi’s defense, I feel like I am in the minority and most people would love that the Allpa already comes divided into useful compartments.  \nWHAT’S HOT  \nThe fun, colorful and unique aesthetic of the bag with a strong emotional feedback.  \nExcellent built-in organization with plenty of compartments, even for the most demanding folks.  \nGreat carrying comfort with load lifters and a removable hip belt, taking it to the next level.  \nMultiple access points: from clamshell opening to side access to the main compartment, the Allpa 42 was easy to use and handy to get to my things.  \nDurable, high-quality materials and overall build are confidence-inspiring.   \nWHAT’S NOT  \nThe built-in organization might not work for someone who’s already using specific packing cubes with dimensions not compatible with the compartments found in the Allpa.  \nThe boxy shape of the bag and the overall size might not work for everyone, but there are other Allpa sizes in case you need a smaller, more nimble solution.  \nVERDICT  \nThe Allpa 42 is a cool bag that brings forth the feeling that travel should be fun and filled with excitement and joy with its bright colors and playful aesthetic.  \nCotopaxi did a great job in creating a product that would embody the joy of the traveling experience while also making sure to provide great comfort and excellent organization. Everything about the bag is designed to allow you to focus on your travel and on not the stuff you are carrying with you. This is something very few bags managed to achieve.  \nIf you are looking for a one-bag travel solution with great built-in organization and are ready to embrace what the bag has to offer, the Allpa 42 should be at the top of your list.",

I generally don’t like storing my valuables in the quick access pocket since it’s easily accessible, not just by me but also by strangers. The Cotopaxi team, however, added a zipper locking loop on all pockets, so I did not worry about pickpockets as much.  \nInternally, you have:  \nA large zippered mesh compartment on the right side;  \nA subdivided zippered mesh compartments on the left side;  \nA padded laptop sleeve up to 15 inches;  \nA padded tablet sleeve up to 12.5 inches;  \nAnd a padded phone sleeve up to 6.5 inches.  \nIn my experience, I found that the built-in organization did not fully utilize the full size of the bag and that, if there was no organization at all, the bag would fit more things with external packing cubes. As someone who is already heavily invested into additional organization, I would prefer using my packing cubes instead of being restricted by the Allpa’s default compartments. In Cotopaxi’s defense, I feel like I am in the minority and most people would love that the Allpa already comes divided into useful compartments.  \nWHAT’S HOT  \nThe fun, colorful and unique aesthetic of the bag with a strong emotional feedback.  \nExcellent built-in organization with plenty of compartments, even for the most demanding folks.  \nGreat carrying comfort with load lifters and a removable hip belt, taking it to the next level.  \nMultiple access points: from clamshell opening to side access to the main compartment, the Allpa 42 was easy to use and handy to get to my things.  \nDurable, high-quality materials and overall build are confidence-inspiring.   \nWHAT’S NOT  \nThe built-in organization might not work for someone who’s already using specific packing cubes with dimensions not compatible with the compartments found in the Allpa.  \nThe boxy shape of the bag and the overall size might not work for everyone, but there are other Allpa sizes in case you need a smaller, more nimble solution.  \nVERDICT  \nThe Allpa 42 is a cool bag that brings forth the feeling that travel should be fun and filled with excitement and joy with its bright colors and playful aesthetic.  \nCotopaxi did a great job in creating a product that would embody the joy of the traveling experience while also making sure to provide great comfort and excellent organization. Everything about the bag is designed to allow you to focus on your travel and on not the stuff you are carrying with you. This is something very few bags managed to achieve.  \nIf you are looking for a one-bag travel solution with great built-in organization and are ready to embrace what the bag has to offer, the Allpa 42 should be at the top of your list.",

            "body": "Hi all, below is my review fot Cotopaxi Allpa 42. You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

                "body": "MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION  \nThe main fabric of the bag is the TPU-coated 1000D polyester shell with 840 ballistic nylon paneling. In plain English it is a very durable, extremely water-resistant shell that feels a bit rubbery to the touch, does not stretch and is quite easy to maintain/clean.  \nThe zippers are all YKK with security loops everywhere. I really appreciated this touch on a travel bag, it made me worry less about the safety of my contents and focus more on the joy of my travel experience.  \nWithout beating around the bush, the Allpa 42 has a place for everything you need. Packing and unpacking was made easy thanks to the suitcase-style full-wrap zipper that allows you to see the entirety of the bag in just a few seconds.  \nExternally, there is:   \na single water bottle pocket, big enough to fit a 32 oz Nalgene.  \nA top quick-access pocket with generous volume to store anything from a small pouch to a phone, a wallet, your headphones, etc....

In plain English it is a very durable, extremely water-resistant shell that feels a bit rubbery to the touch, does not stretch and is quite easy to maintain/clean.  \nThe zippers are all YKK with security loops everywhere. I really appreciated this touch on a travel bag, it made me worry less about the safety of my contents and focus more on the joy of my travel experience.  \nWithout beating around the bush, the Allpa 42 has a place for everything you need. Packing and unpacking was made easy thanks to the suitcase-style full-wrap zipper that allows you to see the entirety of the bag in just a few seconds.  \nExternally, there is:   \na single water bottle pocket, big enough to fit a 32 oz Nalgene.  \nA top quick-access pocket with generous volume to store anything from a small pouch to a phone, a wallet, your headphones, etc.... I generally don’t like storing my valuables in the quick access pocket since it’s easily accessible, not just by me but also by strangers. The Cotopaxi team, however, added a zipper locking loop on all pockets, so I did not worry about pickpockets as much.  \nInternally, you have:  \nA large zippered mesh compartment on the right side;  \nA subdivided zippered mesh compartments on the left side;  \nA padded laptop sleeve up to 15 inches;  \nA padded tablet sleeve up to 12.5 inches;  \nAnd a padded phone sleeve up to 6.5 inches.  \nIn my experience, I found that the built-in organization did not fully utilize the full size of the bag and that, if there was no organization at all, the bag would fit more things with external packing cubes. As someone who is already heavily invested into additional organization, I would prefer using my packing cubes instead of being restricted by the Allpa’s default compartments. In Cotopaxi’s defense, I feel like I am in the minority and most people would love that the Allpa already comes divided into useful compartments.  \nWHAT’S HOT  \nThe fun, colorful and unique aesthetic of the bag with a strong emotional feedback.  \nExcellent built-in organization with plenty of compartments, even for the most demanding folks.  \nGreat carrying comfort with load lifters and a removable hip belt, taking it to the next level.  \nMultiple access points: from clamshell opening to side access to the main compartment, the Allpa 42 was easy to use and handy to get to my things.  \nDurable, high-quality materials and overall build are confidence-inspiring.   \nWHAT’S NOT  \nThe built-in organization might not work for someone who’s already using specific packing cubes with dimensions not compatible with the compartments found in the Allpa.  \nThe boxy shape of the bag and the overall size might not work for everyone, but there are other Allpa sizes in case you need a smaller, more nimble solution.  \nVERDICT  \nThe Allpa 42 is a cool bag that brings forth the feeling that travel should be fun and filled with excitement and joy with its bright colors and playful aesthetic.  \nCotopaxi did a great job in creating a product that would embody the joy of the traveling experience while also making sure to provide great comfort and excellent organization. Everything about the bag is designed to allow you to focus on your travel and on not the stuff you are carrying with you. This is something very few bags managed to achieve.  \nIf you are looking for a one-bag travel solution with great built-in organization and are ready to embrace what the bag has to offer, the Allpa 42 should be at the top of your list.",

            "body": "Hi all, below is my review fot Cotopaxi Allpa 42. You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load.

            "body": "Hi all, below is my review fot Cotopaxi Allpa 42. You can also check it on my blog with more images [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/cotopaxi-allpa-42-review)  \n\n\nAs always, ask me anything :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOREWORD  \nFor some, travel is an arduous road, filled with sleepless nights, less than comfortable living conditions, and the constant unpleasantness of being outside of your comfort zone. For others, it’s an adventure filled with joy, unexpected connections, and memories that stay with you forever. It seems that the folks at Cotopaxi clearly belong to the latter group based on their comfortable, functional, and uniquely fun bags.  \nToday I would like to tell the story of an unsung hero of one-bag travel: the Allpa 42 bag from Cotopaxi.  \nWHO IT SUITS  \nThose who practice minimal travel and need a carry-on compatible bag.  \nAnyone who doesn’t settle for bland colors and is looking for a colorful travel bag.   \nThose who appreciate the clever built-in organization of their bags and are looking for quick access to their stuff. These folk will love all the pockets offered, as well as the side access to the laptop compartment and the main compartment.  \nWHO IT DOESN’T  \nThose who are heavily invested in pouches and organizers might find the Allpa 42 somewhat restricting since the bag asks you to adapt to it instead of the other way around.  \nABOUT THE BAG  \nPRICE: $220   \nWEIGHT (bag only): 4lb 3oz (1905g)  \nDIMENSIONS: 21.5 x 13 x 9in (55 x 34 x 22.5cm)  \nCAPACITY: 42L (2563cu in)  \nDESIGN &amp; FEATURES  \nIf I were to describe the Allpa 42 in a single word, it would be “FUN”. The playful lama logo on the front, the vibrant blue color of my indigo version, the bright colorful zippers and zipper pulls, everything about the bag just sparks joy and excitement to hit the road and explore the world. I’ve had plenty of bags that were “mission ready” or “built to withstand anything” and these were reliable and confidence-inspiring for sure. But I don’t recall coming across a travel bag that would just scream “travel is dope, let’s do it!” with every fiber and every detail. Somehow the Cotopaxi team managed to capture that wanderlust that is often forgotten and neglected in a daily routine.  \nThe design is quite simple, yet clever. The Allpa 42 has a distinct rectangular shape to ensure that a maximum of usable space is offered for things inside. Bright colors allow your friends to quickly notice you in a crowded airport and definitely help to identify the bag in the bag claim area, in case you had to check it in. Be prepared, however, that some budget airlines might find the bag non-compliant with their carry-on regulations.  \nThe standout features of the bag are:  \nFull suitcase-style zipper that allows opening the bag clamshell-style for easy packing/unpacking.  \nSide access to the main compartment makes it easy to grab things without the need to open the main zipper compartment.  \nBrilliant built-in organization with zippered compartments dividing the capacity of the bag into sections to be filled individually. These are basically built-in packing cubes that you are never going to lose or forget in the hotel.  \nAn included bright orange rain cover. This can be great to not only further protect the bag from the elements but is also highly recommended in case you check in the bag to keep it from getting dirty/scuffed.   \n4 lowkey lash points on the outside allow attaching extra gear like a jacket, water bottle, etc... with a carabiner.  \nThe straps are stowable, which is great when carrying the bag briefcase style or if you need to check in the bag.  \nMultiple carry modes: backpack, briefcase, shoulder bag. So super adaptable to different scenarios.  \nOverall the design of and features on the Allpa 42 complement each other well, without making the bag feel overengineered or unnecessary complex. Everything is intuitive and easy to use. Great job, Cotopaxi!  \nCOMFORT  \nI was relieved to find out that the Allpa 42 is not only a joy to look at, but also to carry. The wide, moderately padded, countered shoulder straps pleasantly hugged my body and did a great job in distributing even a heavy load. The back panel has a decent amount of mesh and overall complements the straps really well.  \nTo get the bag to sit even more comfortably and distribute the weight further, there are load lifters on the straps and a wide, removable hip belt that takes the comfort from great to simply excellent.  \nFurthermore, there are 4 grab handles around the bag that are all very comfortable and durable, reinforced and double stitched to withstand anything. I loved the fact that I could grab the bag from any side and also carry the bag as a briefcase.   \nThere is also a removable shoulder strap that allows carrying the bag across the body or on the shoulder. I found it adequate and quite handy during my travels.  \nTo sum up, the folks at Cotopaxi nailed the comfort aspect of the bag and that’s already a serious achievement considering the overall size and capacity of the bag. Bonus points for keeping the weight of the empty bag below 2kg.",

                "body": "MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION  \nThe main fabric of the bag is the TPU-coated 1000D polyester shell with 840 ballistic nylon paneling. In plain English it is a very durable, extremely water-resistant shell that feels a bit rubbery to the touch, does not stretch and is quite easy to maintain/clean.  \nThe zippers are all YKK with security loops everywhere. I really appreciated this touch on a travel bag, it made me worry less about the safety of my contents and focus more on the joy of my travel experience.  \nWithout beating around the bush, the Allpa 42 has a place for everything you need. Packing and unpacking was made easy thanks to the suitcase-style full-wrap zipper that allows you to see the entirety of the bag in just a few seconds.  \nExternally, there is:   \na single water bottle pocket, big enough to fit a 32 oz Nalgene.  \nA top quick-access pocket with generous volume to store anything from a small pouch to a phone, a wallet, your headphones, etc.... I generally don’t like storing my valuables in the quick access pocket since it’s easily accessible, not just by me but also by strangers. The Cotopaxi team, however, added a zipper locking loop on all pockets, so I did not worry about pickpockets as much.  \nInternally, you have:  \nA large zippered mesh compartment on the right side;  \nA subdivided zippered mesh compartments on the left side;  \nA padded laptop sleeve up to 15 inches;  \nA padded tablet sleeve up to 12.5 inches;  \nAnd a padded phone sleeve up to 6.5 inches.  \nIn my experience, I found that the built-in organization did not fully utilize the full size of the bag and that, if there was no organization at all, the bag would fit more things with external packing cubes. As someone who is already heavily invested into additional organization, I would prefer using my packing cubes instead of being restricted by the Allpa’s default compartments. In Cotopaxi’s defense, I feel like I am in the minority and most people would love that the Allpa already comes divided into useful compartments.  \nWHAT’S HOT  \nThe fun, colorful and unique aesthetic of the bag with a strong emotional feedback.  \nExcellent built-in organization with plenty of compartments, even for the most demanding folks.  \nGreat carrying comfort with load lifters and a removable hip belt, taking it to the next level.  \nMultiple access points: from clamshell opening to side access to the main compartment, the Allpa 42 was easy to use and handy to get to my things.  \nDurable, high-quality materials and overall build are confidence-inspiring.   \nWHAT’S NOT  \nThe built-in organization might not work for someone who’s already using specific packing cubes with dimensions not compatible with the compartments found in the Allpa.  \nThe boxy shape of the bag and the overall size might not work for everyone, but there are other Allpa sizes in case you need a smaller, more nimble solution.  \nVERDICT  \nThe Allpa 42 is a cool bag that brings forth the feeling that travel should be fun and filled with excitement and joy with its bright colors and playful aesthetic.  \nCotopaxi did a great job in creating a product that would embody the joy of the traveling experience while also making sure to provide great comfort and excellent organization. Everything about the bag is designed to allow you to focus on your travel and on not the stuff you are carrying with you. This is something very few bags managed to achieve.  \nIf you are looking for a one-bag travel solution with great built-in organization and are ready to embrace what the bag has to offer, the Allpa 42 should be at the top of your list.",

        "selftext": "Hello! \n\nTagging onto this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/s/3t8pnGl0Pm\n\nI haven’t taken my trip yet (10 days in Geneva and south of France end of February), but went to the Cotopaxi store to buy the 35L in a similar color scheme and with the water bottle attachment this weekend because I’m worried about the size of the 42L. I packed the 35L up and it was quite snug, but still had room if I needed to add some souvenirs and small things. \n\nI’m driving my partner crazy because I can’t decide which bag to return. \n\nThe 35L (22x12x10) is definitely smaller than the 42L (22x14x11) in all dimensions - height too, even though it’s supposed to be the same. You can only tell when they’re side by side though. The 42L has a lot of extra room where the 35L looks packed out when I have them packed for my trip. You can see the photos of the packed out 42L in my last post. \n\nI stuffed the 42L with a queen sized fleece blanket in the main right side, a couch pillow on the left side and an extra random packing cube in the top exterior pocket to fill it up for comparison photos. I put the bags on and didn’t see a difference in size on me. \n\nThe differences of the bags are in size and organization (see photos). The 42L has a longer top pocket on the left side when you open it, and it’s split into two smaller pockets on the 35L. The left side also has a solid zipped compartment that’s about two thirds of the bag with an additional mesh pocket on top of it, and the 35L only has a mesh pocket, but the pocket goes all the way to the top, but the exterior pocket uses this space anyway. The 42L has three  built in slide pockets inside the top exterior pocket where the 35L has none. The laptop section of the 42L also has an extra slide pocket and the 35L doesn’t. The 42L also has load lifters that the 35L doesn’t. \n\nI added the strap from my old Ebag Motherlode to the 35L since Cotopaxi doesn’t sell the straps. FYI: I learned at the store that the 42L side pocket is NOT a tiny water bottle pocket, but a pocket to stash the strap in. The water bottle attachment looks fine and works well BTW for $10. \n\nAnyway, I’m having trouble deciding which one to return because I like all the extra pockets on the 42L, and like that it has more capacity, but I have anxiety about to getting flagged to weigh or check my bag. I wonder if it looking more smooth when packed will make it look smaller overall. I’m nervous that the 35L looks lumpy so it looks fuller. Please help me decide which one to return.  TIA!!\n\nIf you’re curious, here’s my new packing list: \n\nRight side (from bottom up):\n\nCurling iron at the bottom of the bag (not visible)\n\nLarge compression packing cube: \n\n- 2 pairs of leggings \n- 1 pair of heat tech leggings to layer \n- 1 black dress I can dress up or wear casually \n\nMedium compression cube: \n\n- 2 Uniqlo heat tech long sleeves - 1 scoop neck and 1 high neck)\n\n- 3 tops \n- 2 heat tech long sleeves \n - 1 black comfy cropped high neck sweater\n- 2 long sleeved thing cropped snap button cardigans I’m planning to layer and toss during the first two days in Geneva when it’ll be coldest \n\nSmall compression packing cube: \n- 8 pairs of underwear \n- 2 bras\n\nAlso 4 pairs of socks stuffed to the left side of everything. \n\nLeft side bottom pocket: \n\n- hanging toiletry bag\n- dry toiletries bag with medicine, nail clippers, etc. \n- makeup bag (not pictured but will fit) \n- massage ball \n- I have a laundry bag on the left side top pocket and face cloths on the right\n\nExterior pocket: \n- Tech bag \n- Wet toiletries \n- Feminine products in the back zip pocket, jacket strap thing, and face mask.  \n\nLaptop pocket: \n\n- plastic compression bag for dirty clothes \n- extra zip lock bags",

        "selftext": "Hello! \n\nTagging onto this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/s/3t8pnGl0Pm\n\nI haven’t taken my trip yet (10 days in Geneva and south of France end of February), but went to the Cotopaxi store to buy the 35L in a similar color scheme and with the water bottle attachment this weekend because I’m worried about the size of the 42L. I packed the 35L up and it was quite snug, but still had room if I needed to add some souvenirs and small things. \n\nI’m driving my partner crazy because I can’t decide which bag to return. \n\nThe 35L (22x12x10) is definitely smaller than the 42L (22x14x11) in all dimensions - height too, even though it’s supposed to be the same. You can only tell when they’re side by side though. The 42L has a lot of extra room where the 35L looks packed out when I have them packed for my trip. You can see the photos of the packed out 42L in my last post. \n\nI stuffed the 42L with a queen sized fleece blanket in the main right side, a couch pillow on the left side and an extra random packing cube in the top exterior pocket to fill it up for comparison photos. I put the bags on and didn’t see a difference in size on me. \n\nThe differences of the bags are in size and organization (see photos). The 42L has a longer top pocket on the left side when you open it, and it’s split into two smaller pockets on the 35L. The left side also has a solid zipped compartment that’s about two thirds of the bag with an additional mesh pocket on top of it, and the 35L only has a mesh pocket, but the pocket goes all the way to the top, but the exterior pocket uses this space anyway. The 42L has three  built in slide pockets inside the top exterior pocket where the 35L has none. The laptop section of the 42L also has an extra slide pocket and the 35L doesn’t. The 42L also has load lifters that the 35L doesn’t. \n\nI added the strap from my old Ebag Motherlode to the 35L since Cotopaxi doesn’t sell the straps. FYI: I learned at the store that the 42L side pocket is NOT a tiny water bottle pocket, but a pocket to stash the strap in. The water bottle attachment looks fine and works well BTW for $10. \n\nAnyway, I’m having trouble deciding which one to return because I like all the extra pockets on the 42L, and like that it has more capacity, but I have anxiety about to getting flagged to weigh or check my bag. I wonder if it looking more smooth when packed will make it look smaller overall. I’m nervous that the 35L looks lumpy so it looks fuller. Please help me decide which one to return.  TIA!!\n\nIf you’re curious, here’s my new packing list: \n\nRight side (from bottom up):\n\nCurling iron at the bottom of the bag (not visible)\n\nLarge compression packing cube: \n\n- 2 pairs of leggings \n- 1 pair of heat tech leggings to layer \n- 1 black dress I can dress up or wear casually \n\nMedium compression cube: \n\n- 2 Uniqlo heat tech long sleeves - 1 scoop neck and 1 high neck)\n\n- 3 tops \n- 2 heat tech long sleeves \n - 1 black comfy cropped high neck sweater\n- 2 long sleeved thing cropped snap button cardigans I’m planning to layer and toss during the first two days in Geneva when it’ll be coldest \n\nSmall compression packing cube: \n- 8 pairs of underwear \n- 2 bras\n\nAlso 4 pairs of socks stuffed to the left side of everything. \n\nLeft side bottom pocket: \n\n- hanging toiletry bag\n- dry toiletries bag with medicine, nail clippers, etc. \n- makeup bag (not pictured but will fit) \n- massage ball \n- I have a laundry bag on the left side top pocket and face cloths on the right\n\nExterior pocket: \n- Tech bag \n- Wet toiletries \n- Feminine products in the back zip pocket, jacket strap thing, and face mask.  \n\nLaptop pocket: \n\n- plastic compression bag for dirty clothes \n- extra zip lock bags",

The water bottle attachment looks fine and works well BTW for $10. \n\nAnyway, I’m having trouble deciding which one to return because I like all the extra pockets on the 42L, and like that it has more capacity, but I have anxiety about to getting flagged to weigh or check my bag.

I would imagine that call-out would be pretty consistent if the bag were any larger. \n\nThat being said, I was able to pack my 35L for 19 days in Croatia and Italy, which included fancy clothes for a Michelin-starred dinner (40th birthday treat to me!) and a wedding at an Italian villa, and still had space to pick up a few fun things to bring home with me.

I was having a really hard time telling myself to not go with the 42L because I looooved the extra pockets and load lifters. But you know what I didn't love? Having to check it. I flew TAP and 3 out of 4 times they asked me to check my bag. The one time I brought it on with me, it actually fit in the overhead easily (it wasn't packed full though). But since it seemed like I'd be asked to check it often, I returned the 42L.\n\nI have no regrets though. The 35L still had plenty of room for me and the hip belt was enough to take the load off my shoulders. I did 10 days in Taiwan and it was perfect. Even managed to fit it under the seat (not fully packed, but mostly) on the intl United flight.\n\nIf you DO go with the 42L, I think people might ignore it if it's on your back, but if you use the duffel strap, they're more likely to flag it. That's my theory.",

        "selftext": "I wanted to share my experience with the updated Cotopaxi Allpa 42L Travel Pack, and let me tell you, this bag has been a game-changer for my travels.\nFor context, I'm not exactly built like a nimble backpacker. At 6'2\", finding bags that feel comfortable and don't look comically small on me has always been a challenge.  I've tried various carry-on options over the years, often feeling like I was sacrificing either capacity or comfort. The Allpa 42L, however, has absolutely nailed it.\n\nFirst Impressions: Style Meets Substance\n\nRight out of the box, I was impressed with the look of this bag. The design is distinctive and stylish. It stands out without being overly flashy.  More importantly, the build quality feels incredibly robust. You can tell this bag is made to withstand some serious travel.\n\nCapacity Champ (Even for a Big Guy!)\n\nThe real test came with my recent two-week trip to Belize.  I was honestly a little skeptical if a \"carry-on\" could handle that much, especially considering my size. But the Allpa 42L absolutely delivered. I was able to comfortably pack:\n * A week's worth of clothes (including some bulkier items)\n * My 15\" laptop in the dedicated sleeve (snug and secure!). The security zipper on the laptop compartment is a really nice touch for peace of mind.\n * My tablet in its own padded pocket\n * A toiletry bag\n * A snorkel and mask\n * Various chargers, cables, and other essentials\nAnd honestly, I probably could have squeezed in a bit more! The internal organization is fantastic, with the clamshell opening and zippered mesh compartments making packing and accessing everything a breeze. No more digging through a giant void!\n\nComfort Considerations (For Fellow Tall Folks)\n\nWhile this version doesn't have load lifters, I found the sternum strap to be surprisingly adequate in distributing the weight.  The fact that the straps can be stowed away neatly is a definite plus, especially when using it as more of a suitcase-style carry-on for loading and unloading into the ovearhead.\n\nAreas for Improvement (Minor Points)\n\nOne aspect that's worth noting for taller users is that the harness system isn't ideally designed for those of us with longer torsos. The hip belt tends to sit a bit higher than optimal. While I didn't find it to be a dealbreaker for my use, it's something to be aware of if you're on the taller side.\n\nBeyond the Big Trip: Versatility for Shorter Jaunts\n\nWhat's even more impressive is its versatility. In addition to that longer trip, I've used the Allpa for shorter weekend getaways.  And here's a testament to its capacity: I was able to pack both my stuff and my daughter's belongings into it, allowing us to travel with just one carry-on. This was a game-changer for navigating airports with a little one in tow!\n\nFinal Verdict: My Go-To Travel Companion\n\nThe updated Cotopaxi Allpa 42L has quickly become my favorite travel bag. It strikes a great balance between capacity, comfort (with some considerations for taller users), durability, and style.  If you're looking for a versatile and well-designed travel pack that can handle everything from short weekend trips to longer adventures, and you appreciate a bag that's well-organized and relatively comfortable even with the harness limitations for taller folks, I wholeheartedly recommend giving the Allpa 42L a serious look.",

This last trip involved Ubers, flights (commercial and small puddle jumpers), water taxis and golf carts.  So the bag got tossed around and wasn't handled very carefully at times. \nA quick wipe down with a damp cloth when I got home and it's looking good as new.\n\nAlso, I don't think that Taal bag gets talked about enough. Ive actually been getting a lot of use out it during my travels, it's become a handy dad bag for me.  I can pack some wet wipes, tissues and other essentials in the discreet pockets, throw a water bottle in the interior water bottle pocket, toss in a hoodie, or shopping from a market, etc.  \nIt also came in handy as a personal item as I would just toss my sling bag, tablet, snacks, water bottle, etc into in for easy access at my seat.",

Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday.

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

        "selftext": "I’m planning on a RTW trip (from London to SE Asia / Australia by land and sea) next year, and am using a 3 week trip to Cuba in April as my practice run for Onebagging. \n\nI‘ve had my eye on the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L for a while but has been out of stock in the UK since I began searching. Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question! Updates to come…\n\nPictures attached.",

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing.

        "selftext": "I’m planning on a RTW trip (from London to SE Asia / Australia by land and sea) next year, and am using a 3 week trip to Cuba in April as my practice run for Onebagging. \n\nI‘ve had my eye on the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L for a while but has been out of stock in the UK since I began searching. Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question! Updates to come…\n\nPictures attached.",

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

Historically, I’ve always overpacked - options are fun and less decisions to make while packing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  I’ve also realized I end up not wearing half of what I brought. This group has really inspired me! \n\nWe will be doing laundry as needed—handwashing and/or using hotel machines. Most of the clothes in my kit will be hand-washed. \n\nMy main bag is the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L. My daypack is the Cotopaxi Batac 16L, which will also serve as my personal item on the plane. The Batac will be tucked into the Allpa while commuting to/from airports, hotels, on trains, etc.\n\nA few things not shown: Apple Watch charger, a nice shirt for going out (either packing it or buying it in Japan), belt. I may pack a couple more socks and underwear. I’m also making a snack pack to bring along.\n\nI did a full pack including the clothes I’ll be wearing on the plane, just to see how it all feels and to make sure there’s extra room for shopping. So far I’m at 19.8 lbs.\n\nGEAR\nBag - Cotopaxi Allpa 42L\nDaypack - 16L Cotopaxi Batac\nGarment Folder - Eagle Creek (Large, without plastic folding insert)\nPacking Cube - 5L Cotopaxi (long/narrow)\nPacking Cubes - Set of 3 (might bring 1–2 for daypack or organizing souvenirs)\nToiletry Bag - Columbia Mazama Travel Kit (filled with all the usuals, tooth brush, deodorant, etc…)\n\n\nCLOTHING (including what I’ll be wearing on the plane)\nPants (1/2) - Ketl Shenanigan pants (grey)\nPants (1/2) - Still deciding between Mavi dark blue jeans (thin/stretchy) or Levi XX Chinos (both are in the photo, but only bringing 2 pants total)\nShirt (1/5) - 72-Hour Merino long sleeve\nShirt (1/5) - 72-Hour Merino polo\nShirts (3/5) - Unbound Merino crew T-shirts (black, charcoal, vintage indigo)\nShorts (1/2) - Fabletics One athletic shorts\nShorts (1/2) - Chubbies Everywhere Shorts\nSocks (1/3) - Darn Tough Light Hiker Lightweight Hiking Socks\nSocks (1/3) - Darn Tough Run Ultralightweight Socks\nSocks (1/3) - Darn Tough Light Hiker No Show Socks\nUndies (1/4) - Smartwool boxer brief\nUndies (3/4) - Under Armour Tech Boxer Briefs\nShoes (1/2) - Xero 360\nShoes (1/2) - Xero Ridgeway Mesh Low\nJacket (1) - Surprisingly packable bomber jacket (fits in 5L cube)\nRain Jacket (1) - Very lightweight Fabletics rain jacket\n\n\nGADGETS\niPad\niPhone\nFast charger plug with 2 USB-C ports\nUSB-B cable for AirPods\nCharging cables\nApple Watch\niPhone\nAirPods Pro\nSunglasses\nRegular glasses\nEarplugs\n\n\nOTHER\nLaundry detergent sheets\nEucalan wool detergent\nDisposable face masks\nHand sanitizer (will probably buy there)\nSnacks\nOwala water bottle\nGlasses case\n\n\nSTILL NEED\nTravel neck pillow – Any suggestions?

Two at most and a small container of any modern clothes detergent like Tide HE to wash clothes in the hotel sink or wastebasket, press between bath towels, hung to dry overnight and if needed (or you're in a hurry) with the hotel hair dryer.\n\nI see two sets of shoes of seemingly identical function (comfortable hiking/walking shoes that aren't stupid bright and could sort of be used in a dressier outfit).  So leave one pair at home.  And you wear one pair while on the plane, right?  I get Merrell low-cut hiking shoes that come in all black if it's mostly a casual trip with the occasional need to look nicer.  If it's mostly a business/fancy trip but I want comfortable shoes for walking and hiking on established trails, then Merrell makes a very funtional slip-on in full-grain leather\\*.\n\n\\*Of course, if you're dressing up, all your leather items (shoes, belt, any gloves) should match.  All black.  Or all light brown.  Or all Codovan reddish brown, etc.\n\nRockport makes lace-up shoes that have light cushy soles and I find are fine for walking 10 miles around town on pavement but also fine with a nice outfit for sit-down restaurants or the symphony.\n\nYou can also look at shoes marketted to police and nurses.  Full-grain leather, but with support and cushioning for being on your feet all day.\n\nI see three pairs of pants (plus the pair you wear on the plane?!?) (plus the sweats plus shorts?!?).  I'd have at most two pair total - one I wear and one in my pack plus shorts that double as swim trunks (hotel pool, hot tub, hot day of walking).  For the two pair of long pants: the bottom, light, synthetic, dries-quickly pair you show.  And then either jeans, if it's that kind of trip, or slacks if it's a fancier or business conference trip.\n\nLooks like you're a brief-boxer guy.  Bikini briefs pack down a lot smaller.\n\nI'll set aside underwear and socks as they approach getting too hole-y to use anymore and take some on my next light-weight trip, discarding them in the hotel trash as I go, so I come back with a slightly smaller pack than I left with.  I'll occasionally retire button-down shirts like that, too, taking an old office shirt along and using it as a LS hiking shirt to keep the sun off and discarding it when I've finished my hiking.\n\nJapan uses US style electrical outlets and modern devices don't care that it's 100, not 120 volts.  SO no need for an adaptor.  \n\nI don't bring a heavy, metal water bottle, but a not-crinkly, nicer disposable pint water bottle like Dasani or Fiji.",

        "selftext": "We’re on our 10-day countdown to our 15-day trip to Japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto).\nWeather could be anywhere from 40°F to 70°F. We expect some rain and are prepared to buy an umbrella there.\n\nGENERAL ITINERARY:\nWe’re starting off with a few nights in Tokyo/Chiba for Star Wars Celebration (convention), then spending three nights in Osaka and Kyoto each, followed by three nights at Disneyland.\n\nThis is my final setup and my first time one-bagging a trip longer than a long weekend. Historically, I’ve always overpacked - options are fun and less decisions to make while packing ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  I’ve also realized I end up not wearing half of what I brought. This group has really inspired me! \n\nWe will be doing laundry as needed—handwashing and/or using hotel machines. Most of the clothes in my kit will be hand-washed. \n\nMy main bag is the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L. My daypack is the Cotopaxi Batac 16L, which will also serve as my personal item on the plane. The Batac will be tucked into the Allpa while commuting to/from airports, hotels, on trains, etc.\n\nA few things not shown: Apple Watch charger, a nice shirt for going out (either packing it or buying it in Japan), belt. I may pack a couple more socks and underwear. I’m also making a snack pack to bring along.\n\nI did a full pack including the clothes I’ll be wearing on the plane, just to see how it all feels and to make sure there’s extra room for shopping. So far I’m at 19.8 lbs.\n\nGEAR\nBag - Cotopaxi Allpa 42L\nDaypack - 16L Cotopaxi Batac\nGarment Folder - Eagle Creek (Large, without plastic folding insert)\nPacking Cube - 5L Cotopaxi (long/narrow)\nPacking Cubes - Set of 3 (might bring 1–2 for daypack or organizing souvenirs)\nToiletry Bag - Columbia Mazama Travel Kit (filled with all the usuals, tooth brush, deodorant, etc…)\n\n\nCLOTHING (including what I’ll be wearing on the plane)\nPants (1/2) - Ketl Shenanigan pants (grey)\nPants (1/2) - Still deciding between Mavi dark blue jeans (thin/stretchy) or Levi XX Chinos (both are in the photo, but only bringing 2 pants total)\nShirt (1/5) - 72-Hour Merino long sleeve\nShirt (1/5) - 72-Hour Merino polo\nShirts (3/5) - Unbound Merino crew T-shirts (black, charcoal, vintage indigo)\nShorts (1/2) - Fabletics One athletic shorts\nShorts (1/2) - Chubbies Everywhere Shorts\nSocks (1/3) - Darn Tough Light Hiker Lightweight Hiking Socks\nSocks (1/3) - Darn Tough Run Ultralightweight Socks\nSocks (1/3) - Darn Tough Light Hiker No Show Socks\nUndies (1/4) - Smartwool boxer brief\nUndies (3/4) - Under Armour Tech Boxer Briefs\nShoes (1/2) - Xero 360\nShoes (1/2) - Xero Ridgeway Mesh Low\nJacket (1) - Surprisingly packable bomber jacket (fits in 5L cube)\nRain Jacket (1) - Very lightweight Fabletics rain jacket\n\n\nGADGETS\niPad\niPhone\nFast charger plug with 2 USB-C ports\nUSB-B cable for AirPods\nCharging cables\nApple Watch\niPhone\nAirPods Pro\nSunglasses\nRegular glasses\nEarplugs\n\n\nOTHER\nLaundry detergent sheets\nEucalan wool detergent\nDisposable face masks\nHand sanitizer (will probably buy there)\nSnacks\nOwala water bottle\nGlasses case\n\n\nSTILL NEED\nTravel neck pillow – Any suggestions? So far the Ostrich Pillow and FLOWZOOM inflatable have been recommended by friends.\n\n\nThis group really has helped me put this kit together. Can’t wait to see what you all think. \n\n",

            "body": "Have a great trip!  If you set up works for you, it works for you.  But for me, I wouldn't bring 4 of the same kind t-shirt.  Two at most and a small container of any modern clothes detergent like Tide HE to wash clothes in the hotel sink or wastebasket, press between bath towels, hung to dry overnight and if needed (or you're in a hurry) with the hotel hair dryer.\n\nI see two sets of shoes of seemingly identical function (comfortable hiking/walking shoes that aren't stupid bright and could sort of be used in a dressier outfit).  So leave one pair at home.  And you wear one pair while on the plane, right?  I get Merrell low-cut hiking shoes that come in all black if it's mostly a casual trip with the occasional need to look nicer.  If it's mostly a business/fancy trip but I want comfortable shoes for walking and hiking on established trails, then Merrell makes a very funtional slip-on in full-grain leather\\*.\n\n\\*Of course, if you're dressing up, all your leather items (shoes, belt, any gloves) should match.  All black.  Or all light brown.  Or all Codovan reddish brown, etc.\n\nRockport makes lace-up shoes that have light cushy soles and I find are fine for walking 10 miles around town on pavement but also fine with a nice outfit for sit-down restaurants or the symphony.\n\nYou can also look at shoes marketted to police and nurses.  Full-grain leather, but with support and cushioning for being on your feet all day.\n\nI see three pairs of pants (plus the pair you wear on the plane?!?) (plus the sweats plus shorts?!?).  I'd have at most two pair total - one I wear and one in my pack plus shorts that double as swim trunks (hotel pool, hot tub, hot day of walking).  For the two pair of long pants: the bottom, light, synthetic, dries-quickly pair you show.  And then either jeans, if it's that kind of trip, or slacks if it's a fancier or business conference trip.\n\nLooks like you're a brief-boxer guy.  Bikini briefs pack down a lot smaller.\n\nI'll set aside underwear and socks as they approach getting too hole-y to use anymore and take some on my next light-weight trip, discarding them in the hotel trash as I go, so I come back with a slightly smaller pack than I left with.  I'll occasionally retire button-down shirts like that, too, taking an old office shirt along and using it as a LS hiking shirt to keep the sun off and discarding it when I've finished my hiking.\n\nJapan uses US style electrical outlets and modern devices don't care that it's 100, not 120 volts.  SO no need for an adaptor.  \n\nI don't bring a heavy, metal water bottle, but a not-crinkly, nicer disposable pint water bottle like Dasani or Fiji.",

As a result, there is now a vertical air channel on back padding\n* Changed: Vinyl coating feels much less rubbery than on the old version. I like the new coating better.\n* Removed: There is no more side access to the main compartment (see picture)\n* Changed(?): The water bottle pocket mesh seems a bit stretchier, so may fit a larger bottle\n* Changed: MSRP is now $250\n\nGenerally, I like the changes, except for the price increase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hghpmz868qfd1.jpeg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d750a38838614ec161d1c1be96dbea9c4e572e70",

I was testing the bag earlier this week with ebags cubes, but I really like this setup. \n\nSpectre Clean/Dirty medium - I can easily fit board shorts and 4-5 t-shirts (folded once, in half). This will be great for cutting down on wrinkles. It'll be nice to have a built in compartment for separating dirty clothes\n\nSpectre tech Medium - I wanted to get one compression cube for the bag I'll have pants and long sleeve shirts in. Saves some space - I've got two long sleeve shirts and two pairs of pants in here. Probably won't bring two shirts. But I gotta have my white linen lounge pants, because I'll be living in Sri Lanka until April ;)\n\nPack it original Slim - I probably would have gotten the Spectre slim to save weight, but the store gave me this one for free. Turns out they don't stock it anymore and had written \"display only\" in sharpie on the back of it lol. Good for my underwear and socks, and fits snugly in the middle.\n\n\nPretty happy with my load out, there's definitely some wiggle room in the main compartment, and plenty of space elsewhere in this bag. \n\nYou can check out my last test pack run with pictures here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/ej8fi3/cotopaxi_allpa_42l_test_pack_w_ebags_packing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share",

Travel backpacks like the Cotopaxi (unlike most normal backpacks) have a clamshell opening like traditional suitcase luggage that makes organization in and access to the storage compartment super simple. This is important in order to compact items and optimize space.\n\nFor duffel bags, a U-Shaped zipper opening can improve access to the internal compartment. The OGIO has a straight zipper, though, and from my experience this is super painful to use especially for travel where organization is super important. I personally avoid duffels with straight zippers entirely. \n\nWith that said, I commend you for finding a bag with the right dimensions and at such a low price!
