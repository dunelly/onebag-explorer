            "body": "I went to Montreal to snowboard for three days this past weekend and wanted to pack everything I needed in one bag (although snowboard gears have to be in a separate bag). I used to toss everything in a couple of duffle bags and that worked, but this time I found a cheap flight out of Montreal so I wanted to see if my new backpack would work for air travel. Long story short, I ended up driving so I couldn't test it. But as for having one bag to travel with, this backpack served its purpose very well.\n\nI have been looking for one backpack that can be an EDC as well as a travel backpack. While Shimoda Explore V2 30 is a camera backpack, it doesn't have to be just a camera backpack and has almost everything I wanted out of a backpack from the reviews I read/watched and also was made with air travel in mind so I committed to buy. They don't ship to Canada so I used B&amp;H (free shipping to Canada but have to pay taxes) to import. I didn't buy the camera insert as I figured I would just toss my mirrorless Sony in the top compartment if I do decide to travel with it.\n\nI fit everything you see in the picture in the backpack. I packed snowboard pants + fleece top + snowboard jacket in the backpack and that was occupying most of the volume (about 60% of the backpack). I think I could have maybe sacrificed a t-shirt to make a room for a Nintendo Switch or something in the future. It is definitely viable to use this backpack for a weekend trip, maybe even for a week or two depending on how you pack.\n\nI also packed my go-to Xiaomi sling bag that I got from Ali Express for $20ish in the backpack. I could carry hot coffee and some snack (among other things) in that bag up the mountain and it's small enough so it doesn't get in the way and it's perfect. When I travel I can usually carry my camera, wallet, water bottle, etc in that sling bag as well. Rather comfortable and well made for the price.\n\nI didn't bring a laptop this time but I also wanted to make sure that I could carry my work laptop in this backpack when I bought this. I have a HP Elitebook 850 G6 (15.6\") as my work laptop and it does fit but very snugly so you won't be able to put that in with one hand or pull it out through the back panel. I think that would be the maximum size of laptop that this backpack can fit. Anything 13-14\" should be no problem at all.\n\nMost of the online reviews mention this but I just wanna comment on how comfortable this backpack is. It was 7kg when I finished packing (so I could use it as a carry-on on the low cost plane) and it definitely carries easier than other backpacks I've had in the past and that is without the included hip belt. Solid and thoughtful construction, enough pockets for charging wires and tech stuff (not pictured), great material and overall very happy with it. I am looking forward to travel with this backpack in the future now.",

            "body": "\"My partner is very short &amp; petite (4'10\"\" / 147cm). Finding proper equipment, clothing or gear etc of any kind has always been a struggle.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# [Peak Design 15L everyday zip backpack](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip) (old setup)\n\nPast few years they been traveling/hiking around with this. To many it is dinky small but for them it fits nicely. Even fits under airlines seats. Despite the size it is able to fit both a [Sony 200-600 &amp; 70-200](https://i.imgur.com/WcIdoNh.jpg) snugly including body! We have an extended eyecup which[ barely touches the top edge](https://i.imgur.com/mvcbKB2.jpg) but zips up fine. \n\nHowever the shoulder straps kinda suck. Especially with this much glass &amp; lugging around for many hours. PD says over time it will soften &amp; break-in. It does, but only little bit. We almost considered cutting it off and sewing something else on. Understandably it doesn't have a hipbelt for such a small bag, but to the petite it is normal size. Would have offloaded a good amount of weight from the shoulders with one. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#[Explore v2 25 Women's Starter Kit \\(teal\\)](https://shimodadesigns.com/explore-v2-25-womens-starter-kit-w-small-mirrorless-core-unit-teal/) (upgrade setup)\n\nIn search of a better more comfortable bag this landed in our crosshair. It was almost perfect. Fits under airlines seats. Product spec is 25L but dimensions actually come out to 21.34L so pretty small still which is good. Bit bigger than the PD which gives more room for misc items. Has new women specific shoulder straps, hip belt &amp; torso length is adjustable. There are other women specific straps available sold separately. Don't think any other camera backpack does this. Fits very well for petite people.\n\nComes default with a small mirrorless core unit. Sold separately their [large mirrorless core unit](https://shimodadesigns.com/core-unit-large-mirrorless/) cubes fits the length of a 200-600 lens + body as shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7DfvDqgMK8). Product page *explicitly* states in the description it will not fit in a 25L model bag. Only 30L or larger. However... this [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYZMzkF95qk) said it would fit but tight. \n\nSure enough it was [pretty tight fitting](https://i.imgur.com/bUPH0FE.jpg). There was no way you can insert the cube from the normal rear panel opening. Only way was to remove the top zippered pouch and insert from there. The core unit will take up almost the entire cavity of the bag. You lose the ability to quickly remove the core unit but some compromise had to be accepted. There is a tiny curved space at the top just enough to fit a pair of gloves. \n\nRoomy enough for both [200-600 + 70-200](https://i.imgur.com/85Vijz9.jpg) plus body. Because our [extended eyecup protrudes longer than the core unit](https://i.imgur.com/xJDqRFc.jpg) cube we had to remove it when placing inside or risk deforming/breaking. Alternatively a [pelican 1500 divider](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1715112-REG/a_mode_limited_in1500_divider_set_for_pelican.html) would also fit inside. It would be 1 inch longer to accommodate our extended eyecup but the dividers are 1inch shorter depth &amp; no wireframe to give extra bag support. \n\nFits under [airline seats](https://i.imgur.com/K1rj2jk.jpeg). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Comparing size \n\n* [Side view](https://i.imgur.com/fiWj3XB.jpg)\n* [Front view](https://i.imgur.com/J6tKliG.jpg)\n* [Back view](https://i.imgur.com/EDdGCg6.jpg)\n\nHope this helps anyone else that is small &amp; petite.",

I received a lot of recommendations, but the one I settled on was peakdesign everyday 30L bag in their new X-Pac material colorway. I got a Techpouch to go with it since I have lots of cables, adapters and small items I need for those devices.\n\nI needed to be able to carry a switch, a steamdeck, headphones, viture XR pro glasses, viture neckband, controllers, headphones, powerbank, power adapters, cables, laptop, mouse, and tablet. That's a lot of stuff and I also wanted it to be easy access so i can pull anything out quickly and put it away quickly without fumbling through layers of a bag. These side doors were perfect on this bag.\n\nI grabbed an extra divider off their site so I can create more layers.\n\n  \nHere are some pics of how I got the inside electronics layered in.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/uRupPut.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/uRupPut.jpeg)\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/jFgZpBi.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/jFgZpBi.jpeg)\n\nThis is the tech pouch from outside\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/CIGhgKL.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/CIGhgKL.jpeg)\n\nThe Coyote Xpac colorway is very dark dijon mustard colored in dim lighting, but when you're outside it turns into a gold color due to the shiny surface. The X-Pac material seems like it will hold up well (I have an X Pac pack from Aer so I knew I already wanted this material type from peakdesign)\n\nThanks again for all your suggestions and also for leading me to a good fit I was looking for",
