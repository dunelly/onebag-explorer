An admin panel with many pockets, a spacious main compartment with another pocket, and a sunglasses pocket. You can make a luggage pass through sleeve with its external lash points with a sling. I love its minimalist style and leather accents, all for 2 lbs. Be forewarned that the G-1000 material carries the marks of your journey and pet hair. \n\nThe bellroy: • Honestly, being 24 liters would make it the best size for both everyday use AND travel. These ones I like around 24 to 28 L, my typical everyday carry is 20 L (Fjallraven Raven). But the thing that’s going to vary the most is the comfortability of it because some people say that the straps are too thin.\n\nFjallraven Skule and Patagonia Refugio: \n• are more hiking/outdoorsy type backpacks, with the elastic cords and the material. The Refugio has a separate laptop zipper at least but idk about Skule laptop, edit the Skule has the laptop sleeve in the main compartment. Also the Refugio 30L is too much for an everyday backpack. \n\nThe Victorinox may be the best if you want 32L for an everyday and travel companion because it has the luggage pass through and is the most subtle of them. \n\nLulumelon: I do not know about that bag.",

        "selftext": "Hey there,\nI wanted to share my very first pack list. I’ve been a lurker for some time, just to do research on gear. For my 16 day Japan trip (Tokyo - Hakone - Takayama - Kyoto - Osaka) I will travel the 6-day Hakone - Takayama - Kyoto leg just with my backpack. My checked luggage will be forwarded from Tokyo and awaits me in Tokyo. I struggle to stay below the 6-7kg threshold for carry-on luggage and prefer to travel with checked luggage for room for gifts and shopping. \n\nI will not do any laundry fyi:\n\n-6 T-shirts, underwear and pairs of socks \n-Uniqlo blocktech parka\n-2 pairs of trousers + one I’m wearing\n-2 jumpers + one I’m wearing\n-iPad, tech pouch with charger and cables\n-AirPods Max and Pro, Sleepbuds\n-Kindle is in the photo but I put it in my checked luggage. I didn’t do any reading due to exhaustion and being busy with exploring the city\n-toiletry bag with Philips one toothbrush (I have a larger toiletry bag in my checked luggage and pull out this smaller bag with essentials for cabin usually)\n-water bottle\n-camera cube (T5, 23/2, 27/2.8, 35/1.4) my cube is heavy and takes up a lot of space. In the future I’ll consider getting a smaller cube for one body + lens or even downgrade to an X100. I do love 40mm equivalent though\n\nThe backpack weighs around 9.5kg. Thanks for reading and you guys have a lovely community here!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ovvj1x/bellroy_classic_backpack_plus_v2_vs_v1_all/",
        "selftext": "Having owned Bellroy Classic Backpack Plus (black) for a couple of years and mostly using the backpack as my daily office bag (spare the pandemic time of course), could not resist getting a v2 version of it in a \"ranger green\". Here is an outline of all changes that I was able to spot.\n\n# Exterior / overall construction\n\n* The v2 pack is spec'ed to be 50gr lighter than v1.\n* The v2 pack is spec'ed at 24l vs 22l for v1. I can't tell if there is really a difference in volume.\n* My particular \"ranger green\" color fabric feels just a bit more \"plasticky\" than the one on the black one, but I like it overall. The color is actually slightly darker than on the photos.\n\n[v1 on the left, v2 on the right](https://preview.redd.it/khboyg1osre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8db946d2abed322b1aa86eebcfeb2aa73e63b08d)\n\n* The bottom lost a hard line around it, became smoother with the front. Still does not stand, but better looking IMHO.\n\n[Bottom does not have a hard line around it](https://preview.redd.it/zdpm00opsre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16be063d5cd1e3d2658b8a5e499f1bd2fc7f9699)\n\n* All zip pullers are bigger and more rigid.\n* Back padding became more rigid and has a divider split for ventilation. Can't really say if lumbar support became anymore comfortable since I did not notice any effect from it it on the v1 either.\n\n[Back padding](https://preview.redd.it/3pa2ltuvsre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=896078e7ac6fbe7a1a5a5069b0fec70d23f64a27)\n\n* Slightly different construction of sternum strap attachment points.\n* Added subtle Bellroy logo on the left shoulder strap.\n* Straps have thicker and more rigid padding.\n* All horizontal zippers changed direction. They are opening right to left in v1 and left to right in v2.\n\n# Interior / pockets\n\n* Front pocket space expanded to the right of the zipper, creating a bit of extra space. Keychain ring lash became longer too.\n\n[More space in the front pocket](https://preview.redd.it/0ixmclvqtre71.jpg?width=1535&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec4163a3ddaf5841430550dfa21acd6d49d0418e)\n\n* Sunglasses pocket zipper got a long zipper puller,  it is much easier to open it than in v1 (unless you added an extended pull to v1's zipper yourself of course).\n* The same sunglasses pocket got a soft lining, instead of just a thin stretchy mesh in v1.\n\n[Sunglasses pocket with a soft lining and a longer zipper puller](https://preview.redd.it/4si7qpyytre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9a2e3d18fef14f92e84a11705fab0b46c2e7546)\n\n* Interior lost water bottle pocket (was not usable anyways IMHO) and got papers (business papers, man) compartment. The papers compartment is rigid, not stretchy.\n\n[Swap of a water bottle pocket with papers section](https://preview.redd.it/72vnk3jeure71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e999639ea2c2361fe65b04ffcf88b2ce89d7fba)\n\n* Interior pocket became smaller in length but wider at the top, all its surface is fronted by the mesh/stretchy material (in v1 there was a part of the pocket going below the mesh/stretchy area). It also got hi-viz internal lining.\n* In the v1 there is an issue, when you open up a main compartment, due to the way front panel folded it created a \"fold\"/\"bottleneck\" between upper part of the compartment and a bottom one, this reduced visibility and access into the bottom part of the main section.  Due to new bottom/front panel construction it is mostly gone now.\n\n[Harder line in the middle of v1 created main compartment visibility issues](https://preview.redd.it/itgz8q9ktre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b345305444f0e26d26c28411ab02ab28216c6ebe)\n\n* The laptop compartment itself did not change, but its accessory pocket did. No more meshed zipped pocket, a rigid \"flap panel\" pocket instead of it. Because the pocket is so high to the zipper of the laptop compartment itself I think it is as secure as the zipped one, but now access to it is much faster as you don't have to unzip yet another pocket.\n\n[Zip pocket on v1 vs flap panel pocket on v2](https://preview.redd.it/rlyle021vre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=232f1aeb3222f41b21d2d290b6df54f471e815b9)\n\n* This pocket also has hi-viz internal lining.\n\n[Hi-viz internal lining helps finding things faster](https://preview.redd.it/2wxop5f2vre71.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54c5e2307ba2002124b42b611e7358beb7278f65)\n\nAll in all I loved pretty much every change to the bag, which fixed some of my griefs with v1 and improved some of the others I was not aware needed an improvement :) It is really a well thought through evolution of v1, not a revolution. Will be keeping it as my daily bag.\n\nIf you have any specific questions - let me know, happy to answer them.\n\nIf you would like to buy my v1 for 50% of what they ask on [bellroy.com](https://bellroy.com) for it - feel free to DM me.",

            "body": "I was actually facing a similar decision not long ago (Bellroy Classic Backpack Plus vs. Aer Tech Pack) and I eventually decided to go with the Bellroy. So far (2 weeks in), I do love the bag, although there are a few things I wish could be improved.\n\nPros:\n\n* Design: The Bellroy is absolutely stunning; I love the unique shape and minimalism, and it definitely wouldn't look out of place with a suit or in an office environment. In fact, the 2 exterior quick-access pockets blend in with the design and the zippers are hidden, so you can't even tell that these pockets exist (good for theft-proofing).\n* High quality, water-resistant materials: the venture-weave polyester feels really nice to the touch, and I've walked through heavy rain with the interior remaining completely dry.\n* Thoughtful organization; I find the Aer to have way too many organizational slots that take up unnecessary space, while Bellroy has the perfect amount of pockets and organization. 2 exterior pockets (one for phone/wallet, another for keys/earbuds/accessories), a pocket in the main compartment for a notebook/small book, and my favourite: a pocket on the top of the laptop compartment that stores a charger/mouse/other accessories and that doesn't intrude into the main compartment (seriously, why don't more bag manufacturers do this?)\n* Holds its shape: the Bellroy holds its shape when it's empty (it doesn't slouch), and it never looks bulky even when stuffed to the brim. It can even comfortably stand up on its own if it's more than 80% filled.\n* Comfort: the straps and the back panel are very nicely padded, and the lumbar support (basically a bulge near the lower spine area) actually helps a lot with comfort when walking with the bag over extended distances.\n\nCons:\n\n* Weight: this is by far the biggest problem for me. The Bellroy is pretty heavy even when completely empty, although the comfort does somewhat make up for it.\n* Lack of exterior water bottle pocket; I do understand why Bellroy decided not to include it (it interferes with the minimalist design), but I'm constantly paranoid that my water bottle would leak so I'm hesitant to keep it in the interior water bottle pocket.\n* Lack of pen slot/document sleeve: it's not a problem for me (I carry around a pen case and notebook all the time), but it's something to note if you're expecting one.\n* Size: It's slightly too big for my daily EDC needs (a laptop, notebook, book, pens, water bottle, and various small tech accessories) although the extra space does come in handy when I occasionally need to bring a change of clothes for workouts.\n\nIf I were to choose now, I would probably go with the normal Bellroy Classic, which has most of the features and organization of the Plus but a slightly smaller size; the Brown Buffalo Conceal is another good option to consider. I don't like the Aer mainly because of how the outside material doesn't keep its shape if you're stuffing it (the glossy finish makes it even more obvious if there are objects protruding against it), but that's just my opinion and I've seen many others enjoy the bag. Overall, if you really want simple but effective organization, a sleek aesthetic, and you're OK with extra weight and size, then I would 100% recommend the Bellroy Classic Plus.",

I carry everything in my backpack into my clinic and office areas, then if I’m lucky with a lunch break, I take the sling with me to grab coffee or go on a quick walk. That allows me to carry my badge, keys, AirPods, phone, and sometimes a book with me without the “bigness” of the backpack for what’s usually a pretty quick jaunt outside. On the weekends, that little green pouch gets tucked away, and I use the backpack for daily carry. I have been LOVING this setup so far!!!",

Could be used in a professional environment as well as a carry along/personal carry.\nCapacity seems fine, since there are not a lot of pockets....you can just throw stuff around, Accessible with clam(half)opening.\nThe front easy access pocket has a dimension of its own..can store a lot.\nMain pocket feels great and premium. Will not recommend for any wet/liquid stuff and has enough organization.\n\nCons.\nLack of Organization in the front pocket, though the top pocket meant for glasses can be used for smaller items, earphones/gum/change.\n\nComfort - the strap and back pannel, are soft, cushiony and high qulaity.\nWith heavier loads it will not be super comfortable, No sternum strap.\n\nAdditinal thoughts:\nThe bag is not dedicated to any particular use case, there are better workbags, better carry ons, better bags for city walks, better edc or weekend bags.\nThe classic is versatlile enough for all of those...jack of all...a Classic Backpack in all sense.\n\nVerdict : go for it, if you are looking for something simple and premium. Won't regret it.",

            "body": "First Impressions\n\nColor:\n\nI did not like my color choice out of the box. Deep plum was the only color way of the premium edition I was okay with though. After a few days use I got used to the color and actually enjoy it now, although the blue straps really don't fit in and I wish they were different.\n\nQuality:\n\nOne of my huge pet peeves with bags is the use of low quality materials or bad textures. I stay away from TimBuk2 simply because of how their bags feel. This bag has an interesting grid texture thats actually made from water bottles, it feels very durable on the outside and very soft and smooth on the inside. The leather on the bottom feels okay, I have no experience with leather and didn't look into the material too much. I just really like having a layer of protection on the bottom to prevent liquids from seeping in.\n\nComfort:\n\nThe mesh back in very well done and is super comfortable. The straps however, feel too short. I'm not tall - 5'8\" - and still the straps feel like they should be slightly longer. On the contrary however, when I loosen the straps the bottom of the bag drags on my lower back. Something just feels off. This isn't a dealbreaker, and the bag is still very much wearable even fully loaded, but it felt like something to note.\n\nCapacity:\n\nThis easily fits my M1 Air, notebook, Kindle, a change of clothes/jacket, and a water bottle. I bought this bag specifically because I wanted something small for EDC and this fits that bill.\n\nQuick Notes:\n\n* The outer material scuffs really easily (as seen in the first picture) \n* The front quick access pocket folds over the leather and has it's own material which makes loading it up not take up internal space\n* It does not stand on it's own\n\nOverall this is my new EDC outside of work for the time being. I've seen the bad things about Bellroy recently and it really concerned me since I had already ordered my bag, but personally I've only had one interaction with support and it was good. I asked for a color change since I accidentally ordered the black variant and they helped me in under 24 hours.",
