I LOVE this little guy. I can fit my 1L water bottle or my mirrorless camera in here, which makes it a great roadtripping/adventure buddy.\n\nBlue/orange Patagonia Arbor pack (XL? Probably 32L.) Bought it secondhand and haven't been able to find much info about this one. I really wanted to like this pack, but the shoulder straps feel like my cheapo school backpacks in the 90s.\n\nGray Osprey Talon (22L). The comfiest backpack I've ever had. If I'm doing a serious dayhike, this is the bag I'm taking. It's one of those that you forget you're wearing.\n\n**Second Row Up:**\n\nGreen REI Big Haul duffel (90L). Super heavy duty duffel with a neat look. I mainly use it to pack up my clothes when I move.\n\nGray Patagonia Black Hole Cube (6L). My main toiletry bag, which I pretty much live out of.\n\nSmall black Ikea pouch (fits inside main toiletry bag)\n\nBlue Harry's toiletry bag from Target (used as makeup bag)\n\nREI Roadtripper Pouch\n\nOrange REI Flash Pack 18: super lightweight and folds down small/flat for packing. Still pretty comfy as long as it's not overloaded.\n\nPacking Cubes: medium Eagle Creek with clean/dirty sides + a cheapo Ikea cube.\n\nBlue Osprey Ultralight Waistpack\n\nFruit-print Lily Bloom weekender bag. Bought this one secondhand and don't know anything about the brand.\n\n**Third Row Up:**\n\nGreenish Patagonia Black Hole duffel (40L): This one is supposed to fold into its own pocket, but I could not get it to work. Otherwise excellent and VERY sturdy bag.\n\nBlack Kelty Redwing Tactical pack (30L): Really comfy, spacious, and veryyy sturdy.\n\nGray/Gold Osprey Daylite Tote-Pack (20L): has backpack straps that hide away. This is my absolute favorite bag right now. I really love its versatility!\n\nBasic bowling ball bag from Bowling.com\n\n**Top Row:**\n\nBasic Adidas gym bag. I didn't need this. I had a brief gym phase, ugh\n\nOrange REI Ruckpack (28L). I envision using this as a very minimalist travel bag in the future. I haven't had much of a chance to use it yet, but I love the look and it's very comfy to wear. Also comes with a built-in raincover, which is awesome.\n\nGreen Kelty Redwing (44L). This is my wilderness backpack. I switched from a 50L Osprey and like this one WAY more. It's light, very comfy to wear when loaded up, unzips super wide, and has great organization.\n\nDisneyland Starbucks tote: where I store my hats and stuff\n\nREI Roadtripper duffel: using this as storage for work uniforms. Folds down into its pocket and has a shoulder strap, but overall just your basic duffel.\n\nDarcy Marks leather purse: Was gifted this one and am not familiar with the brand.\n\n**Questions welcome!**",

I LOVE this little guy. I can fit my 1L water bottle or my mirrorless camera in here, which makes it a great roadtripping/adventure buddy.\n\nBlue/orange Patagonia Arbor pack (XL? Probably 32L.) Bought it secondhand and haven't been able to find much info about this one. I really wanted to like this pack, but the shoulder straps feel like my cheapo school backpacks in the 90s.\n\nGray Osprey Talon (22L). The comfiest backpack I've ever had. If I'm doing a serious dayhike, this is the bag I'm taking. It's one of those that you forget you're wearing.\n\n**Second Row Up:**\n\nGreen REI Big Haul duffel (90L). Super heavy duty duffel with a neat look. I mainly use it to pack up my clothes when I move.\n\nGray Patagonia Black Hole Cube (6L). My main toiletry bag, which I pretty much live out of.\n\nSmall black Ikea pouch (fits inside main toiletry bag)\n\nBlue Harry's toiletry bag from Target (used as makeup bag)\n\nREI Roadtripper Pouch\n\nOrange REI Flash Pack 18: super lightweight and folds down small/flat for packing. Still pretty comfy as long as it's not overloaded.\n\nPacking Cubes: medium Eagle Creek with clean/dirty sides + a cheapo Ikea cube.\n\nBlue Osprey Ultralight Waistpack\n\nFruit-print Lily Bloom weekender bag. Bought this one secondhand and don't know anything about the brand.\n\n**Third Row Up:**\n\nGreenish Patagonia Black Hole duffel (40L): This one is supposed to fold into its own pocket, but I could not get it to work. Otherwise excellent and VERY sturdy bag.\n\nBlack Kelty Redwing Tactical pack (30L): Really comfy, spacious, and veryyy sturdy.\n\nGray/Gold Osprey Daylite Tote-Pack (20L): has backpack straps that hide away. This is my absolute favorite bag right now. I really love its versatility!\n\nBasic bowling ball bag from Bowling.com\n\n**Top Row:**\n\nBasic Adidas gym bag. I didn't need this. I had a brief gym phase, ugh\n\nOrange REI Ruckpack (28L). I envision using this as a very minimalist travel bag in the future. I haven't had much of a chance to use it yet, but I love the look and it's very comfy to wear. Also comes with a built-in raincover, which is awesome.\n\nGreen Kelty Redwing (44L). This is my wilderness backpack. I switched from a 50L Osprey and like this one WAY more. It's light, very comfy to wear when loaded up, unzips super wide, and has great organization.\n\nDisneyland Starbucks tote: where I store my hats and stuff\n\nREI Roadtripper duffel: using this as storage for work uniforms. Folds down into its pocket and has a shoulder strap, but overall just your basic duffel.\n\nDarcy Marks leather purse: Was gifted this one and am not familiar with the brand.\n\n**Questions welcome!**",

I need to choose it without being there as I’m meeting my friend at a conference and she will bring one for me to bring home. I’ve tried the REI Trail 25 on in-store and found it incredibly comfortable. I’m worried it’s a bit delicate and not waterproof enough for living in the rainy Northwest of Lancaster/Cumbria. The Gregory Resin looks a little “smarter” for going to conferences and is more likely to help me out in rain. Because I’ve one-bagged with as much as 20 lbs that needs to be taken into account as well (also need to just carry less). \n\nCrucial to me is the sternum strap, some back/shoulder paddding on straps etc, a water bottle pocket, and a large main compartment to take packing cubes/bags. My usual bag is a black Osprey Porter 30 but it’s too “cinched down” for every day use and no water bottle pocket. It also looks too big on some of the airlines I’ve brought it as my personal bag.",

Never check the water-resistance, mainly because I never use it for anything that’s critical for staying dry. I’d say just use a plastic liner if you’re worried about it. \n\nEither way, great bag.

I tried the 26 as well and it was a bit too big (stuck out from my back too far). I like using the Resin 24 since I can pull out my packing cubes and use it as a daypack when I reach my destination. Main compartment is huge and just a giant bucket so you can fit a lot in there! The exterior is very durable and water resistant (haven't tried it in a downpour, but it's fine for drizzles I'd imagine). Fits under the seat of any airline I've tried.\n\nIt's very comfortable for regular usage and walking around (10 mile days, including many miles fully packed on the way to/from the airport). Wasn't as comfortable to use when biking, but I didn't get it for that purpose. The back panel has ventilation so my back stayed dry. It fits under the seat on airlines and the way it zips up with the gussets helps compress your stuff even more. I've taken it to Alaska, Michigan, and Minneapolis so far. Haven't tried the Trail 25, but the Resin 24 checked all of my marks!\n\nOne note is that I don't usually bring a laptop, so I wanted a bag with minimal laptop space but that still had a compartment just in case. With a laptop it would get a bit more snug inside but the laptop would be right next to your back which is nice for weight distribution. Good luck!",

        "selftext": "[https://www.rei.com/product/168496/rei-co-op-beyonder-pack](https://www.rei.com/product/168496/rei-co-op-beyonder-pack)\n\nI can't seem to find any reviews of this pack - is it a brand new release?\n\nIt looks to me like an REI Flash 22 (liter), just bigger (30L), less choices for places to lash things to, no side straps to compress the bag, heavier fabric, laptop compartment, and with a full-length side zip.\n\nI like the REI Ruckpack 28 for all the side pockets and organization, but I vastly, vastly prefer a drawstring main opening with a top compartment that lays over and covers it, just like this REI Beyonder 30 Pack has.\n\nThis is my old REI Flash 22\n\n\\- Because the top compartment can be cinched down like a lid (versus zipped shut like in the Ruckpack), you're able to strap a lot of extra stuff quickly and easily while still having access to the zippered top compartment. I can't tell you how many times this has saved my ass - if I have wet clothes or a towel that hasn't completely dried, I can simply strap it down underneath the top compartment. It's secured, doesn't drag below the bag, and the wet stuff is able to slowly dry. There have been many times I've been inside a public bathroom with only one hook for hanging something, but I have my bag and wet clothes that I need to hang somewhere - this completely solves the problem.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g55y8ox6gpa41.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b06a8cb5622888f060c1ade56160ad6680a3530\n\n\\- A drawcord opening is more flexible and simple than a zippered opening. I can put irregular-shaped objects in the collar and the drawcord just conforms to it. I've put a DSLR with lens attached at the top of the opening and the drawcord doesn't care and simply lashes shut in a way that conforms to the shape of the camera.\n\n\\- A drawcord opening's collar can add a tiny bit more volume to the pack.\n\n\\- Drawcords are very simple to repair and arguably faster to open and close than a zipper\n\nSo... thoughts on the REI Beyonder Pack?",

The removable roll top pouches they talk about are in the photos on the website - they're just separate storage pouches that come with the bag. \n\nThey operate by pinching the opening closed and then rolling them down and clipping them shut with buckles. The rolling operation is exactly like a standard dry bag:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qYi8YCFjM24\n\nThere are also straps at the sides of the bags that you can cinch to compress down the contents of the bag.\n\nI personally love this roll+strap method because it naturally compresses the contents of the bag, pushes out any excess air, saving on space, and the final size of the bag conforms to its contents - there isn't any loose floppy fabric. It's also simpler and more robust than zippers, although the roll top bags that come with this REI bag seem to have a bottom zipper on them for additional ease of access.",

        "selftext": "Hello r/onebag! I recently made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1dxqbiv/aer_travel_pack_3_xpac_long_term_review/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) about my Aer TP3 and some alternatives I have been considering, one of them being the updated REI Ruckpack 40L ([this thing](https://www.rei.com/product/235558/rei-co-op-ruckpack-40-pack-mens)). Making this post to provide some information and pictures since it's new and, at the time of writing this, not yet in stores for people to try out.\n\n# Impressions\n\nFor reference, I shop at REI a lot, but the only other bag I own is an older version of their Flash 22. I view REI branded gear much like I view the Kirkland brand from Costco: reliable, solid, nothing flashy. I think this bag lines up with those expectations. Just like in my other review, I'll skip over the specs since that information is online. Here are some scattered thoughts:\n\n* I got the iron oxide color and it looks darker than it does on the website. Definitely reminds me of rust, while the website looks almost \\_red\\_.\n* Harness system feels good. I loaded up my bag and moved around the house for about 30 min and didn't feel fatigued. Certainly not as good as TP3's harness system, but that's totally fine for my use case.\n* There are some additional mesh compartments inside the main bucket that give just enough organization for random knick knacks. I attached some pictures of it since it's not shown on the website listing.\n\nOverall, I'm liking the bag, since the main thing I'm looking for is a ginormous bucket. Leave any questions below and I'll try to answer them.\n\n[Darker red than what I see on the website](https://preview.redd.it/3ct5vwsa7ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596b95d74911f4903973a23dc01b796cd60f49ef)\n\n[Top flap pocket not shown on listing](https://preview.redd.it/6mq03gcb7ebd1.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70fac7bbf0bf59a064f2a04ceefe8f07f4c0d189)\n\n[Big main bucket, 3.5L Bellroy Toiletry Kit Plus for reference](https://preview.redd.it/524nw6yb7ebd1.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e09301cfc5ebeb082260022c2e2b0b3b26a4daf9)\n\n[Mesh pockets](https://preview.redd.it/xnazhfhc7ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=095bf3e76741762108e1098ff8212dda59e40606)\n\n[3.5L + 13L + 4.5L cubes](https://preview.redd.it/nnkzaj4d7ebd1.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89ad36cfd834f388e8ba5fe8a4d125a9fa2a67b)\n\n[After zipping up, depth-wise, there is still enough space to shove a pair of shoes or Sony XM5 headphones case like I did](https://preview.redd.it/ev00h0ud7ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd1596ecce68baae8a2118f426a2fd70856f2c4b)\n\n[What the harness system looks like zipped up](https://preview.redd.it/w6hbhgl98ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91d935cbeb91416e032578fbd2afa728be3435ef)\n\n",

        "selftext": "I’m not a true one-bagger since I bring along a carryon bag and a personal item backpack. For years I had been carrying a basic Timbuk2 18-20L backpack but recently upgraded to this REI 28L bag, women’s size (half off from the recent sale). \n\nI just took it on a domestic trip and loved it. The reason I wanted a new bag (I’m a buy it for life kind of person) was because the older bag was just slightly too small to accommodate shifting packing when I would buy anything on a trip and it was getting uncomfortable because it didn’t have any real additional support (like chest or waist strap). This bag had just enough organizational pockets, one of them being the top pocket which was so easy to grab stuff from when the bag was stowed beneath the seat during the flight. I’m not tall, less than 5’2”, so it wasn’t in my way when tucked in the seat in front of me. I read older reviews of the bag that said the laptop sleeve went all the way to the bottom so your computer would hit the floor but it’s been changed and there are a couple inch gap. The top strap can also be used as a carryon pass through strap! \n\nOverall, happy with this upgrade (especially since I got a great deal on it). Can’t wait to take it on an international trip! ",
