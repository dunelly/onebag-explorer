While I absolutely love my v3 CPL24 - maybe the most versatile bag I've ever owned, and I've traveled extensively with it - I have been hoping EG would release a smaller, more active-oriented EDC pack that could combine as my EDC/grab-and-go camera system - and preferably not in black. Cue the MPL22 in Coyote Ecopak ... wow, I could not be happier with this system. Cheers!",

I'm coming from a Kipling Seoul Large and used it mainly for travel so l'm looking to size up a little bit, have an external laptop pocket, and smaller internal pockets. Most importantly, I wish for it to not be ugly. I would size up to the Seoul XL but they are all ugly at the moment and I don't think they pack super well (l find the zipper opens too easily). I'm open to any recommendations but north face (I hate north face— for valid reason, they don't hold a lot and I find they feel incredibly heavy for no reason).\n\nIf it helps, I am a working grad student and will be a student for a while but I don't really carry around notebooks or textbooks or anything, just a medium sized makeup bag.\n\nI attached some of the bags I liked but think are ugly. And a bag I like the color of (the pink one).\nI realize this sounds like I'm trolling but I swear I'm just fed up and annoyed with my selection. Why, as a woman, do I have to have a small non-functional backpack in order for it to be pink or at least not ugly?",

Not perfect but it works great for the low price of \"free\" ha.\n\nThat new Shimoda looks even more potentially perfect except for the even higher cost (especially after the Kickstarter).\n\nHere's my Herschel backpack. Won it at a work event. Didn't even want it but now is my most used bag haha\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qci1b8a3u0c1.jpeg?width=3492&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c990e11b3ebefe37d10188d47cee39abb149fdc",

        "selftext": "I've been eyeing this bag for a while but I'm hesitating to buy it as it is not a proper hiking backpack. Side note, I have an aversion to typical hiking backpacks as I find the \"single large compartment design\" very impractical, even if there's a side opening and even if I'm using packing cubes. I find it difficult to access specific items without having to empty or dig through everything. I prefer a backpack with better organization features, like multiple compartments for example.  \n[This one](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-35l-travel-pack-4?variant=41266075926589) has all the basic requirements (chest and waist straps, stretchy water bottle side pocket, padded air mesh on straps and backpannel, etc.) as well as practical features like a suitcase style design, which I find quite appealing.  \nHave any of you tried it? Are there obvious reasons why I shouldn't get it for this type of hike? For context, I'm a 31 yo female in good physical health.  \nLooking forward to your knowledgeable input!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a2qdwnqixyhd1.jpg?width=811&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0f94edd88fea81a4529f80e6c610e1ea053ccc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5gr5oqixyhd1.jpg?width=937&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc9b9169a03a62455539b1be52e10d0d3571345\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2h3yiqqixyhd1.jpg?width=933&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0755b632c45bc05d20d8e5f044da22407b7b0655\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v3j98pqixyhd1.jpg?width=940&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce55969f8b51e53d3fb7653a70504009c84f6dbc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ro8k44sixyhd1.jpg?width=937&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fc0f84466d42db3f6356c0747ce820fb369018\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zowoqqixyhd1.jpg?width=937&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0f8ab3af6bc382cdfd5df011d971e20ee89b006\n\n",

            "body": "Looks like a really nice travel backpack, but maybe not such a great Camino backpack. The boxy shape and single water bottle pocket (as opposed to one on each side or a hydration pack) won’t distribute weight as effectively as a hiking pack, which could put stress on your shoulders and back. This bag does have a hip belt, but it doesn’t seem to have the contouring or extra padding that a hiking-specific pack would have - not a huge deal with a small bag, but that matters if you’re carrying a fully loaded 35L pack all day. I totally hear you about the disorganization with one big compartment, but this suitcase design would bother me more, I think. I appreciate being able to just quickly stop and stuff my fleece or raincoat or the groceries I just bought into my top-loading pack without having to open up the whole pack and inner compartments to find a spot for them. Plus, a lot of hiking packs make up for that one giant compartment with robust external organization - my current pack has big water bottle pockets (I use a water bladder, so those mostly hold things like my rain cover and snacks,) a top compartment, hip belt pockets big enough for a phone, and a stretchy stuff pocket on the front, and I can grab items from any of those without taking the pack off. All of which is to say: if you already had this pack, I think it’d be fine to bring it, but since you’re still looking, I would recommend exploring some more hiking-oriented options. If you’re in the U.S., have you looked at the REI Trail 40? Or if you want something smaller, Osprey has some panel-loading packs - Hikelite and Sportlite, and the 24L version of the Sirrus.",
