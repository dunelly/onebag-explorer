            "body": "In the past I have tried a few of packable packpacks, Matador Refraction, Aer Go, Rennen ripstop, Cotopaxi Luzon, but my favorite ended up being the Cotopaxi Batac 18.  Its a true packable and doesn't have much structure it can be compressed very small and even into its own pocket then folded a few times.  In many ways its my ideal packable backpack cause its strap/harness is the best for someone my size.  I always thought, it would be nice if it was bigger though (though tbh the 18 is plenty roomy, way larger than the matador and about the same volume as the Aer Go or Rennen Ripstop despite those being listed as larger 20 L bags).  So when I saw the Batac 24L on a sale on Cotopaxi so ordered one to try it out.  I've been looking at the larger Batac for awhile and its never on sale so this was the right time.  \n\nThe Batac 24 is very similar but adds a few things to the 18's design.  For one it has an external laptop compartment with side zip access.  This sleeve isn't suspended and is virtually unpadded, so I'd use a padded sleeve for your laptop or tablet, it would not really be good as an edc laptop carrier, but at least its there and will do in a pinch.  The biggest change is it has some light foam padding on the back, so it sort of has a soft sheet frame built in to provide it with structure to bear more weight, which comes in handy.  This robs it of the 18's true packability and puts in the same catagory of \"flat packable\" as the Aer Go or Rennen Ripstop (those also have light padding on the back, the Batac 24’s is slightly more than theirs).  Its more cut out for someone looking for a lightweight daypack but has more volume needs than those other, smaller bags.  The shoulder straps which worked so well for the batac 18 also feel good on the 24, but since it has so much space if you end up packing it heavier it can overwhelm the bag.  If carrying some weight for a long time, I'd go with a more structured backpack tbh.  But I don't think thats what this bag is designed for.  The Batac 24 weighs 1.1lbs by my scale and the 18 at just under a lb.\n\nThese are maybe my favorite lightweight backpacks, construction is good and the design is good.  The crazy colors and random fabrics will not be for everyone, but I can recommend the 18 as my fave compressible, packable backpack and the 24 as much larger option, which can also be flat packed, but probably more useful for someone looking for a lightweight backpack that isn't too delicate or flimsy or technical and expensive.\n\nAs always, happy to answer any questions.  I'm selling the packable Luzon 18 I mentioned for cheap on the [Nomad Nation marketplace](https://district.net/nomads/listings?seller=jonuiuc) if were interested.  That one is sort of like simplified Batac 18 but with a drawstring instead of a zipper, it actually fits more and packs even smaller, into its own pocket (I probably have an old post about it somewhere, check my profile post history).",

            "body": "In the past I have tried a few of packable packpacks, Matador Refraction, Aer Go, Rennen ripstop, Cotopaxi Luzon, but my favorite ended up being the Cotopaxi Batac 18.  Its a true packable and doesn't have much structure it can be compressed very small and even into its own pocket then folded a few times.  In many ways its my ideal packable backpack cause its strap/harness is the best for someone my size.  I always thought, it would be nice if it was bigger though (though tbh the 18 is plenty roomy, way larger than the matador and about the same volume as the Aer Go or Rennen Ripstop despite those being listed as larger 20 L bags).  So when I saw the Batac 24L on a sale on Cotopaxi so ordered one to try it out.  I've been looking at the larger Batac for awhile and its never on sale so this was the right time.  \n\nThe Batac 24 is very similar but adds a few things to the 18's design.  For one it has an external laptop compartment with side zip access.  This sleeve isn't suspended and is virtually unpadded, so I'd use a padded sleeve for your laptop or tablet, it would not really be good as an edc laptop carrier, but at least its there and will do in a pinch.  The biggest change is it has some light foam padding on the back, so it sort of has a soft sheet frame built in to provide it with structure to bear more weight, which comes in handy.  This robs it of the 18's true packability and puts in the same catagory of \"flat packable\" as the Aer Go or Rennen Ripstop (those also have light padding on the back, the Batac 24’s is slightly more than theirs).  Its more cut out for someone looking for a lightweight daypack but has more volume needs than those other, smaller bags.  The shoulder straps which worked so well for the batac 18 also feel good on the 24, but since it has so much space if you end up packing it heavier it can overwhelm the bag.  If carrying some weight for a long time, I'd go with a more structured backpack tbh.  But I don't think thats what this bag is designed for.  The Batac 24 weighs 1.1lbs by my scale and the 18 at just under a lb.\n\nThese are maybe my favorite lightweight backpacks, construction is good and the design is good.  The crazy colors and random fabrics will not be for everyone, but I can recommend the 18 as my fave compressible, packable backpack and the 24 as much larger option, which can also be flat packed, but probably more useful for someone looking for a lightweight backpack that isn't too delicate or flimsy or technical and expensive.\n\nAs always, happy to answer any questions.  I'm selling the packable Luzon 18 I mentioned for cheap on the [Nomad Nation marketplace](https://district.net/nomads/listings?seller=jonuiuc) if were interested.  That one is sort of like simplified Batac 18 but with a drawstring instead of a zipper, it actually fits more and packs even smaller, into its own pocket (I probably have an old post about it somewhere, check my profile post history).",

When it arrived, I noticed it was a little similar to a Rennen Ripstop daypack which I already had so it would be nice to compare them.  \n\n\nThe Batac is very similar to the Luzon in construction (the straps are the same), but it of course has zipper, and is slightly smaller.  The Batac has two external bottle pockets, a large vertical zip pocket with a little internal organization, and a internal mesh zip pocket.  For something with no padding, perhaps because of the design of the straps and overall shape and layout, this pack wears really well.  Its more set up for hiking and outdoor use vs the rennen but would work as a flat packable bag for travel in a pinch. The batac doesn't have a packable stowaway pocket like the luzon, though it easily fits in its own front pocket, that pocket is so big it doesn't compress it much, but at least it would save the straps from dangling.  \n\n\nThe Rennen on the other hand is a little beefier.  Its light and flexible enough to pack flat easily, but its more set up to be a very lightweight EDC, like the normal Rennen versions.  Its got a nice traditional type shape.  The padding is thin and light but more substantial than any packable type that could be self compressed into a pocket.  The straps are nice and padded, but I got an optional sternum strap to add on to prevent the straight straps from splaying when worn (I'm a bigger guy, if you have a narrower chest it may not be an issue).  The Rennen is probably competes more with something like a Aer Go Pack 2.    \n\n\nI think there is a lot of overlap between the two bags, and I probably don't need both, but I like them enough to keep them both.  The Rennen probably is better for urban / student / commuter / edc use as it can carry a laptop (you probably want a sleeve for that laptop though) and the Batac better for more athletic usages, plus with the colors you pretty much know if you are a cotopaxi person or not.  If you really wanted a packable backpack that really compressed, I'd point you to the luzon if you can live without a top zipper, if not, Batac will work in a pinch unless you need to carry a laptop, then the Rennen.",

            "body": "Recently got the Batac backpack after good experiences with the Cotopaxi Luzon and Taal.  When it arrived, I noticed it was a little similar to a Rennen Ripstop daypack which I already had so it would be nice to compare them.  \n\n\nThe Batac is very similar to the Luzon in construction (the straps are the same), but it of course has zipper, and is slightly smaller.  The Batac has two external bottle pockets, a large vertical zip pocket with a little internal organization, and a internal mesh zip pocket.  For something with no padding, perhaps because of the design of the straps and overall shape and layout, this pack wears really well.  Its more set up for hiking and outdoor use vs the rennen but would work as a flat packable bag for travel in a pinch. The batac doesn't have a packable stowaway pocket like the luzon, though it easily fits in its own front pocket, that pocket is so big it doesn't compress it much, but at least it would save the straps from dangling.  \n\n\nThe Rennen on the other hand is a little beefier.  Its light and flexible enough to pack flat easily, but its more set up to be a very lightweight EDC, like the normal Rennen versions.  Its got a nice traditional type shape.  The padding is thin and light but more substantial than any packable type that could be self compressed into a pocket.  The straps are nice and padded, but I got an optional sternum strap to add on to prevent the straight straps from splaying when worn (I'm a bigger guy, if you have a narrower chest it may not be an issue).  The Rennen is probably competes more with something like a Aer Go Pack 2.    \n\n\nI think there is a lot of overlap between the two bags, and I probably don't need both, but I like them enough to keep them both.  The Rennen probably is better for urban / student / commuter / edc use as it can carry a laptop (you probably want a sleeve for that laptop though) and the Batac better for more athletic usages, plus with the colors you pretty much know if you are a cotopaxi person or not.  If you really wanted a packable backpack that really compressed, I'd point you to the luzon if you can live without a top zipper, if not, Batac will work in a pinch unless you need to carry a laptop, then the Rennen.",
