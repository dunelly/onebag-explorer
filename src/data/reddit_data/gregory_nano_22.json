The MPL was very comfortable, and I‚Äôm a big\n fan of the vented back panel (this is coming \nfrom someone who sweats profusely).  I‚Äôm \n5‚Äô6‚Äù with a longer torso and shorter legs.  I \ndidn‚Äôt experience any issues with lower back\n rubbing that many report with Evergoods \nbags.\n\nMy loadout (sorry I couldn‚Äôt take more interior pics)\n\nExterior:\n\n- CAP1 Xpac Blue: first aid kit\n- Pupflask dog water bottle\n- Sunglass container attached to Heroclip\n- Strap attachment purchased on Amazon to easily store my Osmo Pocket 3 and a few accessories.  This is critical for me to make it easy to quickly access and put away my Osmo on short notice.\n- Sunglass wipe attachment\n\nInterior:\n\n- Patagonia jacket packed down into a ball\n- 2 kids jackets\n- dog food collapsible bowl\n- orange CAP2 with my remaining Osmo Pocket 3 accessories (this is where I normally store all my Pocket 3 stuff)\n- CAP1 Xpac in the bigger exterior pocket (holds my everyday essentials that I frequently switch between bags - wallet, miscellaneous cards that I don‚Äôt need everyday, gum, cables, Beats Pro earphones)\n- snacks in the exterior smaller pocket\n- keys\n- other items stuff in that I don‚Äôt remember at the moment (dog treats, etc).\n\nBefore I forget, credit to u/_flyingelbowdrop_ for the half/triangle patch on the Evergoods logo.\n\nEarlier this week, I gave rucking my very first shot using the MPL.  I‚Äôm a fit guy who‚Äôs currently in a cut-cycle of my strength lifting program, so rucking seems to be a good fit to get low-impact cardio that hopefully won‚Äôt interfere with my lifts.\n\nI stayed very conservative and followed GoRucks advice to start with 20lbs.  I used 2 10x iron plates wrapped in a towel placed in the interior sleeve.  I also had additional dog accessories and bottles.  I‚Äôm happy to report the MPL22 was again very comfortable rucking.  However, the interior pouch got a bit stretched out by the plates.  Given that I‚Äôm planning on using heavier weights going forward, I decided to get a GoRuck Rucker 4.0 going forward, even though the MPL did a great job otherwise.\n\nThanks to everyone‚Äôs post in this subreddit.

        "selftext": "This past weekend I took my MPL22 for an easy hike with the family and our new English Lab puppy around Horseshoe Lake in Mammoth, CA.\nThe pack was light, flexible, versatile, and \nserved my use case (easy hikes) perfectly.  The MPL was very comfortable, and I‚Äôm a big\n fan of the vented back panel (this is coming \nfrom someone who sweats profusely).  I‚Äôm \n5‚Äô6‚Äù with a longer torso and shorter legs.  I \ndidn‚Äôt experience any issues with lower back\n rubbing that many report with Evergoods \nbags.\n\nMy loadout (sorry I couldn‚Äôt take more interior pics)\n\nExterior:\n\n- CAP1 Xpac Blue: first aid kit\n- Pupflask dog water bottle\n- Sunglass container attached to Heroclip\n- Strap attachment purchased on Amazon to easily store my Osmo Pocket 3 and a few accessories.  This is critical for me to make it easy to quickly access and put away my Osmo on short notice.\n- Sunglass wipe attachment\n\nInterior:\n\n- Patagonia jacket packed down into a ball\n- 2 kids jackets\n- dog food collapsible bowl\n- orange CAP2 with my remaining Osmo Pocket 3 accessories (this is where I normally store all my Pocket 3 stuff)\n- CAP1 Xpac in the bigger exterior pocket (holds my everyday essentials that I frequently switch between bags - wallet, miscellaneous cards that I don‚Äôt need everyday, gum, cables, Beats Pro earphones)\n- snacks in the exterior smaller pocket\n- keys\n- other items stuff in that I don‚Äôt remember at the moment (dog treats, etc).\n\nBefore I forget, credit to u/_flyingelbowdrop_ for the half/triangle patch on the Evergoods logo.\n\nEarlier this week, I gave rucking my very first shot using the MPL.  I‚Äôm a fit guy who‚Äôs currently in a cut-cycle of my strength lifting program, so rucking seems to be a good fit to get low-impact cardio that hopefully won‚Äôt interfere with my lifts.\n\nI stayed very conservative and followed GoRucks advice to start with 20lbs.  I used 2 10x iron plates wrapped in a towel placed in the interior sleeve.  I also had additional dog accessories and bottles.  I‚Äôm happy to report the MPL22 was again very comfortable rucking.  However, the interior pouch got a bit stretched out by the plates.  Given that I‚Äôm planning on using heavier weights going forward, I decided to get a GoRuck Rucker 4.0 going forward, even though the MPL did a great job otherwise.\n\nThanks to everyone‚Äôs post in this subreddit.  It really helped me make informed decisions about purchasing this bag.  So far I‚Äôm very happy with it.\n\n",

I found mine lightly used on the secondary for about 40% off. The plate sleeves are a game changer and your MPL22 elastic sleeve will thank you!\n\nNice write up!",

            "body": "Before I get to the Catalyst I want to provide some background that led me here. I‚Äôm a huge fan of the Coulee series. The Coulee 25 has been my go-to travel bag / carryon for about 4 years. A few months ago I upgraded to the new Coulee 30 with the intent of selling the 25, but I just haven‚Äôt gotten around to selling it yet so I still have it on hand to compare to. I prefer the Coulee‚Äôs single large dump pocket versus other bags with multiple smaller pockets because I can utilize the space however I want, without dealing with pockets that don‚Äôt quite fit my gear. I just returned from a beach vacation which had me carrying a towel, swimsuit, sandals, and other large items which were no problem for the Coulee because of the big main pocket. But on other trips I may need more smaller items which is still no problem because I can organize them into smaller cubes. I feel like the Coulee punches above its weight class in terms of capacity and can carry more items than larger bags for this reason, without feeling like a large bag. Although I feel like this is a function of the 3-zip design in general and not really specific to the Coulee.   \nBut I‚Äôve often felt that 2 upgrades would make the Coulee nearly perfect: A laptop pocket, and some additional organization in the main pocket.  \nI realize saying the Coulee needs internal organization contradicts what I said previously about preferring its large dump pocket. But I believed it would be possible to add some level of organization for smaller items without subtracting from its overall capacity.  \nRegarding needing a laptop pocket, that‚Äôs the one area where the Coulee sucks. When I have the main pocket loaded out, it can be very difficult to dig out a laptop or iPad. Especially on an airplane. \n\nAll this to say, when the Catalyst was announced, I jumped all over it. To me it seemed like a Coulee with the 2 additional upgrades that I'd been hoping for. Unfortunately it doesn't have the 2 extra exterior pockets that the Coulee has, but I'll take that trade off for the laptop pocket.  \nMy overall thoughts so far on the Catalyst, and comments from the attached pictures:  \n\\- It very well could be the closest I‚Äôve come to the perfect onebag for my needs.  \n\\- I put the same size pillow in both the Coulee 25 and Catalyst 26, and both bags seemed about equal in capacity. I was worried that the Catalyst‚Äôs laptop sleeve might subtract from the capacity of the main pocket, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. As expected, the Coulee 30 is noticeably larger.  \n\\- The brain pocket on the lid of the Catalyst is slightly smaller than that of the Coulee 25, and significantly smaller than that of the Coulee 30.   \n\\- It can usually stand up on its own depending on how it‚Äôs loaded, but even when it can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs still far more stable than the Coulee.  \n\\- I wish the vertical zipper of the Catalyst went all the way to the bottom of the bag like the Coulee, but I suspect the bottom and zipper design of the Catalyst is what provides enough stability for it to stand up on its own so it‚Äôs a fair trade off. But it‚Äôs worth noting that the Catalyst doesn‚Äôt open as wide as the Coulee.  \n\\- The laptop compartment is very unobtrusive and I don‚Äôt think it will feel like wasted space when I‚Äôm not carrying a laptop of tablet.  \n\\- The water bottle sleeves will accommodate my 26oz Yeti tumbler. But I do wish the pockets were made of the same stretchy material as the Coulee.   \n\\- I wish there were attachment loops in the main compartment for Zoid bags (or anything else). That was something MR added to the Coulee 30 and I really like them. In my opinion, every MR bag should come loaded with attachment loops. Much like how virtually all Tom Bihn bags come loaded up with o-ring loops all over the place.   \nAll things considered, it‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs very close. Change the water bottle sleeves to stretchy material and add some internal attachment loops and it‚Äôs darn near as good as it gets. I‚Äôd love the 2 extra exterior pockets like the Coulee but I understand that may be a distinguishing feature reserved for the Coulee so we may never see it on the Catalyst (and I also realize many people may prefer a sleeker exterior that doesn‚Äôt have those extra pockets). \n\nI haven't traveled with the Catalyst yet, but I have a big trip coming up in a few weeks that I'm excited to bring it on.",

There‚Äôs very little out there review wise or anything on Reddit about this pack, so thought it might be useful to chuck my thoughts out there. \n\nFor starters, the dimensions on Patagonia‚Äôs website are wildly wrong. They‚Äôre listed as 58.4 x 29.2 x 26.7 cm whereas I packed this bag with the packing list in the comments, and easily cinched the bag to the dimensions of 46x24x22 cm (18x9x8 inches)which are only just barely over the threshold for EasyJet and other budget airlines, and certainly not big enough to warrant unnecessary scrutiny at the gate. With that being said, I think it‚Äôs still easy to squish and manoeuvre the bag to fit the sizers, as long as you haven‚Äôt packed it to the absolute gills. \n\nWhy I think it‚Äôs great: I love having one big cavernous section, as I do my own organisation. With this being a top loader, and a fairly narrow opening, packing cubes will be your friend, but not essential. You really do feel like you‚Äôre maximising every centimetre of the bag‚Äôs capacity with this one big compartment. There is a small internal zip pouch big enough for passport + phone + battery pack, a thin laptop/tablet/hydration sleeve within, a front drop pocket, two water bottle side pockets, plus a decent sized zipped pocket on the lid. However, for the purposes of cinching down to a compatible size, might be worth leaving that lid pocket empty, at least for the exact moment you would need to put it into a sizer. \n\nIt‚Äôs light at just under 800g, incredibly comfortable with a nice hip belt and sternum strap, and it comes with an included rain cover with its own separate stash pocket at the foot of the bag, which is obviously great for rain protection during hikes or transit, but also as a way to keep the bag clean on dirty under-seat plane floors and as theft prevention. \n\nThe top loading style might not be to everyone‚Äôs taste, and the strap to fasten the lid closure is unnecessarily long, which could frustrate some. Personally I don‚Äôt mind, as it can easily be tucked away into the front drop pocket, or even cut off, and using the front drop pocket clasp to fasten the lid. \n\nAs mentioned above, I fit a week‚Äôs worth of winter clothes packed into this bag and it fit the dimensions listed above. Summer packing would be lighter I‚Äôd imagine, hence trying the winter list, but YMMV.  \n\nOverall I‚Äôm really impressed by this bag, and can‚Äôt wait to utilise this a lot over the coming years. Hopefully this review can give people some of the answers that I myself was looking for in my bag search. ",

        "selftext": "A recentish onebag traveller that has made do with insufficient bags until stumbling upon this community. \n\nFound my perfect travel bag in the Patagonia Terravia 28l. There‚Äôs very little out there review wise or anything on Reddit about this pack, so thought it might be useful to chuck my thoughts out there. \n\nFor starters, the dimensions on Patagonia‚Äôs website are wildly wrong. They‚Äôre listed as 58.4 x 29.2 x 26.7 cm whereas I packed this bag with the packing list in the comments, and easily cinched the bag to the dimensions of 46x24x22 cm (18x9x8 inches)which are only just barely over the threshold for EasyJet and other budget airlines, and certainly not big enough to warrant unnecessary scrutiny at the gate. With that being said, I think it‚Äôs still easy to squish and manoeuvre the bag to fit the sizers, as long as you haven‚Äôt packed it to the absolute gills. \n\nWhy I think it‚Äôs great: I love having one big cavernous section, as I do my own organisation. With this being a top loader, and a fairly narrow opening, packing cubes will be your friend, but not essential. You really do feel like you‚Äôre maximising every centimetre of the bag‚Äôs capacity with this one big compartment. There is a small internal zip pouch big enough for passport + phone + battery pack, a thin laptop/tablet/hydration sleeve within, a front drop pocket, two water bottle side pockets, plus a decent sized zipped pocket on the lid. However, for the purposes of cinching down to a compatible size, might be worth leaving that lid pocket empty, at least for the exact moment you would need to put it into a sizer. \n\nIt‚Äôs light at just under 800g, incredibly comfortable with a nice hip belt and sternum strap, and it comes with an included rain cover with its own separate stash pocket at the foot of the bag, which is obviously great for rain protection during hikes or transit, but also as a way to keep the bag clean on dirty under-seat plane floors and as theft prevention. \n\nThe top loading style might not be to everyone‚Äôs taste, and the strap to fasten the lid closure is unnecessarily long, which could frustrate some. Personally I don‚Äôt mind, as it can easily be tucked away into the front drop pocket, or even cut off, and using the front drop pocket clasp to fasten the lid. \n\nAs mentioned above, I fit a week‚Äôs worth of winter clothes packed into this bag and it fit the dimensions listed above. Summer packing would be lighter I‚Äôd imagine, hence trying the winter list, but YMMV.  \n\nOverall I‚Äôm really impressed by this bag, and can‚Äôt wait to utilise this a lot over the coming years. Hopefully this review can give people some of the answers that I myself was looking for in my bag search. ",

            "body": "**Gregory Nano 20** is a 20L daypack that I've been actively using for about a week. I've cycled with it, taken it to the office and on a small hike as well. Bought the pack with my own money, no affiliation with Gregory, honest thoughts only.\n\nGregory sells the Nano 20 in many different colors (and there are also different sizes available with different features). I picked the Woodland Camo version which looked the nicest because I really like camo and it looks more subtle on this bag compared to tactical backpacks, for example. Really digging the look and all the features it has for a daypack that costs about 50-60 bucks.\n\nBuild quality is really nice too, I was expecting to find maybe some loose threads or questionable stitching considering the sophisticated design of the bag, but the Nano is actually very well made and I feel its 210D Honeycomb CryptoRip HD Nylon material will hold up nicely while being quite thin and light (the bottom however is made of tougher 420D High Density Nylon).\n\nRegarding the capacity, I usually like around 25L on my EDC bags but I was interested in the Nano 20's front mesh pocket that can be closed with a buckle for extra security. ~~God wants you to put your snacks there.~~ This pocket provides some handy extra space for accessories or smaller clothes (maybe a hat or gloves, or a lighter sweater).\n\nAs I mentioned, the bag does have a lot of extra features and it has been surprising to me so far how much can be attached to the exterior of the bag. For example, I could easily cram a sweater in the front mesh pocket and use one of the side compression straps (the Nano 20 has one compression strap on both sides) to mount a jacket or something to the side of the pack.\n\nThere are a few little extra loops on the front side if you want to clip something to the exterior, too.\n\nThe Nano 20 also has two mesh bottle pockets that hold my CamelBak Chute Mag and Klean Kanteen bottles easily, but the side pockets are not stretchy enough to take a bigger Nalgene.\n\nPeople who need a bunch of smaller pockets for organization may find the Nano 20 a bit lacking and I have to admit that its top organizer pocket feels a bit simple and shallow to me (for my needs anyway). The organizer pocket right above the front mesh pocket isn't very deep and it tends to [chaotically fill up](https://i.imgur.com/GJOJ1vE.jpeg) quite easily, so there is not a lot to work with in terms of organization.\n\nThe top organizer pocket has two sleeves and a keyring, which is a nice addition but this entire compartment is basically just meant for keys, wallet and phone for example. I carry a Savotta trinket pouch, a little multitool, knife, keys, wipes, pen and some other small stuff that I had to shove into the top organizer pocket and it is quite full now, but all my items are pretty easy to find when I unzip the pocket, despite the mess.\n\nThe Nano 20's harness is really nice and comfy. The shoulder straps are quite thin but wide. The harness offers lots of support to the neck. No complaints there, it's comfy to wear, especially if you're thin and tall.\n\nYou also get a sternum strap and a hip belt, which is not removable but the bag comes with a little sleeve on the bottom of the back panel, so you can tuck away the hip belt and forget about it until you need it. Pretty nice.\n\nThe back panel looks quite sophisticated (it's like a sturdy but thin mesh that's built into the bag, kind of?) but so far, I'm not sure if the ventilation is as good as you'd think. It's decent. The back panel has a nice curve so it doesn't feel like I'm carrying a box on my back.\n\nThere is a separate compartment for a hydration bladder that can double as a laptop sleeve, which is something that Gregory even [advertises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCDLPTM0N6k) in one of their videos about the Nano 20. There is no padding in this compartment so I'd definitely recommend a protective laptop sleeve (I use the Incase ICON Sleeve that has a special bumper for shock protection, so I don't care whether my backpack has a padded laptop sleeve or not).\n\nBut this compartment actually leads me to my main problem with the bag, which isn't a dealbreaker necessarily, but every bag tends to have one big flaw in my experience, and so does the Nano 20. My main issue is that the bag is built and structured in a way that all the compartments tend to eat into each other.\n\nIf I really fill up the main compartment, which is just one big bucket, the wall between the main compartment and laptop/bladder compartment is so thin that the laptop/bladder compartment becomes super tight and it's really difficult to take out or put in my laptop.\n\nSame deal with the front mesh pocket - there is more space in there if the bag is half-full. If the main compartment is really filled up, there is less space in the mesh pocket. So I have to be more thoughtful about my packing with the Nano 20 compared to some other bags I've had.\n\nMy usual load: Bose QC45 headphones in case, Macbook Air (in sleeve), vest/jacket, various accessories that I listed above, Aer Tech Pouch, iPad Mini, sometimes food. I could definitely take his bag on a small trip if I wanted to because I can also fit my Thule Compression Packing Cube and toiletry bag in the main compartment, but then it does start getting really tight.\n\nIt's a very solid daypack for the price, but perhaps better built for casual hiking than commuting and going to work with it, because of its lack of organization and poor structure that doesn't accommodate expensive tech very well.",

            "body": "**Gregory Nano 20** is a 20L daypack that I've been actively using for about a week. I've cycled with it, taken it to the office and on a small hike as well. Bought the pack with my own money, no affiliation with Gregory, honest thoughts only.\n\nGregory sells the Nano 20 in many different colors (and there are also different sizes available with different features). I picked the Woodland Camo version which looked the nicest because I really like camo and it looks more subtle on this bag compared to tactical backpacks, for example. Really digging the look and all the features it has for a daypack that costs about 50-60 bucks.\n\nBuild quality is really nice too, I was expecting to find maybe some loose threads or questionable stitching considering the sophisticated design of the bag, but the Nano is actually very well made and I feel its 210D Honeycomb CryptoRip HD Nylon material will hold up nicely while being quite thin and light (the bottom however is made of tougher 420D High Density Nylon).\n\nRegarding the capacity, I usually like around 25L on my EDC bags but I was interested in the Nano 20's front mesh pocket that can be closed with a buckle for extra security. ~~God wants you to put your snacks there.~~ This pocket provides some handy extra space for accessories or smaller clothes (maybe a hat or gloves, or a lighter sweater).\n\nAs I mentioned, the bag does have a lot of extra features and it has been surprising to me so far how much can be attached to the exterior of the bag. For example, I could easily cram a sweater in the front mesh pocket and use one of the side compression straps (the Nano 20 has one compression strap on both sides) to mount a jacket or something to the side of the pack.\n\nThere are a few little extra loops on the front side if you want to clip something to the exterior, too.\n\nThe Nano 20 also has two mesh bottle pockets that hold my CamelBak Chute Mag and Klean Kanteen bottles easily, but the side pockets are not stretchy enough to take a bigger Nalgene.\n\nPeople who need a bunch of smaller pockets for organization may find the Nano 20 a bit lacking and I have to admit that its top organizer pocket feels a bit simple and shallow to me (for my needs anyway). The organizer pocket right above the front mesh pocket isn't very deep and it tends to [chaotically fill up](https://i.imgur.com/GJOJ1vE.jpeg) quite easily, so there is not a lot to work with in terms of organization.\n\nThe top organizer pocket has two sleeves and a keyring, which is a nice addition but this entire compartment is basically just meant for keys, wallet and phone for example. I carry a Savotta trinket pouch, a little multitool, knife, keys, wipes, pen and some other small stuff that I had to shove into the top organizer pocket and it is quite full now, but all my items are pretty easy to find when I unzip the pocket, despite the mess.\n\nThe Nano 20's harness is really nice and comfy. The shoulder straps are quite thin but wide. The harness offers lots of support to the neck. No complaints there, it's comfy to wear, especially if you're thin and tall.\n\nYou also get a sternum strap and a hip belt, which is not removable but the bag comes with a little sleeve on the bottom of the back panel, so you can tuck away the hip belt and forget about it until you need it. Pretty nice.\n\nThe back panel looks quite sophisticated (it's like a sturdy but thin mesh that's built into the bag, kind of?) but so far, I'm not sure if the ventilation is as good as you'd think. It's decent. The back panel has a nice curve so it doesn't feel like I'm carrying a box on my back.\n\nThere is a separate compartment for a hydration bladder that can double as a laptop sleeve, which is something that Gregory even [advertises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCDLPTM0N6k) in one of their videos about the Nano 20. There is no padding in this compartment so I'd definitely recommend a protective laptop sleeve (I use the Incase ICON Sleeve that has a special bumper for shock protection, so I don't care whether my backpack has a padded laptop sleeve or not).\n\nBut this compartment actually leads me to my main problem with the bag, which isn't a dealbreaker necessarily, but every bag tends to have one big flaw in my experience, and so does the Nano 20. My main issue is that the bag is built and structured in a way that all the compartments tend to eat into each other.\n\nIf I really fill up the main compartment, which is just one big bucket, the wall between the main compartment and laptop/bladder compartment is so thin that the laptop/bladder compartment becomes super tight and it's really difficult to take out or put in my laptop.\n\nSame deal with the front mesh pocket - there is more space in there if the bag is half-full. If the main compartment is really filled up, there is less space in the mesh pocket. So I have to be more thoughtful about my packing with the Nano 20 compared to some other bags I've had.\n\nMy usual load: Bose QC45 headphones in case, Macbook Air (in sleeve), vest/jacket, various accessories that I listed above, Aer Tech Pouch, iPad Mini, sometimes food. I could definitely take his bag on a small trip if I wanted to because I can also fit my Thule Compression Packing Cube and toiletry bag in the main compartment, but then it does start getting really tight.\n\nIt's a very solid daypack for the price, but perhaps better built for casual hiking than commuting and going to work with it, because of its lack of organization and poor structure that doesn't accommodate expensive tech very well.",

            "body": "I've seen a couple other geologists list out their EDC gear so I figured I'd do the same. I'm a geologist in brownfields exploration (near mine) in NV.¬†\n\n\n\n\n## In my Deakin cruiser vest (with radio pouch) (image 1) ##\n\n\n\n\n### From bottom left to top right ###\n\n\n- Glove clip - this thing is super handy for hanging my gloves or hat on if I need to take them off for a minute. I'm adding another one when I get back home.\n- Sofirn SP40 headlamp (inside pocket) - for when power goes out in the core shed and I need light.\n- Gloves (other inside pocket) - gotta protect those hands.\n- Lufkin inch/metric engineers tape measure - we work in US customary and metric units and use tenths instead of twelfths increments. This one does it all.\n- Sofirn SP35 handheld flashlight - you can never have too many flashlights and this sucker is BRIGHT for its size.\n- Safety glasses, clear - for when I need to protect my eyes and it's dark/not sunny.\n- Luer lock bottles (2) - I've found the Luer lock bottles leak the least. 1 bottle filled with 10% HCl (essential when working with carbonates), the other bottle holds some blunt Luer lock needles. These things are super useful for exact placement of acid, nice to have when chip logging.\n- Earplugs - if I'm out at a rig earplugs are required PPE. Don't usually use them as I have hardhat mounted ear muffs that are more convenient.¬†\n- Pencil - for writing. I like this kind because it has a big eraser, I make lots of mistakes.\n- Pencils (2) - can never have too many pencils.\n- Pick and grease pencil - worn down hardened steel pick for scratch testing, grease pencil for marking up core.\n- Sharpie (2) and protractor - permanent markers for writing up sample tags/bags, writing on core boxes, anything else, always carry 2 of things that can run out. Protractor used to measure structural data in core.\n- Tungsten carbide scriber - used for powdering rocks (essential when dealing with altered carbonates).\n- Tweezers (2) - one straight tip, one angled tip, hardened steel tweezers. Useful when you drop your protractor into a core box. Mostly used for chip logging. I can manipulate rock chips and do scratch tests under a microscope with the same tool and it immensely helps in rock identification. They also speed up chip logging a little.\n- Rite in the Rain notebook (inside notebook pocket) - I think every geologist has a box full of these. Expensive, but totally worth it.¬†\n- ID badge - I work at a mine site so I'm constantly badging in and out of restricted areas. I have it on a retractable leash so I can reach out the truck window with it easily.\n- Lumber crayon - used to mark structural data on core. If we see a fold or a fault or a good bedding plane we will mark it, measure it (protractor) and put it in our notes so it can be logged later.\n- Safety glasses, shaded - it's bright in NV. Gotta have shades. Both safety glasses have gaskets as the dust and sand can get blown around and into your eyes pretty easily.\n- Leatherman - not even sure which model it is but I'll be upgrading to one with a pair of scissors soon.\n- Belomo 10x hand lens - for getting a good look at the details. Really useful when identifying igneous intrusives and such. I'll probably upgrade to an Iwamoto soon, they're like the Rolls Royce of hand lens.\n- Gregory Nano 22 backpack - used for carrying my bulky stuff (image 2).\n- Coleman insulated water bottle - it's dry in NV. Gotta drink a lot of water.\n\n\n\n\n## On my head: ## \n\n\n- Klein hard hat with light and hearing protection - it's got vents to keep my head from sweating during the summer. It's definitely worth the money. We don't typically have to get close enough to the rigs to need hearing protection and we're not even drilling right now so I took the ear muffs off to save a bit of weight.\n- Tilley T3 hat - keeps the sun off my head when I don't have to wear a hard hat. Also keeps off the rain. I swear by Tilley, great hats. This one has been in lakes and oceans and rivers and never came off my head, even without the straps.\n- AfterShockz bone conduction headset - another worthy purchase. I can listen to music, podcasts, etc. or talk on the phone and don't lose my situational awareness. Important when working around heavy machinery.\n\n\n\nBackpack list in reply.",

It's chilly in NV right now.\n- REI rain shell - lightweight and packable but keeps the rain off.\n- Samsung Smartthings tag - this sends me a notification if I walk off without my bag, which happens more than I like to admit.\n- SD to USB adapter - for transferring field pictures to the computer.\n- Olympus OMD-EM1 - good pictures are essential in Geology. I prefer a proper camera over a cell phone camera. Currently has a 25mm fixed lens but I've ordered a 12-40mm lens. A wider angle lens will be more useful. This is an old camera but it still takes great photos. I'll likely upgrade within the next year or so.\n- 65W USB-C charger - almost everything I have can be charged with this 1 charger. Very nice.\n- Lunch - usually Ready Rice with tuna or chicken\n-Personal first aid kit - never know when you're going to hurt yourself.¬†\n-Backpack (again)\n- Water bottle (again)\n- Contigo insulated coffee mug - keeps coffee as hot as I want it and it never spills, 2 essential traits in a good coffee mug.\n- Cholula - because it's awesome and rice needs some extra flavor. This one is the chipotle variety. This is always the first thing I get when I get into town.\n\n\n\n\n## Not pictured (in my pants pockets or on my body): ##\n\n\n\n\n- Wallet - front pocket, for holding my money and IDs.\n- SOG Flash II pocket knife - I guess this is unintentionally my favorite knife. I bought it almost a decade ago. I have had 3 or 4 knives I've bought after this one but this one usually always ends up in my pocket after a while. Not necessarily on purpose but it's always the one I grab without thinking. I've lost it at least 10 times, but I always find it, sometimes immediately, sometimes 6 months later after I've bought another knife. I keep it razor sharp using my water stones each time I go back home. I could shave with it if I wanted to.\n- Zippo lighter - there's just something about a Zippo. You never know when you're going to need to light something and a Zippo is always guaranteed to be empty when you need it.\n- Chapstick - because it's dry in NV.\n- Bandana - it's always nice to have a way to wipe something off, or dry your hands when the paper towels are empty, or soak it down and wrap it around your head.¬†\n- Streamlight Microstream - I'm a flashlight nut. This is the only thing I still have that isn't USB-C, but I only have to charge it about once a year. Great for finding that thing you dropped in the dark or finding your way out when someone turns the bathroom light out on you.\n- Railriders Xtreme Adventure Pant - only field pants I wear. Super tough, comfortable, hidden zipper compartment so I don't lose my wallet, and the cuffs Velcro so they slide into my boots easier. 2 pairs of these lasted through 6 weeks of field camp and still look almost brand new. I think they're made of spider silk or something.\n- Whites or JK boots - usually JK SuperDuty composite toe boots for mine site, custom Whites soft toe boots for field work that doesn't require safety toes.\n- I haven't found a good shirt that I've settled on yet. Currently wearing some shirts by Poncho Outdoors. I like these shirts and they are about 90% what I want (nylon, quick drying, button down with 2 pockets), but they just don't seem like they're going to hold up like I need. At $80 each I expect them to last more than 6 months before needing replaced.¬†\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. I'll answer any question I can about the gear or the job. If anyone has good outdoor shirt recommendations I'm all ears.",

            "body": "I've seen a couple other geologists list out their EDC gear so I figured I'd do the same. I'm a geologist in brownfields exploration (near mine) in NV.¬†\n\n\n\n\n## In my Deakin cruiser vest (with radio pouch) (image 1) ##\n\n\n\n\n### From bottom left to top right ###\n\n\n- Glove clip - this thing is super handy for hanging my gloves or hat on if I need to take them off for a minute. I'm adding another one when I get back home.\n- Sofirn SP40 headlamp (inside pocket) - for when power goes out in the core shed and I need light.\n- Gloves (other inside pocket) - gotta protect those hands.\n- Lufkin inch/metric engineers tape measure - we work in US customary and metric units and use tenths instead of twelfths increments. This one does it all.\n- Sofirn SP35 handheld flashlight - you can never have too many flashlights and this sucker is BRIGHT for its size.\n- Safety glasses, clear - for when I need to protect my eyes and it's dark/not sunny.\n- Luer lock bottles (2) - I've found the Luer lock bottles leak the least. 1 bottle filled with 10% HCl (essential when working with carbonates), the other bottle holds some blunt Luer lock needles. These things are super useful for exact placement of acid, nice to have when chip logging.\n- Earplugs - if I'm out at a rig earplugs are required PPE. Don't usually use them as I have hardhat mounted ear muffs that are more convenient.¬†\n- Pencil - for writing. I like this kind because it has a big eraser, I make lots of mistakes.\n- Pencils (2) - can never have too many pencils.\n- Pick and grease pencil - worn down hardened steel pick for scratch testing, grease pencil for marking up core.\n- Sharpie (2) and protractor - permanent markers for writing up sample tags/bags, writing on core boxes, anything else, always carry 2 of things that can run out. Protractor used to measure structural data in core.\n- Tungsten carbide scriber - used for powdering rocks (essential when dealing with altered carbonates).\n- Tweezers (2) - one straight tip, one angled tip, hardened steel tweezers. Useful when you drop your protractor into a core box. Mostly used for chip logging. I can manipulate rock chips and do scratch tests under a microscope with the same tool and it immensely helps in rock identification. They also speed up chip logging a little.\n- Rite in the Rain notebook (inside notebook pocket) - I think every geologist has a box full of these. Expensive, but totally worth it.¬†\n- ID badge - I work at a mine site so I'm constantly badging in and out of restricted areas. I have it on a retractable leash so I can reach out the truck window with it easily.\n- Lumber crayon - used to mark structural data on core. If we see a fold or a fault or a good bedding plane we will mark it, measure it (protractor) and put it in our notes so it can be logged later.\n- Safety glasses, shaded - it's bright in NV. Gotta have shades. Both safety glasses have gaskets as the dust and sand can get blown around and into your eyes pretty easily.\n- Leatherman - not even sure which model it is but I'll be upgrading to one with a pair of scissors soon.\n- Belomo 10x hand lens - for getting a good look at the details. Really useful when identifying igneous intrusives and such. I'll probably upgrade to an Iwamoto soon, they're like the Rolls Royce of hand lens.\n- Gregory Nano 22 backpack - used for carrying my bulky stuff (image 2).\n- Coleman insulated water bottle - it's dry in NV. Gotta drink a lot of water.\n\n\n\n\n## On my head: ## \n\n\n- Klein hard hat with light and hearing protection - it's got vents to keep my head from sweating during the summer. It's definitely worth the money. We don't typically have to get close enough to the rigs to need hearing protection and we're not even drilling right now so I took the ear muffs off to save a bit of weight.\n- Tilley T3 hat - keeps the sun off my head when I don't have to wear a hard hat. Also keeps off the rain. I swear by Tilley, great hats. This one has been in lakes and oceans and rivers and never came off my head, even without the straps.\n- AfterShockz bone conduction headset - another worthy purchase. I can listen to music, podcasts, etc. or talk on the phone and don't lose my situational awareness. Important when working around heavy machinery.\n\n\n\nBackpack list in reply.",

                "body": "Apparently my list was too long for 1 comment.\n\n## Inside my backpack (image 2): ##\n\n\n\n\n### From bottom left to top right ###\n\n\n- North Face fleece jacket - super light and super packable but still is really warm. It's chilly in NV right now.\n- REI rain shell - lightweight and packable but keeps the rain off.\n- Samsung Smartthings tag - this sends me a notification if I walk off without my bag, which happens more than I like to admit.\n- SD to USB adapter - for transferring field pictures to the computer.\n- Olympus OMD-EM1 - good pictures are essential in Geology. I prefer a proper camera over a cell phone camera. Currently has a 25mm fixed lens but I've ordered a 12-40mm lens. A wider angle lens will be more useful. This is an old camera but it still takes great photos. I'll likely upgrade within the next year or so.\n- 65W USB-C charger - almost everything I have can be charged with this 1 charger. Very nice.\n- Lunch - usually Ready Rice with tuna or chicken\n-Personal first aid kit - never know when you're going to hurt yourself.¬†\n-Backpack (again)\n- Water bottle (again)\n- Contigo insulated coffee mug - keeps coffee as hot as I want it and it never spills, 2 essential traits in a good coffee mug.\n- Cholula - because it's awesome and rice needs some extra flavor. This one is the chipotle variety. This is always the first thing I get when I get into town.\n\n\n\n\n## Not pictured (in my pants pockets or on my body): ##\n\n\n\n\n- Wallet - front pocket, for holding my money and IDs.\n- SOG Flash II pocket knife - I guess this is unintentionally my favorite knife. I bought it almost a decade ago. I have had 3 or 4 knives I've bought after this one but this one usually always ends up in my pocket after a while. Not necessarily on purpose but it's always the one I grab without thinking. I've lost it at least 10 times, but I always find it, sometimes immediately, sometimes 6 months later after I've bought another knife. I keep it razor sharp using my water stones each time I go back home. I could shave with it if I wanted to.\n- Zippo lighter - there's just something about a Zippo. You never know when you're going to need to light something and a Zippo is always guaranteed to be empty when you need it.\n- Chapstick - because it's dry in NV.\n- Bandana - it's always nice to have a way to wipe something off, or dry your hands when the paper towels are empty, or soak it down and wrap it around your head.¬†\n- Streamlight Microstream - I'm a flashlight nut. This is the only thing I still have that isn't USB-C, but I only have to charge it about once a year. Great for finding that thing you dropped in the dark or finding your way out when someone turns the bathroom light out on you.\n- Railriders Xtreme Adventure Pant - only field pants I wear. Super tough, comfortable, hidden zipper compartment so I don't lose my wallet, and the cuffs Velcro so they slide into my boots easier. 2 pairs of these lasted through 6 weeks of field camp and still look almost brand new. I think they're made of spider silk or something.\n- Whites or JK boots - usually JK SuperDuty composite toe boots for mine site, custom Whites soft toe boots for field work that doesn't require safety toes.\n- I haven't found a good shirt that I've settled on yet. Currently wearing some shirts by Poncho Outdoors. I like these shirts and they are about 90% what I want (nylon, quick drying, button down with 2 pockets), but they just don't seem like they're going to hold up like I need. At $80 each I expect them to last more than 6 months before needing replaced.¬†\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. I'll answer any question I can about the gear or the job. If anyone has good outdoor shirt recommendations I'm all ears.",

I‚Äôve tried the REI Trail 25 on in-store and found it incredibly comfortable. I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs a bit delicate and not waterproof enough for living in the rainy Northwest of Lancaster/Cumbria. The Gregory Resin looks a little ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù for going to conferences and is more likely to help me out in rain. Because I‚Äôve one-bagged with as much as 20 lbs that needs to be taken into account as well (also need to just carry less). \n\nCrucial to me is the sternum strap, some back/shoulder paddding on straps etc, a water bottle pocket, and a large main compartment to take packing cubes/bags. My usual bag is a black Osprey Porter 30 but it‚Äôs too ‚Äúcinched down‚Äù for every day use and no water bottle pocket.

I tried the 26 as well and it was a bit too big (stuck out from my back too far). I like using the Resin 24 since I can pull out my packing cubes and use it as a daypack when I reach my destination. Main compartment is huge and just a giant bucket so you can fit a lot in there! The exterior is very durable and water resistant (haven't tried it in a downpour, but it's fine for drizzles I'd imagine). Fits under the seat of any airline I've tried.\n\nIt's very comfortable for regular usage and walking around (10 mile days, including many miles fully packed on the way to/from the airport). Wasn't as comfortable to use when biking, but I didn't get it for that purpose. The back panel has ventilation so my back stayed dry. It fits under the seat on airlines and the way it zips up with the gussets helps compress your stuff even more. I've taken it to Alaska, Michigan, and Minneapolis so far. Haven't tried the Trail 25, but the Resin 24 checked all of my marks!\n\nOne note is that I don't usually bring a laptop, so I wanted a bag with minimal laptop space but that still had a compartment just in case. With a laptop it would get a bit more snug inside but the laptop would be right next to your back which is nice for weight distribution. Good luck!",

To be clear, I don‚Äôt own one, but just checked it out based on another Reddit post, and it has the same problem I see with a lot of bags in this space in term of airflow and padding on the back.\n\nAs someone with lower back pain, and who perspires easily, I don‚Äôt think this bag would work for me ‚Äî although I‚Äôd love a Patagonia bag as a travel daypack. I‚Äôve already returned the Black Hole 25L because of this factor, and the fact that that pack won‚Äôt stand up when put down due to the sharp angle on the bottom. It looks like this bag at least avoids that standup problem.\n\nOne of the reasons I stick with Osprey Daylite Plus is that its AIRSPEED back panel is much better. Similarly I have both a Gregory Nano 20 Plus and a Nano 22 H2O which have better back panels. None of these will compare to my Osprey Talon 22, but they are all lighter and pack into my carry-on easier than the Talon 22.\n\nI really do wish Patagonia would make a relatively light daypack with good backpanel support.\n\nI think the next bag I try in this range will be one of the Decathlon Quechua MH-series 20L packs.",
