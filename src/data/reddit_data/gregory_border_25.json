The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff!

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

On paper, these are two very similar bags, and seem in a lot of ways to be pretty competitive (size, price, features).  Summary below:\n\n* **Looks:**  Cause we all care, right?  Well for me its the Patagonia hands-down.  I got the Smolder Blue, which is actually a dark grey with some contrasting black parts.  Not a fan of the huge lettering on it, but otherwise it looks slick, with contrast stitching and a general premium look.  The Gregory isn't bad, but not a fan of the slick looking, plasticky nylon panel on the front, and its a more bulbous unstructured shape.\n* **Materials:**  Patagonia easily wins again here.  Both use a large amount of recycled materials.  The Patagonia seems sturdier and more refined, and the main panels resemble X-Pac while being bit more flexible and quieter, while the Gregory is more typical nylon of bags of this (or even a lower) range.  The Gregory has a front panel, that while its does look generally waterproof, looks and feels very cheap (but nearly as bad looking as the previous shiny Black Hole material).  Overall I would say the Gregory does not feel like a $130+ bag. Both have great zippers, although the Patagonia's are a bit smoother (Gregory is YYK, but seem maybe too small for the pack).  Both have back panels that look good for airflow, but again the Gregory just looks/feels cheaper and I would be concerned with it snagging or generally not holding up as well.\n* **Size:**  Both are great, and wouldn't have concerns about be used for personal carry-on (except for some smaller Euro airlines, as both are hair over 18\" tall).  Main compartment on the Gregory seems much bigger though, with easier access\n* **Organization:** Gregory is the clear winner here.  Neither have a ton, but Gregory provides some nice features without overdoing it.  The vertical pocket has an internal mesh pocket to keep things a bit more organized, and few pens holders, and a few internal pockets.  It also has a top pocket with a nice felt lining (Patagonia is just more nylon).  The main compartment feels a bit Tardisy, as it seems huge, with a whipe open and easy access.  The Patagonia has literally nothing except one, kinda flimsy mesh pocket in the main (and only) compartment.  Which leads to, no separate laptop compartment on the Black Hole.  Usually not a big issue for me, but it hurts it here, especially since the one the Black Hole does have, is just sloppy and flimsy feeling.  With the lack of any frame, it also just makes things a bit challenging when packing fuller.\n* **Carry:**  Well here is where the Patagonia fails for me, and kinda hard.  It has no structure... at all. Essentially think of this bag as a duffel, with a decent harness system tacked on.  The back panel is simple, thin foam with no rigidity, or even particularly cushioned.  That means with anything in the pack (and especially in you don't have a laptop) it causes the back panel to bulge out and into your back.  Using one strap cause the whole bag to sag and bend along the back panel as well.  Both have great straps, although the Gregory's are a bit thicker and wider, but again has a cheaper feel with its mesh material.  Patagonia straps were also a bit more flexible, and more cushiony feeling.\n* **Misc:** Both have luggage pass-throughs, which is great.  However the Gregory, because it goes behind the rigid back panel, makes it a tight fit for large roller bag handles (my Travelpro roller handle barely fit, and was a bit of a fight to get it off.  The Patagonia pass-through handle has a bit a stretch, which is nice.  Both have external bottle pockets (Patagonia 2, Gregory 1).  Both nice a stretchy, but the Gregory has a bit more room.  A 32 oz Hydro would be pretty tight in the Patagonia.  The Gregory also has a side handle, which is pretty handy.\n\nOverall:  Well neither of these are keepers for me, which is sad because they are both so close.  The lack of a frame/structure in the Patagonia is a no-go for me, especially at that size (and price), and getting a duffel makes more sense.  A few extra pockets would also greatly help it out.  The Gregory is a much better designed bag in almost every way, but the materials just seem cheap and I would be worried about durability.  If it was an $80 bag I think it would be great, so maybe on sale?",
