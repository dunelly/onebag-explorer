            "body": "This is the backpack I use for work, but I don’t have the leather version, and mine is a few years old. Not sure if there have been changes. \n\nThings I carry in it: Laptop, IPad, leather portfolio, a few notebooks, a book, my purse, epipen, wireless headphones, a sweater, a rain jacket, charger cords, mouse and keyboard, and pens/pencils. \n\n\nPros: \n1) Easy access when opened from the top. \n2) The mesh pocket on the inside of the top flat is perfect for storing small cables (phones and tablets - my laptop’s charger would be too heavy) and pencils. If you aren’t worried about your pens leaking (I am) it’s great for that too.\n3) Laptop compartment is large enough for my work laptop (17in) and an iPad. I keep my laptop in a soft sleeve for a little extra protection, but my iPad is only in a normal protective case. \n4) Isn’t showing signs of wear after several years. \n\n\nPros/Cons External Pockets: \n1) Front pockets: \n1a) The small narrow horizontal pocket across the front is the PERFECT size for my epipen. I have an “epipen” tag on that zipper and it’s easy access. \n1b) That pocket isn’t a great size for anything else. I can fit my work badge in it, or my keys, or a couple pens. It’s too small for any of my glasses cases. \n2) Larger front pocket towards the bottom: it’s great for small thin items, but not for much else. \n3) Bottle pockets on the side: My everyday water bottle (owala 32oz) doesn’t fit without putting stress on the zippers. A 16oz soda bottle does fit. I mostly use them for things like pens.\n\n\nCon: The major con for me is the weight distribution on the straps for longer distances. The weight is primarily towards the top of the straps instead of being more evenly distributed. It’s not a problem for short distances, but it’s not comfortable for long distances. I do use forearm crutches with a swing through gait, so that does change how backpacks move, but I don’t have that problem with my osprey backpacks or my northside backpack, even though I rarely use their front straps. I’m the right height for the backpack and the straps are adjusted correctly.",

It was a great bag that I hauled all over North/Central America and Europe.\n\nThings I liked:\n\n* Great Build Quality\n* Looked good\n* Sensible organization/pockets\n* Could stuff it pretty full and didn't worry about zipper issues\n* Fit under the seat in every plane I was on\n\nOver time, I changed my packing style and I came to dislike the amount of pockets/organization in the bag. It felt like I was being constrained and I couldn't put a packing cube with a few days of clothes in in. I have since moved on to a GR1 and will probably get a 34L GR3 if Goruck ever drops one.\n\nIn the end I would say if this is your day to day, take it to the office bag, it is fantastic and will last you a long time (probably long enough to justify most of that price tag). If you do a lot of travel and live out of your backpack, you should consider continuing your search.\n\nBest of luck on your backpack journey!",

In comes my wife who seems to sometimes think that our checking account just runs on a loop haha.\n\nAs to your question, I don't think there's any special feature that you won't find in another bag. First off, it's huge. It fits everything I've ever tried to put into it when commuting. The way every comportment is designed is excellent. All of the secondary compartments are large and fit way more than you expect. Everything is designed such that nothing falls out if a zipper is left open. Even the large side pockets have an interior wall for expansion but large water bottles won't fall out (1L bottle fits but won't zip up, anything smaller zips up). There's just compartments within compartments and they all allow for amazing organization. And none of this touches on the excellent quality of the materials, zippers, straps, etc. It maintains it's shape no matter what's in it, is very comfortable to wear whether with a t-shirt or winter jacket and has a very comfortable top handle. My only regret is that I didn't get in monogrammed because I wasn't sure I'd keep it given the cost. Once I started commuting with it I knew there's no way I'm giving it up.",

Otherwise I love the bag and even with that gripe I will be keeping the bag and using it for the foreseeable future. \n\n(Not now, but normally), I travel for work about 250 days a year and consult with the fortune 1000 and global governments regarding tech strategy, data strategy and digital transformation. I give you this information to provide context to my review. \n\n1.  It looks professional. This is not rare, but is a plus in my mind.  It is the standard “business traveler” bag and every security and airport/airline employee recognizes this. If you travel a lot thus helps in subtle ways.\n\n2.  It is well organized. I love pockets and organizers more than I should, but all of them add weight and change the structure of the bag.  The Tumi has a great balance between structure and lack thereof.\n\n3.  Just big enough that fully packed it is not too heavy. I have a tendency to carry too much crap. I’ve done a decent job of reducing what I carry to what I think is reasonable - and if I drop a couple of the things I take on planes I have enough space to put two standard liquor bottles in the bag along with my work EDC and tablet. This has come in handy more than once.\n\nI use Briggs and Riley suitcases (really just one) and can do 30 days in a suit with my roller bag and backpack.  I’ve spent a lot of time figuring out what works best and what doesn’t. I’ve gone through at least 30 bags and 10 suitcases to get to what works for me.  Could I improve it, maybe, but I’m not even looking right now. \n\nHappy to answer any questions or go into detail on exactly how, what and why.",

I always found the luggage tag thing kinda cool though, maybe that's why I bought the backpack in the first place. Otherwise I'm not really that amazed by the backpack in general. Therefore I returned it.\n\nI ended up adding the AER day pack to my collection. I kinda like that subtle style more.",
