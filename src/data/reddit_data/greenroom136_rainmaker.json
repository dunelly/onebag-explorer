            "body": "***Final Edit:*** *While the form factor and pocket solutions were all great, I ended up selling this pack as it's base weight was a little too much for me. Greenroom136's great build quality works very much so for their slings, but when trying to take this overseas or walking for 4-5 hrs, the weight just felt a bit much. The straps and back cushions are very comfortable and help the bag feel lighter than it really is for what it's worth.*\n\n*Also the weight is comparable to many 20-30L travel bags out there. I just don't think 1000D Cordura is needed for anyone who isn't military or hiking up a mountain where the chance of rough abrasion could tear through a bag. I think the bag will work for someone who doesn't mind the extra weight or is just flat out stronger than me.*\n\n*The vision behind an overbuilt, carefully thought out bag, with pockets that are useful for both a work commute and conversion into a hiking pack, is definitely there. It is just far too heavy for me. Maybe if it comes out in 500D Cordura or even lighter 600D polyester, I'll give it a go again.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot my Northseeker and am about to test it out daily!\n\nFirst things first, I do not recommend the CT Small Pocket in any way shape or form, even if it was free. The wallet was put together so badly it came in a parrallelogram shape rather than a rectangle. The outside pockets also drop card, a small pocket knife, and was basically unusable for anything. I had mine refunded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker impressions:\n\n* This bag is heavy. Heavier than the Alpaka Elements and the CT15 which are both over a kilo each.\n* Straps are padded well and help distribute the weight evenly across the back. But hiking pack ergonomic it is not.\n* It feels leagues tankier than the CT15 which is already quite a sturdy bag. I would be happy with this even as a pack in the army.\n* The bottle pockets are not very useful due to them being too slim and not stretchy in any way. Fits a foldable umbrella and powerbank for charging as I walk comfortably however.\n* LOTS of pockets is definitely useful for a longer overseas trip. I can comfortably fit an M or L packing cube, underwear packing cube, tablet and water in this.\n* I like it a lot but damn this weight is definitely not for 4hr walks or touring the city. I would probably unload more than half it's weight when I am overseas however, as it is slim and good looking enough when mostly empty.\n* Loved the hidden passport pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker vs CT15:\n\n* Different volume for different needs. The CT15 is a beautiful bag for EDC or office work. However it has much narrower shoulder straps and is definitely less comfortable. It is lighter which can make it comfortable as well, but if fully loaded with heavy items? I don't like it that much. The Northseeker is definitely a better bag for travel or larger volume carry. Expecting it to be an office EDC bag without customizing some aspects or adding a laptop sleeve is going to leave you disappointed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The Northseeker is a rugged, comfortable carry. It is not a pack you hike with for 4hrs plus or designed as an office bag in it's stock configuration. It's a bag you add things to, use pouches and packing cubes for and plan equipment around. It doesn't have a dedicated camera slot, sunglasses slot or laptop sleeve. You have to add and play around with it's clamshell. And I think that is it's most charming factor. It is a manybaggers tinkering dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I do not miss the tablet sleeve on the CT15 either. Found that that wasted tablet pocket volume could have been added into the main volume since the CT15 already has a great sleeve INSIDE the main pocket. I find that the Northseeker is the bag for someone carrying a lot of clothes. I don't want a large laptop sleeve pocket taking up bag volume, especially when I travel, I am trusting my laptop cover folder much more than any bag's sleeve. I *don't think a laptop sleeve or key leash is needed in any bag* and I will die on this hill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I like it but I don't think it is suitable for everyday light carry. Like the Metrorunner I think it suits rugged folk, or folk would work longer hours and carry more. For me, I keep gym clothes and a shoebag inside it for when I need. And still have the front organiser pocket for my tablet, chargers or laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This is a better option compared to the Rainmaker for me as I always felt that huge laptop pocket was just too wasteful in terms of volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* There are lighter options for both a 15L and 20L bags. When you buy Greenroom I feel you are paying for something quite durable. Suits someone who is going from plane to hotel, workplace to workplace. Maybe not mountain to mountain. On dayhikes I am definitely not using this. I will be going to cheap, ripstop bag from Outdoor Products which barely cost me $40.\n* The straps on the Northseeker are much wider, making them more comfortable. While there's padding on the back, there is very little ventilation making the Northseeker quite a warm bag.",

Like the Metrorunner I think it suits rugged folk, or folk would work longer hours and carry more. For me, I keep gym clothes and a shoebag inside it for when I need. And still have the front organiser pocket for my tablet, chargers or laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This is a better option compared to the Rainmaker for me as I always felt that huge laptop pocket was just too wasteful in terms of volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* There are lighter options for both a 15L and 20L bags. When you buy Greenroom I feel you are paying for something quite durable. Suits someone who is going from plane to hotel, workplace to workplace. Maybe not mountain to mountain. On dayhikes I am definitely not using this. I will be going to cheap, ripstop bag from Outdoor Products which barely cost me $40.\n* The straps on the Northseeker are much wider, making them more comfortable. While there's padding on the back, there is very little ventilation making the Northseeker quite a warm bag.",

            "body": "***Final Edit:*** *While the form factor and pocket solutions were all great, I ended up selling this pack as it's base weight was a little too much for me. Greenroom136's great build quality works very much so for their slings, but when trying to take this overseas or walking for 4-5 hrs, the weight just felt a bit much. The straps and back cushions are very comfortable and help the bag feel lighter than it really is for what it's worth.*\n\n*Also the weight is comparable to many 20-30L travel bags out there. I just don't think 1000D Cordura is needed for anyone who isn't military or hiking up a mountain where the chance of rough abrasion could tear through a bag. I think the bag will work for someone who doesn't mind the extra weight or is just flat out stronger than me.*\n\n*The vision behind an overbuilt, carefully thought out bag, with pockets that are useful for both a work commute and conversion into a hiking pack, is definitely there. It is just far too heavy for me. Maybe if it comes out in 500D Cordura or even lighter 600D polyester, I'll give it a go again.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot my Northseeker and am about to test it out daily!\n\nFirst things first, I do not recommend the CT Small Pocket in any way shape or form, even if it was free. The wallet was put together so badly it came in a parrallelogram shape rather than a rectangle. The outside pockets also drop card, a small pocket knife, and was basically unusable for anything. I had mine refunded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker impressions:\n\n* This bag is heavy. Heavier than the Alpaka Elements and the CT15 which are both over a kilo each.\n* Straps are padded well and help distribute the weight evenly across the back. But hiking pack ergonomic it is not.\n* It feels leagues tankier than the CT15 which is already quite a sturdy bag. I would be happy with this even as a pack in the army.\n* The bottle pockets are not very useful due to them being too slim and not stretchy in any way. Fits a foldable umbrella and powerbank for charging as I walk comfortably however.\n* LOTS of pockets is definitely useful for a longer overseas trip. I can comfortably fit an M or L packing cube, underwear packing cube, tablet and water in this.\n* I like it a lot but damn this weight is definitely not for 4hr walks or touring the city. I would probably unload more than half it's weight when I am overseas however, as it is slim and good looking enough when mostly empty.\n* Loved the hidden passport pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker vs CT15:\n\n* Different volume for different needs. The CT15 is a beautiful bag for EDC or office work. However it has much narrower shoulder straps and is definitely less comfortable. It is lighter which can make it comfortable as well, but if fully loaded with heavy items? I don't like it that much. The Northseeker is definitely a better bag for travel or larger volume carry. Expecting it to be an office EDC bag without customizing some aspects or adding a laptop sleeve is going to leave you disappointed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The Northseeker is a rugged, comfortable carry. It is not a pack you hike with for 4hrs plus or designed as an office bag in it's stock configuration. It's a bag you add things to, use pouches and packing cubes for and plan equipment around. It doesn't have a dedicated camera slot, sunglasses slot or laptop sleeve. You have to add and play around with it's clamshell. And I think that is it's most charming factor. It is a manybaggers tinkering dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I do not miss the tablet sleeve on the CT15 either. Found that that wasted tablet pocket volume could have been added into the main volume since the CT15 already has a great sleeve INSIDE the main pocket. I find that the Northseeker is the bag for someone carrying a lot of clothes. I don't want a large laptop sleeve pocket taking up bag volume, especially when I travel, I am trusting my laptop cover folder much more than any bag's sleeve. I *don't think a laptop sleeve or key leash is needed in any bag* and I will die on this hill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I like it but I don't think it is suitable for everyday light carry. Like the Metrorunner I think it suits rugged folk, or folk would work longer hours and carry more. For me, I keep gym clothes and a shoebag inside it for when I need. And still have the front organiser pocket for my tablet, chargers or laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This is a better option compared to the Rainmaker for me as I always felt that huge laptop pocket was just too wasteful in terms of volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* There are lighter options for both a 15L and 20L bags.

            "body": "***Final Edit:*** *While the form factor and pocket solutions were all great, I ended up selling this pack as it's base weight was a little too much for me. Greenroom136's great build quality works very much so for their slings, but when trying to take this overseas or walking for 4-5 hrs, the weight just felt a bit much. The straps and back cushions are very comfortable and help the bag feel lighter than it really is for what it's worth.*\n\n*Also the weight is comparable to many 20-30L travel bags out there. I just don't think 1000D Cordura is needed for anyone who isn't military or hiking up a mountain where the chance of rough abrasion could tear through a bag. I think the bag will work for someone who doesn't mind the extra weight or is just flat out stronger than me.*\n\n*The vision behind an overbuilt, carefully thought out bag, with pockets that are useful for both a work commute and conversion into a hiking pack, is definitely there. It is just far too heavy for me. Maybe if it comes out in 500D Cordura or even lighter 600D polyester, I'll give it a go again.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot my Northseeker and am about to test it out daily!\n\nFirst things first, I do not recommend the CT Small Pocket in any way shape or form, even if it was free. The wallet was put together so badly it came in a parrallelogram shape rather than a rectangle. The outside pockets also drop card, a small pocket knife, and was basically unusable for anything. I had mine refunded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker impressions:\n\n* This bag is heavy. Heavier than the Alpaka Elements and the CT15 which are both over a kilo each.\n* Straps are padded well and help distribute the weight evenly across the back. But hiking pack ergonomic it is not.\n* It feels leagues tankier than the CT15 which is already quite a sturdy bag. I would be happy with this even as a pack in the army.\n* The bottle pockets are not very useful due to them being too slim and not stretchy in any way. Fits a foldable umbrella and powerbank for charging as I walk comfortably however.\n* LOTS of pockets is definitely useful for a longer overseas trip. I can comfortably fit an M or L packing cube, underwear packing cube, tablet and water in this.\n* I like it a lot but damn this weight is definitely not for 4hr walks or touring the city. I would probably unload more than half it's weight when I am overseas however, as it is slim and good looking enough when mostly empty.\n* Loved the hidden passport pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker vs CT15:\n\n* Different volume for different needs. The CT15 is a beautiful bag for EDC or office work. However it has much narrower shoulder straps and is definitely less comfortable. It is lighter which can make it comfortable as well, but if fully loaded with heavy items? I don't like it that much. The Northseeker is definitely a better bag for travel or larger volume carry. Expecting it to be an office EDC bag without customizing some aspects or adding a laptop sleeve is going to leave you disappointed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The Northseeker is a rugged, comfortable carry. It is not a pack you hike with for 4hrs plus or designed as an office bag in it's stock configuration. It's a bag you add things to, use pouches and packing cubes for and plan equipment around. It doesn't have a dedicated camera slot, sunglasses slot or laptop sleeve. You have to add and play around with it's clamshell. And I think that is it's most charming factor. It is a manybaggers tinkering dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I do not miss the tablet sleeve on the CT15 either. Found that that wasted tablet pocket volume could have been added into the main volume since the CT15 already has a great sleeve INSIDE the main pocket. I find that the Northseeker is the bag for someone carrying a lot of clothes. I don't want a large laptop sleeve pocket taking up bag volume, especially when I travel, I am trusting my laptop cover folder much more than any bag's sleeve. I *don't think a laptop sleeve or key leash is needed in any bag* and I will die on this hill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I like it but I don't think it is suitable for everyday light carry. Like the Metrorunner I think it suits rugged folk, or folk would work longer hours and carry more. For me, I keep gym clothes and a shoebag inside it for when I need. And still have the front organiser pocket for my tablet, chargers or laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This is a better option compared to the Rainmaker for me as I always felt that huge laptop pocket was just too wasteful in terms of volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* There are lighter options for both a 15L and 20L bags. When you buy Greenroom I feel you are paying for something quite durable. Suits someone who is going from plane to hotel, workplace to workplace. Maybe not mountain to mountain. On dayhikes I am definitely not using this. I will be going to cheap, ripstop bag from Outdoor Products which barely cost me $40.\n* The straps on the Northseeker are much wider, making them more comfortable. While there's padding on the back, there is very little ventilation making the Northseeker quite a warm bag.",

But hiking pack ergonomic it is not.\n* It feels leagues tankier than the CT15 which is already quite a sturdy bag. I would be happy with this even as a pack in the army.\n* The bottle pockets are not very useful due to them being too slim and not stretchy in any way. Fits a foldable umbrella and powerbank for charging as I walk comfortably however.\n* LOTS of pockets is definitely useful for a longer overseas trip. I can comfortably fit an M or L packing cube, underwear packing cube, tablet and water in this.\n* I like it a lot but damn this weight is definitely not for 4hr walks or touring the city. I would probably unload more than half it's weight when I am overseas however, as it is slim and good looking enough when mostly empty.\n* Loved the hidden passport pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker vs CT15:\n\n* Different volume for different needs. The CT15 is a beautiful bag for EDC or office work. However it has much narrower shoulder straps and is definitely less comfortable. It is lighter which can make it comfortable as well, but if fully loaded with heavy items? I don't like it that much. The Northseeker is definitely a better bag for travel or larger volume carry. Expecting it to be an office EDC bag without customizing some aspects or adding a laptop sleeve is going to leave you disappointed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The Northseeker is a rugged, comfortable carry. It is not a pack you hike with for 4hrs plus or designed as an office bag in it's stock configuration. It's a bag you add things to, use pouches and packing cubes for and plan equipment around. It doesn't have a dedicated camera slot, sunglasses slot or laptop sleeve. You have to add and play around with it's clamshell. And I think that is it's most charming factor. It is a manybaggers tinkering dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I do not miss the tablet sleeve on the CT15 either. Found that that wasted tablet pocket volume could have been added into the main volume since the CT15 already has a great sleeve INSIDE the main pocket. I find that the Northseeker is the bag for someone carrying a lot of clothes. I don't want a large laptop sleeve pocket taking up bag volume, especially when I travel, I am trusting my laptop cover folder much more than any bag's sleeve. I *don't think a laptop sleeve or key leash is needed in any bag* and I will die on this hill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I like it but I don't think it is suitable for everyday light carry. Like the Metrorunner I think it suits rugged folk, or folk would work longer hours and carry more. For me, I keep gym clothes and a shoebag inside it for when I need. And still have the front organiser pocket for my tablet, chargers or laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This is a better option compared to the Rainmaker for me as I always felt that huge laptop pocket was just too wasteful in terms of volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* There are lighter options for both a 15L and 20L bags. When you buy Greenroom I feel you are paying for something quite durable. Suits someone who is going from plane to hotel, workplace to workplace. Maybe not mountain to mountain. On dayhikes I am definitely not using this. I will be going to cheap, ripstop bag from Outdoor Products which barely cost me $40.\n* The straps on the Northseeker are much wider, making them more comfortable. While there's padding on the back, there is very little ventilation making the Northseeker quite a warm bag.",

            "body": "***Final Edit:*** *While the form factor and pocket solutions were all great, I ended up selling this pack as it's base weight was a little too much for me. Greenroom136's great build quality works very much so for their slings, but when trying to take this overseas or walking for 4-5 hrs, the weight just felt a bit much. The straps and back cushions are very comfortable and help the bag feel lighter than it really is for what it's worth.*\n\n*Also the weight is comparable to many 20-30L travel bags out there. I just don't think 1000D Cordura is needed for anyone who isn't military or hiking up a mountain where the chance of rough abrasion could tear through a bag. I think the bag will work for someone who doesn't mind the extra weight or is just flat out stronger than me.*\n\n*The vision behind an overbuilt, carefully thought out bag, with pockets that are useful for both a work commute and conversion into a hiking pack, is definitely there. It is just far too heavy for me. Maybe if it comes out in 500D Cordura or even lighter 600D polyester, I'll give it a go again.*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGot my Northseeker and am about to test it out daily!\n\nFirst things first, I do not recommend the CT Small Pocket in any way shape or form, even if it was free. The wallet was put together so badly it came in a parrallelogram shape rather than a rectangle. The outside pockets also drop card, a small pocket knife, and was basically unusable for anything. I had mine refunded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker impressions:\n\n* This bag is heavy. Heavier than the Alpaka Elements and the CT15 which are both over a kilo each.\n* Straps are padded well and help distribute the weight evenly across the back. But hiking pack ergonomic it is not.\n* It feels leagues tankier than the CT15 which is already quite a sturdy bag. I would be happy with this even as a pack in the army.\n* The bottle pockets are not very useful due to them being too slim and not stretchy in any way. Fits a foldable umbrella and powerbank for charging as I walk comfortably however.\n* LOTS of pockets is definitely useful for a longer overseas trip. I can comfortably fit an M or L packing cube, underwear packing cube, tablet and water in this.\n* I like it a lot but damn this weight is definitely not for 4hr walks or touring the city. I would probably unload more than half it's weight when I am overseas however, as it is slim and good looking enough when mostly empty.\n* Loved the hidden passport pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNorthseeker vs CT15:\n\n* Different volume for different needs. The CT15 is a beautiful bag for EDC or office work. However it has much narrower shoulder straps and is definitely less comfortable. It is lighter which can make it comfortable as well, but if fully loaded with heavy items? I don't like it that much. The Northseeker is definitely a better bag for travel or larger volume carry. Expecting it to be an office EDC bag without customizing some aspects or adding a laptop sleeve is going to leave you disappointed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The Northseeker is a rugged, comfortable carry. It is not a pack you hike with for 4hrs plus or designed as an office bag in it's stock configuration. It's a bag you add things to, use pouches and packing cubes for and plan equipment around. It doesn't have a dedicated camera slot, sunglasses slot or laptop sleeve. You have to add and play around with it's clamshell. And I think that is it's most charming factor. It is a manybaggers tinkering dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I do not miss the tablet sleeve on the CT15 either. Found that that wasted tablet pocket volume could have been added into the main volume since the CT15 already has a great sleeve INSIDE the main pocket. I find that the Northseeker is the bag for someone carrying a lot of clothes. I don't want a large laptop sleeve pocket taking up bag volume, especially when I travel, I am trusting my laptop cover folder much more than any bag's sleeve. I *don't think a laptop sleeve or key leash is needed in any bag* and I will die on this hill.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I like it but I don't think it is suitable for everyday light carry. Like the Metrorunner I think it suits rugged folk, or folk would work longer hours and carry more. For me, I keep gym clothes and a shoebag inside it for when I need. And still have the front organiser pocket for my tablet, chargers or laptop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* This is a better option compared to the Rainmaker for me as I always felt that huge laptop pocket was just too wasteful in terms of volume.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* There are lighter options for both a 15L and 20L bags. When you buy Greenroom I feel you are paying for something quite durable. Suits someone who is going from plane to hotel, workplace to workplace. Maybe not mountain to mountain. On dayhikes I am definitely not using this. I will be going to cheap, ripstop bag from Outdoor Products which barely cost me $40.\n* The straps on the Northseeker are much wider, making them more comfortable. While there's padding on the back, there is very little ventilation making the Northseeker quite a warm bag.",

MHP was a bit too big for me and the CAS2 has no xpac version.\n\nIf you are thinking of getting these two from GR136, I say just get it!  You won’t regret it.  The Northseeker is built like a tank but the shoulder pada are super comfy!",

        "selftext": "So, I actually got this bag a couple weeks ago. This is the medium size, which is 22 liters. My first trip with it will be in a few days for a 12 day trip to see family in the southern part of the US. \n\n[Flopped open](https://i.imgur.com/mpLztHJ.jpg)\n\n[Piping detail](https://i.imgur.com/HEu8Nwr.jpg)\n\n[Packed, can of cider for scale (sorry, no banana)](https://i.imgur.com/ijyxEei.jpg)\n\n[On me, 5'1\", 115lbs](https://i.imgur.com/UySetlq.jpg) \n\n[Video review](https://youtu.be/SulHkMFCVJM)\n\nHonestly, my first impression of the bag is that it is over engineered. What do I mean by that? Basically, it has piping, it has thick outer fabric, it has a thick inner fabric, it has beefy zippers on the inside where you don't really need beefy zippers, the straps feel more hard than padded, there is padding on both the front and back parts of the laptop sleeve in addition to even more padding on the back of the bag (double padding all the way). It *is* a very heavy bag, almost 3.5lbs. That being said, it does feel like it is going to last a very long time. I think that after 5 years of heavy use, it is going to be nice and supple and very comfortable and easily last another 25 years. It's not uncomfortable right now, but I definitely see it getting more comfortable with use (I even say in my video review that it feels almost pillowy). Is it *the* perfect bag? No. But honestly, my biggest complaints are that it is stiff and heavy, and the stiffness will go away with use. Fully packed out, it weighs almost 15lbs. Without the laptop, I can get it closer to 10. Heavy for me, but probably not that heavy for the vast majority of people in this sub? \n\nI plan to make another post and video after the trip to give my impressions of actually using the bag in the wild!",

I now have the bag I’ve been looking over a year for..\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/gMpbR0w\n\nA Greenroom136 Rainmaker 2.1 X-PAC VX42 Limited Edition size Large.\nCustom built by Greenroom136 and further customized by me. \n(I removed the wall between the laptop clamshell and main compartment in order to have one big main compartment with a clamshell opening).\n\nI wanted a backpack that was built like a tank and would work as an EDC pack, carry on compatible, and also from time to time double as a camera backpack.\nWeatherproof, stealthy design, clamshell opening. And not look like your average camera backpack..\n\nThere are lots of backpacks from various companies that fits this description - sort of..\nBut I always found something wrong with the different packs. \nFor example, lots of clever clamshell backpacks has the “lid” part of the clam outwards. Which means that you have to put the straps and that whole side that goes towards your body on the ground that might be wet or muddy or snowy or dusty or whatever.. this will stick to the mesh of the back and then transfer to your clothing.\n\nI’ve read that people think it’s a bit heavy, but that doesn’t bother me since most camera backpacks out there are on the heavier side. \nFor me heavy duty materials means good quality and will protect my gear well.\nAnd to be honest, it’s not that heavy imo.\n\nI’ve written some info in the imgur gallery. \nBut basically, I removed the wall between the laptop compartment and the main.\nIn order to fit a RCI (removable camera insert) deep enough to hold a DSLR with grip and lens attached.\nThe result is similar to a Goruck main compartment. And also being able to have a clamshell opening while keeping the bottle pockets on each side (this isn’t possible with the options on the Greenroom136 site).\n\nPat was super helpful and had great patience with my questions before I finally placed the order.\n\nI asked to swap the top mesh pocket for three rows of molle webbing which was no problem.\nInitially I also asked Greenroom136 if they could not sew in the wall from the get go, and also not have the main compartment zipper sewn in. \nBut since this would deviate too much from their iconic Rainmaker design they respectfully declined my request. \nI respect that and this was definitely not a dealbreaker for me. I figured I could remove the wall on my own. \nInstead, I opted for the rain flap on that zipper only, just to hide it a bit.\nAnd the non-clamshell zipper is still nice to have for an easier way of retrieve things from the top. Super happy with the result!\n\nDimensions of and link to the RCI:\n\nhttps://nya-evo.eu/collections/all-products/products/rci-m\n\nDimensions (external): 29 (W) x 28 (H) x 16.5 (D) cm / 11.4 (W) x 11 (H) x 6.5 (D) in\nDimensions (internal): 27 (W) x 26 (H) x 15.5 (D) cm / 10.6 (W) x 10.2 (H) x 6.1 (D) in\n\n\nLink to Greenroom136:\n\nhttps://www.greenroom136.com/shop/W-ldcard-Rainmaker-2-1-VX42-Edition-p155657161\n\nIt’s the community of r/backpacks with all the different takes on what’s good, inspiring posts, and rants. That helped me to find what I was looking for.\nSo with this post I’d like to pay back and hopefully help some of you in your quest to find what’s right for you.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions or provide more info upon request.\n\nEdit: To clarify a few sentences.",

Then I used a lighter to burn / melt the threads and whatever else that was sticking out. It came out better than I had hoped for, but if you look close you can definitely see that something has been done to it. But it’s only on the inside of the bag so it doesn’t matter to me at all.\n\n1. A mix between getting a more water resistant bottom and front of the bag, to give the bag a more tech look, and also because I’m a bit tired of the cordura look, wanted to try something that is new (to me).\n\n2. Not really. Both of the materials they use are heavy duty and pretty much overkill for what 99% of their customers probably needs (1000 denier cordura or x-pac vx42), but it’s fun knowing that it really can take a beating.. \nI think it compresses nicely and the difference might be next to none.\n\n\n3. I’ve never used fidlock sliders before (never used any fidlocks at all before) and I’m not going to lie, it took some time to get used to. I’d say they are about as fast (if you practice a bit) to open with one hand as regular buckles. But much faster and easier to close with one hand, you just have to sort of bring them closer to each other and they’ll snap in place. It’s to the point where they sometimes snap back into place on their own when they dangle too close to each other..\nSo counting the time for both opening and closing - fidlock will win!\n\n4. The X-PAC doesn’t feel abrasive at all, it seems to have less friction overall than cordura.\nI haven’t used the pack long enough or in warm climate yet to tell if the mesh will be abrasive against the skin or not. It doesn’t feel like it will be though.\nMaybe against certain clothing, I can imagine it being a bit abrasive against knitted sweaters of the thinner kind.",

My question is if this size would be fine enough for 3-5 day trips where I don't pay for a carryon?\n\nI pack very lightly and lots of my clothes and stuff are pretty light and compressible. I feel like I could make this work. Was wondering if anyone else does the same. Thanks! \n\n",

The main pocket and admin pockets have small quick access pockets that i used for a toothbrush kit, shavers, face creams and sunscreen. \n\n\nThe admin pocket was just for a tablet/laptop and electronics. The big front vertical pocket i placed a small sling in for when i left the big bag in the room. \n\n\nI'd say go for it. Just that fully packing the full 25L made this bag heavy.

        "selftext": "There's a pocket for everything ... if it were custom made for my items, it couldn't be a more precise fit. And that's good because there's no space to waste here because of the size of my items vs the typical personal item sizer which I call 40x30x20cm. Reviews and videos of this bag are plentiful so I will focus just on my stuff.\n\nThe Dasung not-eReader fits the mesh pouch zipper in the main compartment as if it were tailored for it: https://i.imgur.com/vMAAOVa.jpg\n\nWhat about the tablet pocket? Yup, neat fit for the PackedPixel: https://i.imgur.com/ZCBv9sa.jpg\n\nCan we find a pocket for the AS-240 charger, chunky as it is? https://i.imgur.com/LNRIAxM.jpg this is so precise a fit if you let it drop inside it snags on the gusset coming out which would be finicky but luckily enough I can drop my DC extender to the bottom of the pocket https://i.imgur.com/jDrezHs.jpg which neatly keeps the AS-240 sticking out like this. Here's the entire panel: https://i.imgur.com/E1VoVF6.jpg\n\nI posted a total parts list as the top comment in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/pog7ph/x1_extreme_gen_4_spreads_its_wings/). As you can see the rest is nothing, all the big items are packed -- and we didn't even use the front pockets yet.\n\nOr the MOLLE pouches to come. https://i.imgur.com/P6Bks14.jpg replacing the slip pocket with more MOLLE is not a standard option but all it took was a quick chat over Messenger. They are custom built anyways so why not? It will be paired with the Helikon-Tex Pakcell cubes that /u/monsurjaya [suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/qf8q03/packing_cube_with_molle/hhybo78/). These are not here currently -- they are waiting for me at my parents in Hungary -- it was way cheaper than buying in North America and I am going to be there soon enough (after two years!).\n\nThere has been a slight mishap and the removable laptop sleeve indeed got removed so right now I only have https://i.imgur.com/RNGLIKk.jpg but ~~they told me they will send it over~~ it is already on the way. I am not fazed much, I wanted a removable sleeve anyways because my laptop is unusual sized -- that's why I bought it, finally a 16:10 ThinkPad -- and I am not sure whether it'll fit theirs anyways. Removable laptop sleeve is also a chat only customization option.\n\nContigo West Loop in the outer pocket, https://i.imgur.com/Qnq89Vo.jpg https://i.imgur.com/LQAg8Ou.jpg nice and snug. If you look closely, the last photo shows the characteristic X-Pac diamond pattern. Yup, this entire backpack is made from VX42. What can I do, I am in love with X-Pac ever since 1733 made me a half Cordura, half VX21 [shoulder bag](https://imgur.com/a/xmRmYSn). The VX42 is _much_ sturdier than the 21, that's for sure.\n\nWith the recent [InUSA roller](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/qwjgln/inusa_15_wheeled_underseat/), I have two personal item sizer bags to ensure no weird airlines will mess with me. Clothes in the roller, electronics in the backpack, all good. (Corendon Airlines? Even I never flew with them before.)",

            "body": "So far really loving this bag after first week of use.\n \nPROS: \n\nNeat, well-structured design means even when the bag is full, it doesn't get difficult to carry. The solid structure makes the load-bearing very efficient.\n\nFidlocks work great and I like the sliding fidlock on the chest stabiliser strap. \n\nCambuckle is very handy once you get used to it. There is definitely a knack to it. I find that I'm adjusting the strap a little lower than I thought I would; the bag sits nicely in the middle of my back rather than higher up, where I might want to situate my other recent purchase, the LBB Echelon.\n\nInterior pockets are just right, sturdy enough to hold my power bank and cables etc. The side pockets for water bottles are *great*, although it won't fit my taller Chilly's water bottle.\n\nThe laptop sleeve is excellent - perfect for my Pixelbook, and the corduroy lining is a lovely touch. I don't feel the need to have another layer of protection for my laptop, which is actually a first for me (and I've had a lot of bags over the years). \n\nTwo additional document/tablet slots either side of the padded laptop section. Fantastic. Also a nice pocket at the front that fits a paperback or whatever. \n\nI opted for the top zip opening for easy access to the laptop section,  definitely a good choice. Going through the wildcard options took me quite a while, but it was worth it. The colour scheme is custom, and I really love the dark brown. \n\nCONS: \n\nI think I would prefer to have a wider shoulder strap with a quick release, but the cambuckle means that you can always loosen the strap all the way so the bag goes over the head easily. \n\nI believe that GR136 do a quick release strap on one of their other bag designs, so I'm going to email them about this. If I can get a bootstrap with a quick release strap, they might as well TAKE MY MONEY NOW. I'd happily order another of these bags.\n\nQuick access zipper is great, but I wonder if there would be issues with waterproofing. Not such an issue for me, but maybe something to consider if you are going to be outdoors a lot with it (i.e. cycle commute). \n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nOverall, this is a BEAUTIFUL bag. It really appeals to my bag geek passion. Plenty of FUNCTIONAL pockets (oh, did I mention the secret document pocket under the back panel? (wildcard only)) that allow for good organisation of everyday items. Great weight distribution when full. Decent amount of space in the main section (yesterday I managed to add quite a few items when out shopping). Customer service was great helping me get the order finalised, and delivery was much faster than I expected. \n\nI hope that this company gets the support and praise it deserves. The closest comparison I can think of for form and function was my old Mountain Hardwear Paladin backpack. Hope this review was helpful!",

The Bootstrap is more of an EDC type bag, and the design doesn't accommodate the wider strap. The result is that they just designed two different bags. So the answer is, if you want the quick release buckle, get the Junkmonkey.",

If I feel like I can get away without using my stick, I can shorten it and strap it to the bottom of the bag. In terms of the cleaner look, I can't see it when it's on my back, so it hasn't been an issue! The fidlocks are great, and the pocket layout is really good. I can only compare to the LBB Echelon, which is a larger bag, with less organisation, so I tend to use my own EDC bags to keep things tidy in the Echelon.",

I keep waffling if I would actually use it.\n\nHave you used their other fidlocks? I keep reading the slides like you have don't orient similarly on both sides and is a bit confusing?\n\nDo you find the bottom compression straps prevent the bag from standing up in any situations? \n\nThanks!",

But I can answer a few of your questions.\n\nI have a 2016 15\" MBP.  It just fits in the sleeve.  And that just fit in the sleeve.  so anything larger would do best in the Large 27L version of the bag.  My cordura version is the 27L, and I was able to easily fit my large Dell laptop I had at that time.  \n\nJust playing around with the bag, I can say I love the peel over front pocket.  I really wish I had gone with it the first time I got a Rainmaker.  It really makes access into the pocket so much easier.  \n\nThe front slime pocket will be a great place to toss extra masks or some snacks for my daughter.  \n\nI had fidlocks on my first Rainmaker.  I didn't find them to be confusing at all.  they easily snap together or slide apart regardless of the side of the bag.  \n\nI should be putting the bag into rotation next week.  I'll be shooting my talking head for another bag review today, and EDCing it until I get all the B-roll shots I need.  Then this bag is next in line.",
