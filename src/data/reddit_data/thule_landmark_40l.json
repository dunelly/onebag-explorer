        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

The Gregory Border can be found in black for $189 on a handful of sites. I wasn't thrilled about the black, but saw that a site in the Netherlands called outdoorxl had the brown on sale.  After shipping (which only took 3 days!), the bag was about $209, so I figured what's $20 more if I like it better and it will last a long time.  Both bags used to be available in more colors.

        "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow bag ~~addicts~~ enthusiasts! I recently came across the Thule Subterra Hybrid 2 and was really taken with it as a potential flexible use personal-item sized bag. I didn‚Äôt see any review posts or anyone really mentioning it so I thought I‚Äôd post up with my first impressions having just gotten it in today. \n\nIt‚Äôs touted as expandable from a 15L pack to a 23L pack and has a full wrap around zip on the main clamshell compartment, which actually allows it to function similar to a compression packing cube if wanted.\nThe back pack straps can be stashed and it has a luggage pass through strap, which was one of my requirements.\nThere are two compartments: a clamshell open \n‚Äútravel pack‚Äù main open compartment, and a padded 3/4 zip panel compartment with organization for tech items including a laptop, tablet, charging cords, etc.\n\nI was surprised how much I could fit in the main travel section! I have a 4-day conference coming up at the end of May that I‚Äôm working on a capsule wardrobe for, and I fit just about everything in. I started with the compartment expanded and then zipped it up compression cube style after packing. I have more space to fill if I leave it expanded, and I haven‚Äôt loaded anything into the tech/organization side yet. It still feels like there‚Äôs plenty more room.\n\nWhat I fit so far:\nToiletry kit\nTravel hair care products \nSmall Orange packing cube has 2 bras and 4 pairs underware\n1 pair skinny jeans\n1 pair light weight capris(LLBean camping quick dry material)\n1 pair shorts\n3 tops\n1 tshirt &amp; 1 pair scrub pants for pjs\n\nI really like the size and weight, the material looks and feels good, and the large handles on the side let you carry it sort of briefcase style.\n\nI do wish it had a messenger bag like strap or attach points  for another carry option, but that‚Äôs a minor thing.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt have an external water bottle pocket, but currently with the bag not loaded to capacity you could fit one inside.\n\nI can report back after actually using it for travel, but so far I‚Äôm really pleased with my purchase. Hope these ramblings and pics are helpful for folks, particularly if you, like me, had tried to find commentary on this bag.",

        "selftext": "Hello fellow bag ~~addicts~~ enthusiasts! I recently came across the Thule Subterra Hybrid 2 and was really taken with it as a potential flexible use personal-item sized bag. I didn‚Äôt see any review posts or anyone really mentioning it so I thought I‚Äôd post up with my first impressions having just gotten it in today. \n\nIt‚Äôs touted as expandable from a 15L pack to a 23L pack and has a full wrap around zip on the main clamshell compartment, which actually allows it to function similar to a compression packing cube if wanted.\nThe back pack straps can be stashed and it has a luggage pass through strap, which was one of my requirements.\nThere are two compartments: a clamshell open \n‚Äútravel pack‚Äù main open compartment, and a padded 3/4 zip panel compartment with organization for tech items including a laptop, tablet, charging cords, etc.\n\nI was surprised how much I could fit in the main travel section! I have a 4-day conference coming up at the end of May that I‚Äôm working on a capsule wardrobe for, and I fit just about everything in. I started with the compartment expanded and then zipped it up compression cube style after packing. I have more space to fill if I leave it expanded, and I haven‚Äôt loaded anything into the tech/organization side yet. It still feels like there‚Äôs plenty more room.\n\nWhat I fit so far:\nToiletry kit\nTravel hair care products \nSmall Orange packing cube has 2 bras and 4 pairs underware\n1 pair skinny jeans\n1 pair light weight capris(LLBean camping quick dry material)\n1 pair shorts\n3 tops\n1 tshirt &amp; 1 pair scrub pants for pjs\n\nI really like the size and weight, the material looks and feels good, and the large handles on the side let you carry it sort of briefcase style.\n\nI do wish it had a messenger bag like strap or attach points  for another carry option, but that‚Äôs a minor thing.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt have an external water bottle pocket, but currently with the bag not loaded to capacity you could fit one inside.\n\nI can report back after actually using it for travel, but so far I‚Äôm really pleased with my purchase. Hope these ramblings and pics are helpful for folks, particularly if you, like me, had tried to find commentary on this bag.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jcopta/thule_landmark_40_review_after_3_weeks_in_mexico/",
        "selftext": "\nI love bags and don‚Äôt think you can have one that fits all your needs. So I was missing a bag to go one-bag traveling, as I really like the idea of not bringing a big hard suitcase and too much stuff. I have other bags for other needs, so my collection now fits most of my needs (things can always be improved, but I don‚Äôt like to spend money if I already have a bag that can fulfill +80% of the need).\n\nI chose the Landmark 40 as I wanted a carry-on size backpack for longer travels, and one I could use at home for weekend trips. I like gear and love to bring home souvenirs when traveling. I would rather have some empty space than fully pack my bag. I have seen a lot of nice reviews and comments about the ula Dragonfly, but the bag is too small for this kind of trip for me. Also, I don‚Äôt like the look of the ULA Camino, and since I live in Denmark, it is expensive to buy.\n\nI have been looking at more than 50 bags and narrowed down the list of possibilities by being harder on my criteria. Here were some of my criteria:\n- Clamshell or wide opening to the main compartment, so it is easy to access your stuff.\n- Hip belt and some degree of hiding hip belt and shoulder straps without looking ugly.\n- Good harness system without it taking too much space when stored in an airplane.\n- Not too heavy.\n- Not a roll-up bag.\n- Possible to use the bag on many occasions, not just backpacking.\n- Not too expensive to get.\n\nI was then choosing between the Osprey Porter, Sojourn 30, Fairview 40, Peak Design 45 (35-45L), and the Thule Landmark 40.\n\n- The Porter was not chosen as I thought 30 liters was going to be too small for longer travels for me\n- Fairview was not chosen as its ability to hide straps is not well, and the design is too ‚Äúbackpacking‚Äù and mainstream for me to use when I take smaller trips in Europe and Denmark.\n- Peak Design 45 is over-designed and makes it heavy and bulky for me, even though I like the features. It is also quite expensive.\n\nTherefore, I ended up with the Landmark as I could use it as a backpack and a ‚Äúduffel bag‚Äù. Here is my review after 3 weeks in Mexico.\n\nFirst of all, the 40-liter size seems correct to me and I can recognize one of the things from a YouTube review I saw: it feels like you can always stuff more into the bag, as the bag is soft. I really like this, as I like to bring souvenirs home. The materials of the bag feel fine so far, so no complaints here.\n\nThe shoulder straps and harness system work fine. It is not like one of the backpacking harness systems you get in the big Osprey bags, but it is fine for wearing under an hour. The hip belt fits my body well (I am 180 cm and weigh 82 kg). Shoulder straps and hip belt can be hidden, but it takes some effort. If the hip belt is hidden, you can feel it up against your body, so I only put it away when flying.\n\nThere are not a lot of organization possibilities in this bag, but some:\n- Laptop compartment: I travel without a laptop, so I don‚Äôt have any major comments on this, but it is there and looks to be working fine.\n- Water bottle pocket: takes some space from the main compartment, but it is there and works well for me.\n- Top hard pocket: a little weird for the bag as you cannot lock it with the zippers, but it still worked out well to store my GoPro and other valuables. I managed to lock it with the main compartment zippers, but if a thief really wants to steal from you, I don‚Äôt believe you can find any bag that can protect you from that.\n- Main compartment:\n  - It has a hidden pocket which is good to hide flat items, works well, and is hard to find.\n  - It has a net/mesh compartment in the opening which works well for small soft items.\n  - The main compartment is just one big space, really good for packing cubes and fits all your stuff. There are two compression straps to hold your items. They work fine, but they feel a bit cheap and vulnerable.\n\nWhen you are packed, you zip the main compartment and then clip the compression straps on. For some people, I can imagine them being annoying, but they did not bother me.\n\nWhat I don‚Äôt like about this bag/what could be improved:\n- A bit easier to hide the hip belt without it being bulky against your body.\n- Another small side pocket inside the main compartment would be nice.\n- Ability to lock the top hard pocket.\n- Water bottle pocket to take less space from the main compartment.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this bag. I really like it. \n\n",

            "body": "Nice one! I considered this one as well as the Peak design and some others. Eventually I went with the Peak design because the features were actually very useful to me and it's got a smaller footprint on my bag. For smaller trips I'm taking the Patagonia Mini MLC or my Osprey daylite 26 + 6. Funnily enough my used PGYtech OneMo Lite 22L is also my go to bag for smaller travels. It's actually more used than the Osprey and Patagonia while only paying ‚Ç¨40 for it haha\n\nI do think 30L is the sweet spot especially when taking a travel bag that you also wanna use as a daypack. The Patagonia and Osprey do a great job of that.\n\nFor the peak design it's slightly too big for daily carry in my opinion. Found a cool bag from Decathlon here in the Netherlands which fits exactly in the front of it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo25pdv8z3pe1.jpeg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ba554a5db005aa936d57948503e2cb2e5aa7c13\n\nI would've loved to try the Evergoods bags or ULA bags but since I'm in the Netherlands they're difficult and very expensive to get... I did buy and take an Aer travel pack 3 from the US last year haha.",

For some people, I can imagine them being annoying, but they did not bother me.\n\nWhat I don‚Äôt like about this bag/what could be improved:\n- A bit easier to hide the hip belt without it being bulky against your body.\n- Another small side pocket inside the main compartment would be nice.\n- Ability to lock the top hard pocket.\n- Water bottle pocket to take less space from the main compartment.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this bag. I really like it. \n\n",

            "body": "Nice one! I considered this one as well as the Peak design and some others. Eventually I went with the Peak design because the features were actually very useful to me and it's got a smaller footprint on my bag. For smaller trips I'm taking the Patagonia Mini MLC or my Osprey daylite 26 + 6. Funnily enough my used PGYtech OneMo Lite 22L is also my go to bag for smaller travels. It's actually more used than the Osprey and Patagonia while only paying ‚Ç¨40 for it haha\n\nI do think 30L is the sweet spot especially when taking a travel bag that you also wanna use as a daypack. The Patagonia and Osprey do a great job of that.\n\nFor the peak design it's slightly too big for daily carry in my opinion. Found a cool bag from Decathlon here in the Netherlands which fits exactly in the front of it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo25pdv8z3pe1.jpeg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ba554a5db005aa936d57948503e2cb2e5aa7c13\n\nI would've loved to try the Evergoods bags or ULA bags but since I'm in the Netherlands they're difficult and very expensive to get... I did buy and take an Aer travel pack 3 from the US last year haha.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/aurzx3/thule_landmark_40l_initial_impressions_and_review/",
        "selftext": "EDIT: Thanks for the questions, everyone. As of today (3/16/19), I'm done with this thread. Hope it was helpful! \n\nHello, fellow one-baggers!  I posted a little over a week ago, asking about this bag.  There are no reviews online yet, but it checked a lot of boxes for me so I went ahead and bought it.  It is available on eBags, who in addition to their recurring sales offer a 25% off coupon for first-time purchases.  I think this extends to the whole order, though I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I are planning a 2-week trip to Europe this summer, and already own a Minaal 2.0 that we've used on various jaunts abroad.  We love it!  Unfortunately, I can't afford $300+ for a second one, so I was looking for something that was similar without breaking the bank.  When all was said and done, I paid around $125 for the Thule.    I'll include the Minaal in a couple pictures for reference and comparisons.\n\n**First my likes** (and be forewarned, there are many!):\n\n* **The security features of the bag.**  The Landmark has a couple minor details that really make this, in my humble opinion, a very secure bag for traveling:\n   * The main compartment has a \"hidden\" zippered pocket at the top, directly underneath the SafeZone (I'll just use the names that Thule has given the bag's features) compartment.  The zipper can easily be hidden, and it is perfect for hiding valuables that you don't need immediate access to - travel documents, passport, extra cash, etc.\n   * Any one of the four compression straps on the outside of the bag can be aligned to pass through the loops attached to the zippers of the main compartment.  These zippers are also lockable.\n   * Finally, the zippers on the SafeZone compartment at the top of the bag have loops that can be threaded through a small plastic piece to deter thieves.  The SafeZone compartment also opens backwards, that is, the hinge is not right next to your back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The SafetyZone zippers affixed by a small plastic bit.  Nice theft deterrent. ](https://i.redd.it/au4dg9vmssi21.jpg)\n\n[Threading exterior compression strap through loops attached to the main zippers, which are also lockable if you buy a lock separately.  ](https://i.redd.it/fqra8hwmssi21.jpg)\n\n[Threaded and clipped.  ](https://i.redd.it/k42wea1nssi21.jpg)\n\n[Kind of hard to see, but this is the internal secret stash pocket.  Top of the interior compartment, just underneath the SafetyZone pocket. ](https://i.redd.it/rrvepqvmssi21.jpg)\n\n* Unlike the clamshell-style Minaal, **the Thule opens like a duffel bag**.\n   * This worried me at first, since duffels with backpack straps typically carry like... Duffels with backpack straps, and not a true backpack.  However, once I loaded it up with approximately a week's worth of clothes and carried it around the house, it felt fine.\n   * Much like a duffel, you can shove your shit in this fairly easily.  I had about four medium packing cubes and my dop kit in the bag and also shoved my Chacos and a jacket in, and felt like I could fit more if necessary.\n   * There are two internal compression straps.  These are useful for locking everything in place, though I will definitely be using my packing cubes in the future.\n   * The four exterior compression straps I mentioned before each attach to the duffel opening.  The female ends of the clips are recessed into the opening panel, offering a clean look.  There are also loops on the sides of the bag you can use to organize the straps.\n* **The straps and hip belt can be stowed**.\n   * I have seen the guys at PackHacker call this the #danglefreelife or something similar, but it was one of the things I was looking for in a bag.  To stow, you simply unclip the shoulder straps, undo the hip belt, and shove into the openings at the top and bottom of the bag.\n   * The straps are pretty well-padded, as is the back of the bag.  I won't know for sure until I get a chance to travel with the bag (next month, likely), but I suspect they will acquit themselves well.  In terms of thickness, the straps feel almost exactly the same as those on the Minaal.\n* **The laptop compartment** is well-padded, and has room for both a tablet and a laptop.\n* **The SafeZone pocket** at the top of the bag has a hard shell, useful for protecting delicate items like your phone, sunglasses, etc.  It also has some webbing for organization, and is fleece-lined.\n* **There are no garish colors**.  I looked at one of the Osprey bags at REI last month, can't recall if it was the Farpoint or a similar model, and the inside of the bag was some neon caca that made me want to throw up.  This bag has a pretty tasteful interior, a light brown with a vague triangular pattern.  I'm a dad, dammit - I don't need no neon.\n* **The water bottle pocket** fit my HydroFlask pretty well, and zips away if you don't need it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My Minaal 2.0 and the Thule side by side.  The Minaal is a bit taller. ](https://i.redd.it/rvmthhr5tsi21.jpg)\n\n[Open and empty.  You can see the internal compression straps.  You'll probably want to use packing cubes with this given the lack of internal organization.  All parts of the interior compartment are easily accessible. ](https://i.redd.it/2aopufs5tsi21.jpg)\n\n[Minaal and Thule side by side opened, so you can appreciate the difference between the two designs.  The sticker on the top of the Thule has not been removed yet.  ](https://i.redd.it/4t885tr5tsi21.jpg)\n\n**On to dislikes!**  I do consider a lot of these minor qualms, and not enough to warrant returning the bag.\n\n* **The laptop compartment zipper is the only zipper on the bag that doesn't have some kind of security device**.  A bit of an oversight, in my opinion.\n* The part of the laptop compartment that I assume is for a tablet has a false bottom; the other section does not.  No biggie; you can probably slip a few pairs of socks or (clean) undies at the bottom to make up for this.  #nopooponthelaptop\n* **The straps are a wee bit problematic**:\n   * Stowing them is a bit of a chore.  You have to really shove them in and I worry that over time, this could cause an issue.  However, the openings have reinforced stitching and after some experimentation I discovered that it works better to stash the hip belt first, followed by the shoulder straps.  In comparison, the Minaal has a fabric panel that zips shut over the straps, is quick and easy to use, and has a much cleaner look.\n   * There is no adjuster near the top of the straps.  This could be an issue with heavier loads.\n   * The clip that attaches the shoulder straps to the bottom is plastic, and doesn't seem to be heavy duty.  If it breaks, your bag is going to be out of commission until you replace it.\n   * I had to adjust the sternum strap (which is removable, but I don't feel like there is any danger of losing it) to the largest option for it to feel comfortable.  For reference, I am a skosh under 5'11\", and have a bit of a barrel chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[All straps stowed. ](https://i.redd.it/sve3bwantsi21.jpg)\n\n[Hip belt stowed, shoulder straps half in and half out. ](https://i.redd.it/b7awmy7ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[One issue - the shoulder strap is secured by one plastic clip.  If it breaks, you are officially F'd in the A.](https://i.redd.it/0be0su8ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[Straps fully deployed!](https://i.redd.it/r5ydwh8ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[Ther sternum strap is adjustable and removable. ](https://i.redd.it/s34520entsi21.jpg)\n\n* **I wish the bottom of the bag were reinforced**.  My daily backpack is some old Timbuk2 thing I inherited from a friend of a friend, and the heavy-duty bottom has saved my stuff on more than one occasion.\n\n**Overall** \\- pretty pleased with the purchase.  This isn't perfect, but is pretty darn close and will work great for me.  I think I got a great bag for not a ton of money, and I look forward to taking it on trips both at home and abroad.  If anyone has any questions, fire away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Here a couple pictures of the bag packed, per request:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bag packed \\(with pillows\\)](https://i.redd.it/o68f2o0n8yi21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Side view of packed bag.  There is definitely some room for more stuff!  Also, this is the water bottle pocket, though it is zipped up. ](https://i.redd.it/kiy9lm5q8yi21.jpg)",

The opinion of many bushcrafters and outdoorsmen is that 500D is plenty tough, and anything more is just added weight with vastly diminishing returns.\n\nFor example, my Vanquest IBEX 35 uses a similar strategy: 500D for all of the bag except for the bottom, which is 1000D.  It's known as a pretty tough bag for hiking and outdoors use.  I wouldn't go thicker for the rest of the bag, cause it's essentially just added weight with little purpose.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't go with more than 500D for most purposes.  The only situation I can think off where you'd want more, is if you plan on doing something with the bag that it wasn't designed for... like dragging it through a pile of sharp rocks, etc.\n\nAlso, you'll like the full zip front panel opening of the Stratoliner much more than a rolltop.  Just my opinion....",

I use it for rock hounding, ie digging up pretty shiny rocks like quartz and beryl, and use it to carry my pick axes, sledgehammer, and whatever pretty rocks I find.  Just the picks and sledge alone weigh a solid 10+lbs, plus water and snacks, my baseweight is close to 20lbs, then add in 10+ lbs of rocks, not to mention it routinely gets slid through caves and dropped in all sorts of environments.  I use it at least twice a week all summer long, for 2 years now, and if I wipe the dirt off it still looks brand new. \n\nThat said, I would chose a pack based on its functions, if you don‚Äôt like a roll top now, then you will probably hate a roll top after using it for a while.  Both TNF and Thule make really solid backpacks, so unless you‚Äôre planning on literally using it to haul rocks, go for the functional features you want, and don‚Äôt worry about the fabric.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/b37zxy/thule_landmark_70_a_review_and_video/",
        "selftext": "I just got back from a quick couple of rainy days in Amsterdam, figured I'd share my feedback on the new Thule Landmark series of bags and how the 70 liter in particular worked out for me last weekend.\n\nThe Landmark bags are available in a:\n\n40 liter (one 40L duffel bag with a built-in laptop compartment)\n\n60 liter (dual bag system = one 40L duffel bag with no laptop compartment that clips into a 20L daypack)\n\n70 liter (dual bag system = one 50L duffel bag with no laptop compartment that clips into a 20L daypack)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[70 Liter Landmark = 20L Daypack + 50L Main Duffel](https://preview.redd.it/lnr9jkipg7n21.png?width=3386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d30f7b16d873a10f1081b9693773aadd3d68f95)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did some video to go along with this writeup:\n\n[https://youtu.be/4X2KASvbZf8](https://youtu.be/4X2KASvbZf8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw these bags last year at the Outdoor Retailer trade show, but at the time I didn't pay too much attention. I was *relatively* happy with my Osprey Ozone 46, Porter 46, Arc'teryx Khard and Blade, and another bag I was using at the time, but kinda wanted them to have a baby and mix some features of each.\n\nBy the time the Consumer Electronics Show rolled around, and I sniffed the Landmarks again at their CES booth. I was impressed enough that figured I should buy one and give it a jaunt to see how it did. I got it from eBags, used a coupon, and got what I felt was a pretty fair deal on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst points: I only travel with a carry on if I can help it, so going with the Landmark 70L was a bit of a risk: It's specs show it as *over* carry on size on most airlines. However, as you'll see in my video, I stuck it in four different airlines bag-limit sizers, and it fit. Admittedly, it was 3/4 full, so I could squish it down. I suppose I could have overstuffed a 60L, or understuffed a 70L with similar results.\n\n[Not a carry on size? We'll see about that!](https://preview.redd.it/7skz8e0zh7n21.png?width=2980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aab6f7c53a79143f1e4e7959c229857770ee33d)\n\nThe 20L daypack also easily fits into the \"personal item\" sizer:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llokz5kcg7n21.png?width=3818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797781d2c9aa3809d33ea58410d5bfd1862b9a40\n\nOn that note, the 70 (which is a 50L main bag + a 20L daypack system) is a little lumpy and sloshy when it's not full. You can tell this is one of those bags where, for sales photos, they're going to have it stuffed to the max with pillows to give it a nice clean shape... but when you get it home, it's floppy and unkempt.\n\nIt's not BAD, but it does have some extra lumpiness if it's not crammed full. I also wish it had some very thin foam like the Porter or Peak Travel bags to give it structure and hold it open when you pack it. I hate how bags collapse when you're packing them. I mean, it's not anywhere near as bad as the Patagonia MLC, which is a soft blob of a bag where all your stuff slides down to the bottom and shifts around as you walk, hurting your back. Conversely, form and rigidity is not as good as a Porter 46 with its foam compression wings, but then again, it's got more useful space than the Porter. The Porter wastes too much space and weight with laptop foam and too much side foam. I don't travel with a laptop often, and when I do, I just sandwich it between some fleece or pants and it's never been a problem.\n\nBecause of this unkemptness/floppiness, I was initially disappointed with it, but after loading it up and carrying it around, I really liked the way it sat on my back - great support, straps and hipbelt worked better than anything else in my quiver. I'm 6'2\" and hip belts either squish my gut (yeah, yeah) or sit way too high just below my ribs. This fit like I suspect hip belts have always supposed to fit me but never did.   :)\n\nHip belts! Arg. Con area: The 40L and the 60L fold up and tuck inside the rear panel. But the 70L... it's got that flap that goes over the whole straps/belts, so someone decided the belt tucking away was redundant. BUT IT'S NOT. There's times I prefer not to wear the hip belt. There's times I carry the bag by the side handle and don't want the hip belt flapping around. So your choices are apparently \"wear the belt\" or \"have it dangle\".\n\nPro area: The top Safe Zone turtle-top hardshell compartment is a nice touch. I'd stick sunglasses and a phone in there, small camera, etc. and not worry about it getting squished. At first, it seemed like not enough organization, but I like just a few pockets that are useful rather than a sea of little gimmick pockets that lose your stuff or it all falls out when the bag is tipped. Thule did this well, with a good compromise of minimal and useful.\n\nSame with the little passport-cash safe pockets on the large and daypack bags. Nice feature, clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, this series is so-close to really good, but is also a bunch of catch-22's for me: I think if I was to do it again, I'd get the 60L, because it's got the tuck-away hip belt and is a little trimmer. Oh - but the Men's 40L and 60L doesn't have the load lifters. But the women's 40L and 60L *do*?  WHY? Arg. Why can't the Landmark series all have load lifters? Why does one's hipbelt tuck away, but not on all of them? Why does the 70L have sewn in straps, whereas the others are buckled in? Maybe these aren't big deals, but they're annoying choices I don't want to make. We're all in this looking for the perfect bag with all the features, not trying to make tradeoffs!  :)\n\nI think I'll keep this bag, it's too nice to get rid of, especially at the price, but I'm interested in comparing it to the much pricier Peak travel bag. I have grown annoyed at the Porter 46 for having too much padding and features I don't use (too much organization and wasted space/weight on laptop compartment), so I am drawn towards the Landmark 60 and 70 not requiring you to have the laptop compartment.\n\n[Those load lifters on the 70L!](https://preview.redd.it/oz6cv3nhg7n21.png?width=3262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee8f028593f04ec939e917606207f1b3eb35c30f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: It's a good bag. Fantastic support, belt and straps. It fits me very well. Happy-medium weight. Looks well constructed and durable. Stylish if it's chock full, lumpy and shifty if not. Hardshell top is a nice feature. Good compromise between organization and lots of open space. Good price for what you're getting.\n\nAsk questions, check the video, I'll answer to best ability!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "body": "I'm getting ready for a couple overseas and domestic trips in the next few months. I've been looking for a suitable bag to meet my needs, which lead me to the selection of either the Eagle Creek Tour 40L or the popular Osprey Farpoint 40L. Both fit within my criteria of quality bags at the same exact price point with lifetime warranties, along with various other desirable traits.\n\nFor this comparison, I will mostly be adding pictures of the Eagle Creek as it is a newer bag with not a lot of information out there. Hopefully it can help people make up their decisions.\n\n**Internal Structure:**\n\nBoth Eagle Creek and Farpoint comes with a book (clam) style opening with easy access to the internals. Whereas the Farpoint 40L opens from top to bottom, and the EC opens up at from right to left. The Farpoint comes with a nice bright green high visibility interior, while the Eagle Creek is just black. Although on the EC it varies depending on the color you choose.\n\n[Comparison side by side](https://imgur.com/hYmY1NQ)\n\nIn terms of internal organization, both are very similar in terms of sizing. Both also come with internal clips. Here is a image where I quickly stuff the bag with a fully loaded EC Medium and Small packing cube, Marmot Precip, and 7 pairs of socks. Also in the internal pocket is an REI Co-op Flash 18L with my bladder, and 1 quart bag with toiletries.\n\n[Farpoint - Interior Loaded Up](https://imgur.com/3Gglzpm)\n\n[EC - Interior Loaded Up](https://imgur.com/SRbxE5P)\n\n**Size and Measurements:**\n\nBoth are rated at 40L, and I would say the measurement dimensions provided by both Farpoint and EC on their websites are correct. Although, in terms of capacity it seems the Farpoint can definitely hold more due to the outside pockets.\n\n[Picture of both bags side by side fully stuffed with clothes and towels](https://imgur.com/h4bb0VS)\n\nThe EC comes with a single side water bottle pouch, while the Farpoint comes with two back water bottle pouches. The EC bottle pouch seems to hold more. Here is an [image of the Farpoint](https://imgur.com/SiCa8lj) and [EC](https://imgur.com/wtWvdzQ) using my 18 oz Hydroflask. Not a fan of the Farpoint water bottle holders on the back, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nThe EC has the capability to expand to 43L according to the outside tag. I feel once you unzip the bag to provide the expanded capacity their sizes are more evenly matched.\n\n**Shoulder straps, hip belt, and sternum strap:**\n\nBoth come with a foam shoulder straps. The Farpoint shoulder straps are a bit wider, but the edgeless design on the EC make carrying the bag much more comfortable, at least for me. Also the EC has a more pronounced S curve as compared to the Farpoint which adds to the overall comfortable.\n\nBoth bags come with a sternum strap with a built in whistle. Although the EC is a stretchy material versus the Farpoint non-stretchy.\n\n[Side by side view](https://imgur.com/RREsfSN)\n\nThe Farpoint's hip belt is much better and provides more surface and cushion to wrap around your body. The straps are also wider than the 1 inch straps of the EC. The EC hip strap is pretty thin in comparison, but is also stowable which the Farpoint is not.\n\n[Image side by side](https://imgur.com/W8Nu6YB)\n\n[Hipbelt side by side](https://imgur.com/IP4zISJ)\n\nI also like to mention both bags have the ability to stow away the straps. The Farpoint has a wrap which can cover the shoulder and hip straps. The EC also has a type of strap and waist belt [cover](https://imgur.com/NVhO47V), but it also doubles as a [rain cover](https://imgur.com/lyNHOiR)! The EC also has an adjustable yoke that is secured to the back padded area using velcro.\n\n**External Features:**\n\nBoth the EC and Farpoint come with a top handle and side handle. [The Farpoint](https://imgur.com/SD0gIIX) handles are larger and have more cushion, but the [EC](https://imgur.com/mL4QUm1) is adequate in terms of sizing.\n\n[Side Handles](https://imgur.com/mhlGFf7)\n\nFarpoint has a one large external pocket with a laptop organizer which sits in the back, so it sits to the outside of the bag. Apparently a lot of people hate this feature, but I don't plan on carrying a laptop.\n\nEC has two minimalist pockets on the [outside](https://imgur.com/s0ZR9T0) with no organization. The bottom pocket does have a key leash. EC bag is the traditional laptop organization near the back of the bag with a side opening zipper. \n\nSpeaking of the [zippers](https://imgur.com/5dr1CF3), the Farpoint uses a larger YKK zipper and EC uses their own brand of zippers. I don't know why, but I expected the Farpoint zippers to be much smoother. It was quite the opposite, I found the EC to be smoother and easier to open. Opening the Farpoint was a bit of a pain, as the rain cover would often add resistance to the pulling of the zippers.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nYMMV! Everyone's body is ***DIFFERENT***. I got the M/L torso size for both bags as their respective sizing seem to match my body type. For this I thought the Farpoint would have been the clear winner here, but surprisingly I found the Eagle Creek to be much more comfortable even with the puny waist strap. Both bags seem to sit on my hip shelf well, but the [back lower padding](https://imgur.com/vJOMX5N) of the EC adds a lot of comfortable to my lower back. I feel the Farpoint adds more strain on my lower back over longer periods of time. I tested this by wearing the bag for about an hour or so.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAnyway, I hope this helps anyone out consider either of these two bags.  I'm about to put in my Amazon return, as I've tested these bags for a month now. In you are wondering, I am picking the Eagle Creek Tour 40L. But that is just my preference in terms of comfortable, organization, and aesthetic. Both bags are not perfect, but I feel more comfortable with the Eagle Creek. If I could just combine the high visibility interior and waist belt of the Farpoint with the Eagle Creek, it would have been near perfect.",
