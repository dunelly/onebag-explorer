It’s finally been surpassed by the 2024 Rush, which is an Arcteryx return to form.\n\nFirstly the fit is sublime, with wonderful articulation and mobility in my usual size large. The helmet is huge and swallows a ski helmet like a cobra. When the hood is down the collar gives plenty of room for hooded mid layers, ski helmet ear pads and a chin strap. Even with a neck gaiter, there was n tightness around the trachea. This is an improvement over the Rush LT which featured a smaller collar overall. \n\nHand pockets are set high, and there’s an exterior chest pocket for easy access to whatever. There’s also a pass pocket on the arm. On the inside there’s two drop pockets, with another zip pocket for securing small items on the inside of the jacket. The number of pockets is more than what the Rush LT. Though I wish there was some form of organization in the pockets to secure things so they don’t fall out when you open your pockets with half frozen hands. \n\nThere is no powder skirt which is great. Since Arcteryx likes to play product placement games and not offer zip out powder skirts, having a proper ski shell with no skirt is a blessing. \n\nOverall aesthetic is svelte. The color is hi-viz with contrasting blocking and dark indigo/black zippers which look real sharp. Don’t worry about not being seen, this yellow is more like a guide jacket and can be spotted from space. The patternng, stitching and design lines all look great and will put a smile on your face as soon as you unbox it. \n\nThe hem adjust toggle is an upgrade over my Rush IS due to a larger button and surface area for when gloves are worn. However the Rush LT used Cohaesive which pulled up into the jacket. Bummer, but only slightly. \n\nLastly this jacket is much tougher than the Rush LT, with Most Rugged and 80 Denier throughout. An overall improvement over classic Gore Pro and zonal 80/40 denier textiles used in the Rush LT.\n\nSo I’m officially calling it: The Rush LT finally has a proper replacement. For those enamored with the absent Beta SV, the 2024 Rush can play a solid alternative…provided you like backcountry friendly hi-viz colors…\n\nMore soon after I ski in it in a couple of weeks.",

It’s finally been surpassed by the 2024 Rush, which is an Arcteryx return to form.\n\nFirstly the fit is sublime, with wonderful articulation and mobility in my usual size large. The helmet is huge and swallows a ski helmet like a cobra. When the hood is down the collar gives plenty of room for hooded mid layers, ski helmet ear pads and a chin strap. Even with a neck gaiter, there was n tightness around the trachea. This is an improvement over the Rush LT which featured a smaller collar overall. \n\nHand pockets are set high, and there’s an exterior chest pocket for easy access to whatever. There’s also a pass pocket on the arm. On the inside there’s two drop pockets, with another zip pocket for securing small items on the inside of the jacket. The number of pockets is more than what the Rush LT. Though I wish there was some form of organization in the pockets to secure things so they don’t fall out when you open your pockets with half frozen hands. \n\nThere is no powder skirt which is great. Since Arcteryx likes to play product placement games and not offer zip out powder skirts, having a proper ski shell with no skirt is a blessing. \n\nOverall aesthetic is svelte. The color is hi-viz with contrasting blocking and dark indigo/black zippers which look real sharp. Don’t worry about not being seen, this yellow is more like a guide jacket and can be spotted from space. The patternng, stitching and design lines all look great and will put a smile on your face as soon as you unbox it. \n\nThe hem adjust toggle is an upgrade over my Rush IS due to a larger button and surface area for when gloves are worn. However the Rush LT used Cohaesive which pulled up into the jacket. Bummer, but only slightly. \n\nLastly this jacket is much tougher than the Rush LT, with Most Rugged and 80 Denier throughout. An overall improvement over classic Gore Pro and zonal 80/40 denier textiles used in the Rush LT.\n\nSo I’m officially calling it: The Rush LT finally has a proper replacement. For those enamored with the absent Beta SV, the 2024 Rush can play a solid alternative…provided you like backcountry friendly hi-viz colors…\n\nMore soon after I ski in it in a couple of weeks.",

There’s also a pass pocket on the arm. On the inside there’s two drop pockets, with another zip pocket for securing small items on the inside of the jacket. The number of pockets is more than what the Rush LT. Though I wish there was some form of organization in the pockets to secure things so they don’t fall out when you open your pockets with half frozen hands. \n\nThere is no powder skirt which is great. Since Arcteryx likes to play product placement games and not offer zip out powder skirts, having a proper ski shell with no skirt is a blessing. \n\nOverall aesthetic is svelte. The color is hi-viz with contrasting blocking and dark indigo/black zippers which look real sharp. Don’t worry about not being seen, this yellow is more like a guide jacket and can be spotted from space. The patternng, stitching and design lines all look great and will put a smile on your face as soon as you unbox it. \n\nThe hem adjust toggle is an upgrade over my Rush IS due to a larger button and surface area for when gloves are worn. However the Rush LT used Cohaesive which pulled up into the jacket. Bummer, but only slightly. \n\nLastly this jacket is much tougher than the Rush LT, with Most Rugged and 80 Denier throughout. An overall improvement over classic Gore Pro and zonal 80/40 denier textiles used in the Rush LT.\n\nSo I’m officially calling it: The Rush LT finally has a proper replacement. For those enamored with the absent Beta SV, the 2024 Rush can play a solid alternative…provided you like backcountry friendly hi-viz colors…\n\nMore soon after I ski in it in a couple of weeks.",

I would also like them to be a little bit more on the loose/baggy side. I can’t seem to find it anywhere! The only models I found so far that seems to meet my requirements are the burton goretex C-knit kalausi bib pants - But they are only available in an ugly yellow color (and also not available in my country in L or XL atm) And the burton daybeacon 3l bib, which is also out of stock in my sizes… I’ve tried the volcom Arthur gore tex pants, but they wear out super fast and are also insulated. I like the fit on them though.\n\nIt is also super hard to find any information on how insulated each pant is because every manufacturer seems to have different ways of specifying the warmth of the pant. I have bought 2 pairs of burton pants that were stated to be a “1” in warmth on a scale from 1-10, but they were still insulated and super warm on the way up. All I want is a pure shell pant (like a shell jacket) with no insulation and a nice relaxed/baggy fit, can anyone point me in the right direction?😁\n\nPutting in a bad screengrab of the Arthur longo pants on me. I am a somewhat tall/skinny guy with big feet, so most pants with pre bent knees makes me look like I wear bootcut jeans. I know, looks aren’t the most important thing in the backcountry but i might as well try to find something i think looks nice while looking for new pants🤷‍♂️",

            "body": "Nunatak here!\n\nLate last winter we adapted the [Skaha down pullover](https://nunatakusa.com/skaha-ultralight/151-skaha-apex-ultralight-climashield-jacket.html) to Apex synthetic insulation. Using the 2.5 oz/yd (85g/m) Apex it ends up at 9.8 oz in size large with hood. The front tunnel ‘muff’ pocket brings it up to 10.6. It is sized for layering and will fit on top of bulky shells.\n\nWanting to bring down the weight even further with a new design we primarily worked on two aspects: sourcing a slightly lighter, more compact APEX insulation, and reworking the patterns to make the jacket fit trimmer. \n\nThe result is a new rendition of an 75g/m - 2.2oz Apex top, called the JMT Jacket. It will have a full hood but no exterior pockets. To cut the weight every detail was evaluated. The shock cord hem and hood casing is fixed, eliminating the cord locks. There’s no hang loop, care tag or big Nunatak label.\n\nWe also set up a hot knife cutting table, eliminating an additional 10g by not having to serge the edges.\n\nThe full zip adds only 3 grams, but makes a trim cut jacket much easier to put on and off. The sleeves are narrowed, the front is shortened and the waist is cut in. The chest is also a little tighter, but not excessively. The back is still long with good coverage.\n\nThe size large in the picture is 7.8 ounces (220g), I think about the same as the down filled Ghost Whisperer from Mountain Hardwear, a jacket long considered one of the lightest in the field. I would guess the Nunatak one is warmer, and it's made with slightly ‘burlier’ 10d fabrics. However, I don’t have a GW to compare directly with.\n\nFor folks not needing the hood, there’s a 20-25g weight saving with a regular collar option. This will bring a large close to, or maybe under 7oz.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1ba9t90/salomon_x_ultra_4_goretex_shoes_quality_has_gone/",
        "selftext": "I’ve been a Salomon fan for 20 years. It’s the only hiking shoe I’ve worn and always been happy with it, specifically the X Ultra model w/ GoreTex.\n\nWhen the new X Ultra 4 model came out a few years ago, I purchased a pair and was immediately put off by the 1) much shorter tongue which made it extremely hard to tuck the laces strap into and 2) the pain in my toe box that I was getting with every step due to the crease spot of the shoe when I took steps forward. I had too much pain in my foot so I found a pair of X Ultra 3 on Amazon and used that instead. But now I need new shoes…\n\nSo, fast forward to when I purchased a new pair of these newly updated Salomon X Ultra 4 WIDE at a size 10 for men and after trying them on, my left shoe was painful, AGAIN, due to the crease issue whereas my right foot was perfectly fine. I could clearly see that there was a major difference between the left and right shoe crease points and while the right shoe felt great, I noticed the sewing quality of the left shoe was different and I could see that it stretched the Gore-Tex material more in the toe box area which caused the painful crease in a spot where it shouldn’t be creasing. The right shoe was creasing fine with no issue.\n\nSo, I decided to buy another exact same pair, hoping that the new pair’s left shoe would be sewn properly and be a good fit without the painful creasing issue. I just tried the new pair and both left and right shoes fit great with no toe box crease pain. FINALLY.\n\nI chalk this up to Salomon cutting corners to save on costs and going with cheaper shoe makers which has resulted in quality going downhill, as I’ve experienced. I was about ready to jump ship because of this. About to test the new pair on a hike tomorrow. So far with a quick test at home, the crease issue is a non issue with this pair. But I’ve also heard from others that the tread wears way quicker now with these new shoes. If that’s the case, I absolutely will be jumping ship and exploring other options.\n\nHere’s a photo of two pairs of the shoes, showing the left foot shoe. The one on the left has the crease where it destroys my toes where as the new pair in the right are properly sewn which results in a usable shoe.",
