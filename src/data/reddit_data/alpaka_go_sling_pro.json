        "selftext": "\nI just received my Alpaka Flow 4L, and used it for the first time today. It’s not perfect, but I already love the bag, and can see myself using it often. \n\nI didn’t intend on this being a review, but will say that it’s a great EDC size for me on weekends, and casual uses when I leave the house, and a smaller sling simply won’t do.  \n\nIn other threads, some people complained about the size being too small, but to me, the 4L listed on the spec-sheet feels accurate when comparing to my other bags of similar size:  Aer Daily Sling 2 (previous 4.5L version), and a Trakke Kelso (5.5L). If anything, it feels larger than my Daily 2.0, though it may be due to the sling having 2 separate compartments, while the Flow has one.  In practice, the space offered by my Flow is certainly more useful and flexible. \n\nCompared to my Kelso, which offers a more squared-off internal space, it feels slightly smaller. However, the Flow is shorter, so the space can be more useful. Also, it has a padded bottom so that it stands up on its own.  The side offer slightly more padding because of the pockets on the front and back, so I feel better about keeping an iPad, iPad Mini, or Kindle. I can even a camera (Ricoh GR-III or my new Fuji X-M5) in there, unprotected.  My X-M5 will fit in the internal pockets when only a pancake lens is attached!!  \n\nThe Flow fits an 11” iPad Air (2024) with a Smart Keyboard Folio, and can be fully zipped up. However, I’m not sure whether it would fit with the Magic Keyboard Folio, or the Logitech keyboard case, because we don’t own them. Not zipped up, anyway. You could insert your iPad and not fully zip up the bag, leaving a corner of your iPad exposed. \n\nMy ONLY complaint is that the strap is slightly narrow. It’s fine if you’re not carry much weight, but I’d imagine it not being comfy when packed with heavier items. \n\nAnyway, this post was meant to focus on the water bottle holder. I have taken some photos of the Flow with various water bottle sizes to give you an idea what it can reasonably carry. \n\nBelow is a list of the bottle sizes I used.  All cups and bottles are double-wall insulated, stainless steel. Non-insulated bottles are probably smaller. \n\n1. An 8oz takeaway coffee cup (roughly 230ml). Note:  My 12oz version of the same cup also fits well, but isn’t shown here. \n\n2. A 12oz water bottle. \n\n3. Another 350ml (roughly 12oz) bottle. This one is more of an Asian-style water bottle (Tiger or Zojirushi types), which is slightly narrower.  Better lids, too!!  \n\n4. An 18oz (530ml) Hydroflask bottle.\n\n5. A 32oz (approx 1L) bottle. \n\n\nNote:  I also tried a 600ml bottle that fit very well, and a slightly narrower, but taller 1L bottle (purple) that also fits. \n\n\nObservations:  They all “fit” within the holder, but with the 1L bottle inserted, you cannot zip up the water bottle holder, or use the stretchy cord to secure the bottle in place.   Fortunately, the two bottles I tried fit very snugly, and felt securely held in place. \n\nThe bigger issue was around weight.  I would NOT want to use this bag to hold a 1L bottle filled with water, as it becomes a bit front heavy. The bottle may not fall out, but you’d have to be careful when taking the bag on and off with the bottle in place, or any time the bag is tipped at an angle while wearing it.  Instead, you should take the bottle out of the holder before taking off the bag.  That, or be very mindful of the bottle. \n\nPersonally, I’d stick to 500ml (18oz) or 600ml bottles. They fit perfectly, and the bag is suited to its weight when filled with water. \n\nMy 8oz coffee cup was too short and got lost in there, but I’d happily still use it. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1k83k24/alpaka_flow_4l_mini_review/",
        "selftext": "\nI just received my Alpaka Flow 4L, and used it for the first time today. It’s not perfect, but I already love the bag, and can see myself using it often. \n\nI didn’t intend on this being a review, but will say that it’s a great EDC size for me on weekends, and casual uses when I leave the house, and a smaller sling simply won’t do.  \n\nIn other threads, some people complained about the size being too small, but to me, the 4L listed on the spec-sheet feels accurate when comparing to my other bags of similar size:  Aer Daily Sling 2 (previous 4.5L version), and a Trakke Kelso (5.5L). If anything, it feels larger than my Daily 2.0, though it may be due to the sling having 2 separate compartments, while the Flow has one.  In practice, the space offered by my Flow is certainly more useful and flexible. \n\nCompared to my Kelso, which offers a more squared-off internal space, it feels slightly smaller. However, the Flow is shorter, so the space can be more useful. Also, it has a padded bottom so that it stands up on its own.  The side offer slightly more padding because of the pockets on the front and back, so I feel better about keeping an iPad, iPad Mini, or Kindle. I can even a camera (Ricoh GR-III or my new Fuji X-M5) in there, unprotected.  My X-M5 will fit in the internal pockets when only a pancake lens is attached!!  \n\nThe Flow fits an 11” iPad Air (2024) with a Smart Keyboard Folio, and can be fully zipped up. However, I’m not sure whether it would fit with the Magic Keyboard Folio, or the Logitech keyboard case, because we don’t own them. Not zipped up, anyway. You could insert your iPad and not fully zip up the bag, leaving a corner of your iPad exposed. \n\nMy ONLY complaint is that the strap is slightly narrow. It’s fine if you’re not carry much weight, but I’d imagine it not being comfy when packed with heavier items. \n\nAnyway, this post was meant to focus on the water bottle holder. I have taken some photos of the Flow with various water bottle sizes to give you an idea what it can reasonably carry. \n\nBelow is a list of the bottle sizes I used.  All cups and bottles are double-wall insulated, stainless steel. Non-insulated bottles are probably smaller. \n\n1. An 8oz takeaway coffee cup (roughly 230ml). Note:  My 12oz version of the same cup also fits well, but isn’t shown here. \n\n2. A 12oz water bottle. \n\n3. Another 350ml (roughly 12oz) bottle. This one is more of an Asian-style water bottle (Tiger or Zojirushi types), which is slightly narrower.  Better lids, too!!  \n\n4. An 18oz (530ml) Hydroflask bottle.\n\n5. A 32oz (approx 1L) bottle. \n\n\nNote:  I also tried a 600ml bottle that fit very well, and a slightly narrower, but taller 1L bottle (purple) that also fits. \n\n\nObservations:  They all “fit” within the holder, but with the 1L bottle inserted, you cannot zip up the water bottle holder, or use the stretchy cord to secure the bottle in place.   Fortunately, the two bottles I tried fit very snugly, and felt securely held in place. \n\nThe bigger issue was around weight.  I would NOT want to use this bag to hold a 1L bottle filled with water, as it becomes a bit front heavy. The bottle may not fall out, but you’d have to be careful when taking the bag on and off with the bottle in place, or any time the bag is tipped at an angle while wearing it.  Instead, you should take the bottle out of the holder before taking off the bag.  That, or be very mindful of the bottle. \n\nPersonally, I’d stick to 500ml (18oz) or 600ml bottles. They fit perfectly, and the bag is suited to its weight when filled with water. \n\nMy 8oz coffee cup was too short and got lost in there, but I’d happily still use it. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1k83k24/alpaka_flow_4l_mini_review/",
        "selftext": "\nI just received my Alpaka Flow 4L, and used it for the first time today. It’s not perfect, but I already love the bag, and can see myself using it often. \n\nI didn’t intend on this being a review, but will say that it’s a great EDC size for me on weekends, and casual uses when I leave the house, and a smaller sling simply won’t do.  \n\nIn other threads, some people complained about the size being too small, but to me, the 4L listed on the spec-sheet feels accurate when comparing to my other bags of similar size:  Aer Daily Sling 2 (previous 4.5L version), and a Trakke Kelso (5.5L). If anything, it feels larger than my Daily 2.0, though it may be due to the sling having 2 separate compartments, while the Flow has one.  In practice, the space offered by my Flow is certainly more useful and flexible. \n\nCompared to my Kelso, which offers a more squared-off internal space, it feels slightly smaller. However, the Flow is shorter, so the space can be more useful. Also, it has a padded bottom so that it stands up on its own.  The side offer slightly more padding because of the pockets on the front and back, so I feel better about keeping an iPad, iPad Mini, or Kindle. I can even a camera (Ricoh GR-III or my new Fuji X-M5) in there, unprotected.  My X-M5 will fit in the internal pockets when only a pancake lens is attached!!  \n\nThe Flow fits an 11” iPad Air (2024) with a Smart Keyboard Folio, and can be fully zipped up. However, I’m not sure whether it would fit with the Magic Keyboard Folio, or the Logitech keyboard case, because we don’t own them. Not zipped up, anyway. You could insert your iPad and not fully zip up the bag, leaving a corner of your iPad exposed. \n\nMy ONLY complaint is that the strap is slightly narrow. It’s fine if you’re not carry much weight, but I’d imagine it not being comfy when packed with heavier items. \n\nAnyway, this post was meant to focus on the water bottle holder. I have taken some photos of the Flow with various water bottle sizes to give you an idea what it can reasonably carry. \n\nBelow is a list of the bottle sizes I used.  All cups and bottles are double-wall insulated, stainless steel. Non-insulated bottles are probably smaller. \n\n1. An 8oz takeaway coffee cup (roughly 230ml). Note:  My 12oz version of the same cup also fits well, but isn’t shown here. \n\n2. A 12oz water bottle. \n\n3. Another 350ml (roughly 12oz) bottle. This one is more of an Asian-style water bottle (Tiger or Zojirushi types), which is slightly narrower.  Better lids, too!!  \n\n4. An 18oz (530ml) Hydroflask bottle.\n\n5. A 32oz (approx 1L) bottle. \n\n\nNote:  I also tried a 600ml bottle that fit very well, and a slightly narrower, but taller 1L bottle (purple) that also fits. \n\n\nObservations:  They all “fit” within the holder, but with the 1L bottle inserted, you cannot zip up the water bottle holder, or use the stretchy cord to secure the bottle in place.   Fortunately, the two bottles I tried fit very snugly, and felt securely held in place. \n\nThe bigger issue was around weight.  I would NOT want to use this bag to hold a 1L bottle filled with water, as it becomes a bit front heavy. The bottle may not fall out, but you’d have to be careful when taking the bag on and off with the bottle in place, or any time the bag is tipped at an angle while wearing it.  Instead, you should take the bottle out of the holder before taking off the bag.  That, or be very mindful of the bottle. \n\nPersonally, I’d stick to 500ml (18oz) or 600ml bottles. They fit perfectly, and the bag is suited to its weight when filled with water. \n\nMy 8oz coffee cup was too short and got lost in there, but I’d happily still use it. ",

It’s not perfect, but I already love the bag, and can see myself using it often. \n\nI didn’t intend on this being a review, but will say that it’s a great EDC size for me on weekends, and casual uses when I leave the house, and a smaller sling simply won’t do.  \n\nIn other threads, some people complained about the size being too small, but to me, the 4L listed on the spec-sheet feels accurate when comparing to my other bags of similar size:  Aer Daily Sling 2 (previous 4.5L version), and a Trakke Kelso (5.5L). If anything, it feels larger than my Daily 2.0, though it may be due to the sling having 2 separate compartments, while the Flow has one.  In practice, the space offered by my Flow is certainly more useful and flexible. \n\nCompared to my Kelso, which offers a more squared-off internal space, it feels slightly smaller. However, the Flow is shorter, so the space can be more useful. Also, it has a padded bottom so that it stands up on its own.  The side offer slightly more padding because of the pockets on the front and back, so I feel better about keeping an iPad, iPad Mini, or Kindle. I can even a camera (Ricoh GR-III or my new Fuji X-M5) in there, unprotected.  My X-M5 will fit in the internal pockets when only a pancake lens is attached!!  \n\nThe Flow fits an 11” iPad Air (2024) with a Smart Keyboard Folio, and can be fully zipped up. However, I’m not sure whether it would fit with the Magic Keyboard Folio, or the Logitech keyboard case, because we don’t own them. Not zipped up, anyway. You could insert your iPad and not fully zip up the bag, leaving a corner of your iPad exposed. \n\nMy ONLY complaint is that the strap is slightly narrow. It’s fine if you’re not carry much weight, but I’d imagine it not being comfy when packed with heavier items. \n\nAnyway, this post was meant to focus on the water bottle holder. I have taken some photos of the Flow with various water bottle sizes to give you an idea what it can reasonably carry. \n\nBelow is a list of the bottle sizes I used.  All cups and bottles are double-wall insulated, stainless steel. Non-insulated bottles are probably smaller. \n\n1. An 8oz takeaway coffee cup (roughly 230ml). Note:  My 12oz version of the same cup also fits well, but isn’t shown here. \n\n2. A 12oz water bottle. \n\n3. Another 350ml (roughly 12oz) bottle. This one is more of an Asian-style water bottle (Tiger or Zojirushi types), which is slightly narrower.  Better lids, too!!  \n\n4. An 18oz (530ml) Hydroflask bottle.\n\n5. A 32oz (approx 1L) bottle. \n\n\nNote:  I also tried a 600ml bottle that fit very well, and a slightly narrower, but taller 1L bottle (purple) that also fits. \n\n\nObservations:  They all “fit” within the holder, but with the 1L bottle inserted, you cannot zip up the water bottle holder, or use the stretchy cord to secure the bottle in place.   Fortunately, the two bottles I tried fit very snugly, and felt securely held in place. \n\nThe bigger issue was around weight.  I would NOT want to use this bag to hold a 1L bottle filled with water, as it becomes a bit front heavy. The bottle may not fall out, but you’d have to be careful when taking the bag on and off with the bottle in place, or any time the bag is tipped at an angle while wearing it.  Instead, you should take the bottle out of the holder before taking off the bag.  That, or be very mindful of the bottle. \n\nPersonally, I’d stick to 500ml (18oz) or 600ml bottles. They fit perfectly, and the bag is suited to its weight when filled with water. \n\nMy 8oz coffee cup was too short and got lost in there, but I’d happily still use it. ",

        "selftext": "I recently bought both the Alpaka Go Sling Mini V2 and the Aer Day sling bag to see for myself which one I would like most as my edc sling. It is my first good quality bag I’ve purchased. Before this I had a basic Nike sling bag. I was in search for a new sling bag that had more space and could fit my edc items comfortably without having to leave anything behind.\n\nThoughts on the Alpaka Go Sling Mini V2: I like the sleek minimal design of the bag. The inside of the bag seems smaller than 5L in my opinion. It rained the day I got it so I go to test out the material of the non x-pac version and it was great. The water slid off the bag as if it was slick. I personally liked the buckle of the strap because of the sound it makes. The strap would slide around a bit on my shoulder but it never slipped off as I would then readjust it before it did. When I would set the bag down I noticed the strap would loosen up a bit so some times when I’d put it back on I’d have to readjust the strap again. Overall I think the bag looks great and is made of great quality as well. I don’t plan on keeping it only because the interior did feel cramped. \n\nThoughts on the Aer Day Sling: I’ve only had it for about 2 days and I love it. It’s lightweight and the interior feels more spacious than the Alpaka. I like the organization pockets it offers. I haven’t had issues with the fidlock buckle like I’ve seen others have. I would’ve preferred for the buckle to be in the middle like the Alpaka but it’s not a dealbreaker. The strap doesn’t slide around my shoulder like the Alpaka. It’s easier to access items inside the bag because the zippers go halfway down the bag whereas the Alpaka it doesn’t go halfway down. I still have space left even with all of my edc items which is what I was looking for.\n\nOverall I think both bags are great. I will be keeping the Aer Day Sling bag since it meets my needs.",

            "body": "I recently got the Go Mini V2 and was using a City Sling 2 previously. I also have an older Day Sling but I think they changed the design a lot.\n\nI wanted a bag that can do everyday phone/wallet duty but also carry my a6700 compact camera with a big lens occasionally. I was just barely able to get the camera into the City Sling 2 but there wasn't room to also hold the phone or anything else comfortably. The Go Mini solves that as I can still use the thin front and rear pockets with the camera in the bag. The pockets and organization are good for the way I use it for travel, with loose small bills in one section and more valuable things in a separate pocket.\n\nMy only complaint with the Go Mini so far is the strap. The Fidlock buckle is large and doesn't sit flat. It's hard to get it adjusted to a comfortable position where it's not pressed under backpack straps. It also has the loosening problem where the strap backs out when the bag is off. \n\nThe strap ends are loose so they can bunch up since the retention loops don't really hold them in place when flat - rolling the excess strap material under the elastic might work though. The Aer strap adjustment system that doesn't leave a loose end is much nicer. I also find the magnetic buckle much easier to operate but don't have much practice on the new Fidlock yet.",

        "selftext": "I recently bought both the Alpaka Go Sling Mini V2 and the Aer Day sling bag to see for myself which one I would like most as my edc sling. It is my first good quality bag I’ve purchased. Before this I had a basic Nike sling bag. I was in search for a new sling bag that had more space and could fit my edc items comfortably without having to leave anything behind.\n\nThoughts on the Alpaka Go Sling Mini V2: I like the sleek minimal design of the bag. The inside of the bag seems smaller than 5L in my opinion. It rained the day I got it so I go to test out the material of the non x-pac version and it was great. The water slid off the bag as if it was slick. I personally liked the buckle of the strap because of the sound it makes. The strap would slide around a bit on my shoulder but it never slipped off as I would then readjust it before it did. When I would set the bag down I noticed the strap would loosen up a bit so some times when I’d put it back on I’d have to readjust the strap again. Overall I think the bag looks great and is made of great quality as well. I don’t plan on keeping it only because the interior did feel cramped. \n\nThoughts on the Aer Day Sling: I’ve only had it for about 2 days and I love it. It’s lightweight and the interior feels more spacious than the Alpaka. I like the organization pockets it offers. I haven’t had issues with the fidlock buckle like I’ve seen others have. I would’ve preferred for the buckle to be in the middle like the Alpaka but it’s not a dealbreaker. The strap doesn’t slide around my shoulder like the Alpaka. It’s easier to access items inside the bag because the zippers go halfway down the bag whereas the Alpaka it doesn’t go halfway down. I still have space left even with all of my edc items which is what I was looking for.\n\nOverall I think both bags are great. I will be keeping the Aer Day Sling bag since it meets my needs.",

I also have an older Day Sling but I think they changed the design a lot.\n\nI wanted a bag that can do everyday phone/wallet duty but also carry my a6700 compact camera with a big lens occasionally. I was just barely able to get the camera into the City Sling 2 but there wasn't room to also hold the phone or anything else comfortably. The Go Mini solves that as I can still use the thin front and rear pockets with the camera in the bag. The pockets and organization are good for the way I use it for travel, with loose small bills in one section and more valuable things in a separate pocket.\n\nMy only complaint with the Go Mini so far is the strap. The Fidlock buckle is large and doesn't sit flat. It's hard to get it adjusted to a comfortable position where it's not pressed under backpack straps. It also has the loosening problem where the strap backs out when the bag is off. \n\nThe strap ends are loose so they can bunch up since the retention loops don't really hold them in place when flat - rolling the excess strap material under the elastic might work though. The Aer strap adjustment system that doesn't leave a loose end is much nicer. I also find the magnetic buckle much easier to operate but don't have much practice on the new Fidlock yet.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1fejnak/aer_day_sling_and_alpaka_go_sling_mini_v2/",
        "selftext": "I recently bought both the Alpaka Go Sling Mini V2 and the Aer Day sling bag to see for myself which one I would like most as my edc sling. It is my first good quality bag I’ve purchased. Before this I had a basic Nike sling bag. I was in search for a new sling bag that had more space and could fit my edc items comfortably without having to leave anything behind.\n\nThoughts on the Alpaka Go Sling Mini V2: I like the sleek minimal design of the bag. The inside of the bag seems smaller than 5L in my opinion. It rained the day I got it so I go to test out the material of the non x-pac version and it was great. The water slid off the bag as if it was slick. I personally liked the buckle of the strap because of the sound it makes. The strap would slide around a bit on my shoulder but it never slipped off as I would then readjust it before it did. When I would set the bag down I noticed the strap would loosen up a bit so some times when I’d put it back on I’d have to readjust the strap again. Overall I think the bag looks great and is made of great quality as well. I don’t plan on keeping it only because the interior did feel cramped. \n\nThoughts on the Aer Day Sling: I’ve only had it for about 2 days and I love it. It’s lightweight and the interior feels more spacious than the Alpaka. I like the organization pockets it offers. I haven’t had issues with the fidlock buckle like I’ve seen others have. I would’ve preferred for the buckle to be in the middle like the Alpaka but it’s not a dealbreaker. The strap doesn’t slide around my shoulder like the Alpaka. It’s easier to access items inside the bag because the zippers go halfway down the bag whereas the Alpaka it doesn’t go halfway down. I still have space left even with all of my edc items which is what I was looking for.\n\nOverall I think both bags are great. I will be keeping the Aer Day Sling bag since it meets my needs.",

            "body": "I recently got the Go Mini V2 and was using a City Sling 2 previously. I also have an older Day Sling but I think they changed the design a lot.\n\nI wanted a bag that can do everyday phone/wallet duty but also carry my a6700 compact camera with a big lens occasionally. I was just barely able to get the camera into the City Sling 2 but there wasn't room to also hold the phone or anything else comfortably. The Go Mini solves that as I can still use the thin front and rear pockets with the camera in the bag. The pockets and organization are good for the way I use it for travel, with loose small bills in one section and more valuable things in a separate pocket.\n\nMy only complaint with the Go Mini so far is the strap. The Fidlock buckle is large and doesn't sit flat. It's hard to get it adjusted to a comfortable position where it's not pressed under backpack straps. It also has the loosening problem where the strap backs out when the bag is off. \n\nThe strap ends are loose so they can bunch up since the retention loops don't really hold them in place when flat - rolling the excess strap material under the elastic might work though. The Aer strap adjustment system that doesn't leave a loose end is much nicer. I also find the magnetic buckle much easier to operate but don't have much practice on the new Fidlock yet.",

            "body": "After purchasing the AER DS3 X-pac, I decided to add the DS2 Olive. The black was sold out, and the remaining colors (black camo, olive, and gray) were on sale for $47, so I decided to go with one of them. Here's what I thought of the two products\r  \n\r  \n1. the Olive color is darker than I was expecting, and while I appreciate that it retains the texture, stiffness, and look of the Codura 1680d fabric that came in Black, the color is very disappointing. Perhaps it would have been better if I had purchased the Gray. \r  \n\r  \n2. the Fidlock on the DS3 is a better system than the traditional buckle on the DS2. Unlike the DS2, the DS3 doesn't have a finishing strap to close the belt, which I personally think looks very clean.\r  \n\r  \n3. The DS2 is like the DS3 stretched out on its side - it holds more (4.5L vs 3L) and looks more like a hot dog as a result. I find the lack of a handle on the back of the DS2 particularly frustrating. \r  \n\r  \n4. The X-Pac is a good material and fabric, but it does look flimsy at times. However, unlike my experience with the Tech pack2, the waterproof zipper on the DS3 X-pac opened and closed smoothly.",

            "body": "I got my Alpaka Metro Sling v2 today and so far, I am really impressed with it! I previously owned the Vertical Sling and this is just better in every way.\n\n  \nWhat I like about the bag: \n\n- It can pretty easily hold my in-flight essentials. I bought this bag because I wanted to easily store my in-flight essentials outside of my personal item so that I could get to them easily, but not lose them in the seatback pocket.\n\n-The magnetic straps are so easy to take on and off! I hate gatekeeper clips with a passion because I am pretty weak and find it really difficult to get them off. This is so, so buttery smooth and can come off in an instant. With that and the top handle, it's really easy to turn this into a pouch, which I plan to do for in-flight travel.\n\n- The gussets on the side make this bag open really wide, making it easy to grab what you need even when the pack is filled pretty full. I still have room in the pack for more stuff, and those gussets make it feel like I don't have to remove everything to get what I want at the bottom.\n\nWhat I don't like: \n\n- The key tether works amazingly well and is much smoother than the old one used on the Vertical Sling. However, since it is called the HUB key tether, I would have hoped it would be compatible with the rest of the HUB system, and it is not. That's a huge missed opportunity IMO. I would have loved to be able to easily move my keys to my hub keychain and carabiner and I can't if I plan to use this HUB key tether.\n\n- Even though it's pretty roomy, I still wish for more. It seems like the zippers work their best when the bag is empty. I think that has to do with the weatherproofing aquaguard zippers, but I bet I will get used to it.\n\n-Weight. It is pretty heavy at 280g, but still pretty comfortable to wear. I haven't tested it for a long enough time to know if this is an issue or not yet.\n\n  \nOverall, this bag is a great upgrade for me, and it seems to check the boxes most important for my use case. I'll update the post if I have any more thoughts about the bag!",

            "body": "I got my Alpaka Metro Sling v2 today and so far, I am really impressed with it! I previously owned the Vertical Sling and this is just better in every way.\n\n  \nWhat I like about the bag: \n\n- It can pretty easily hold my in-flight essentials. I bought this bag because I wanted to easily store my in-flight essentials outside of my personal item so that I could get to them easily, but not lose them in the seatback pocket.\n\n-The magnetic straps are so easy to take on and off! I hate gatekeeper clips with a passion because I am pretty weak and find it really difficult to get them off. This is so, so buttery smooth and can come off in an instant. With that and the top handle, it's really easy to turn this into a pouch, which I plan to do for in-flight travel.\n\n- The gussets on the side make this bag open really wide, making it easy to grab what you need even when the pack is filled pretty full. I still have room in the pack for more stuff, and those gussets make it feel like I don't have to remove everything to get what I want at the bottom.\n\nWhat I don't like: \n\n- The key tether works amazingly well and is much smoother than the old one used on the Vertical Sling. However, since it is called the HUB key tether, I would have hoped it would be compatible with the rest of the HUB system, and it is not. That's a huge missed opportunity IMO. I would have loved to be able to easily move my keys to my hub keychain and carabiner and I can't if I plan to use this HUB key tether.\n\n- Even though it's pretty roomy, I still wish for more. It seems like the zippers work their best when the bag is empty. I think that has to do with the weatherproofing aquaguard zippers, but I bet I will get used to it.\n\n-Weight. It is pretty heavy at 280g, but still pretty comfortable to wear. I haven't tested it for a long enough time to know if this is an issue or not yet.\n\n  \nOverall, this bag is a great upgrade for me, and it seems to check the boxes most important for my use case. I'll update the post if I have any more thoughts about the bag!",

Funny thing is I actually won it via a 100 EUR voucher that I won on Mukama, so it would be fitting perfectly if I used this bag to win my next premium sling :)\n\n**Design**\n\nI have watched Aaron's review multiple times before I chose this sling, so I was pretty sure what I was getting. I was still pleasently surprised with the overall quality of the bag. I chose the Axoflux version, mainly because the green X-Pac version was not available at the time I was making the purhcase. After about 9 months of almost daily use, the bag still looks in perfect condition, it can withstand the power of a toddler very well! The features and organization of the bag is very well thought through, I have zero complaints here. I also find the strap extremely comfortable. As you can see, I often carry a lot and it never gets really heavy or uncomfortable. My only gripe is that the strap comes loose from time to time, which is annoying, but other than that, zero complaints. Maybe one more - the back pocket zipper is still extremely stiff. To be more precise, it's a little moody. Sometimes it flies open, sometimes I give up and let the pocket unzipped. I do carry my phone and wallet in there, but the pocket is nice and close against my body, so I don't worry about the items slipping out. But I was hoping it would become easier to unzip over time, maybe I just have to wait a little longer.\n\n**How it carries**\n\nThere is also a great flexibility to this sling. It can carry a lot with ease and also is extremely nice when there is a lot of space left. However, when you really pack it hard, it's a little cumbersome. The bag itself is not the lightest and the massive internal organization means that you can't really fit bigger items easily. Yes, I can fit a 1l bottle inside with no issue, but it just doesn't carry very nice. However, I often carry my 11\" iPad Pro and I barely notice it. What I mean is that if you choose the items wisely, the  bag is not obtrusive against your body, but if you put in bulky items, it can get uncomfortable quickly.\n\n**Pros and cons**\n\nAll-in-all, it's an amazing daily carry. Firstly, I found it a little too big for my needs, but the bag is so comfortable that I don't mind the extra capacity. It actually comes in handy very often. As my toddler gets older every day, I am actually starting to struggle with the capacity, but I understand that I would need something different for that. For everything else, the bag is just amazing and I get a lot of compliments while carrying it, especially from people who would previously never carry a slingbag in the first place.\n\n",

These moments are few but make me happy to own these new awesome mobile devices like the Legion Go.  I don't have room in my pack for the included legion case and wanted to try out some slings.  I tried the same slings with my Asus Ally pro and got wildly different results.  \n  \nSlings:  \nAlpaka Go Sling Mini *Best*. \nAlpaka Bravo Sling Mini V2 *Best Looking*. \nAdidas 3.0 *2nd Best Looking*. \n  \nWhile the bigger Adidas and Bravo Sling Mini were both exceptional for the Ally, the larger Legion Go didn't fit, so by detaching the controllers I thought they would fit fine, surprisingly did not!  The smaller Go Sling Mini had a lot of built in organization and really worked out perfect for the Legion Go.",

            "body": "I've yet to find how people make a picture post and add text to the bottom of it lol, I can't fit all this into the captions.  So here it goes:\n\nJust got in the Alpaka Go Sling Nano and wanted to post my impressions.  Its a nice little sling and it is basically sort of an Alpaka Tech Case Mini but with 4cm more thickness.  This makes it ideal for a very specific loadout that I have been searching small slings to fill.  Namely a Phone, a small 1\" sensor camera, some batteries/battery bank, and a cable or two with maybe some earplugs and space perhaps to fit my wallet or keys if I had no pockets.  I've got a lot of slings, and like to use the smallest one possible for any given use.  This one will probably see a lot of use as I go to a lot of concerts and events where they won't let me take a interchangeable lens camera, but will let me bring a point and shoot.\n\nI liked the Tech Case Mini, but ultimately it was too slim to fit what I wanted.  I then found the Wandrd Tech Bag Medium which was approx the same dimensions as the mini, but deeper allowing room for the camera.  The Tech Bag Medium, the internal layout easily takes the camera but its built more for  chargers and dongles, not really for a phone, also it only has one zipper, so as a sling it can be a reach.  The Wandrd, with its softer structure and shape/direction of mounts, also works better for waist carry (I seldom do it, but it works), the nano isn't really set up for that.\n\nThe Go Sling Nano has an ideal setup for both the phone and camera, the sleeve protecting the phone is a nice padded material do can protect the screen against the hard surfaces of anything else in there.  The front pocket also has a nice magnetic key fob (I probably won't use that, but its a value added).  The only other sling that had this setup I was looking for is the Bellroy Venture ready 2.5, which might be a smidge larger, but I tend to like the Bellroy four point strap mounting system more than this removable Alpaka set up, also the wider strap is nicer for me too.  That one is on the radar if some discounts hit on Black Friday.  I am quite happy with this nano though, I will probably retire the Wandrd out of light camera sling duty and have it mostly be mostly for tech chargers, power bricks, mice, etc.",

So, I just tested my x-e1 with an 18mm and lens hood, which is about 9.5cm deep x 13.5 wide and 8cm tall, very similar in shape. It will fit in there lens forward if nothing else is in the bag, but its maxed out depth wise.  It zips closed but I imagine it would get fiddly putting it and taking it out and in and zipping it open and closed a lot.  Actually it might be ok of you put it in lens up, it fits pretty nice in there that way and zips open and closed easier.  I’d forget about putting a phone in back or anything in the front pocket in there at the same time though.",

            "body": "I've yet to find how people make a picture post and add text to the bottom of it lol, I can't fit all this into the captions.  So here it goes:\n\nJust got in the Alpaka Go Sling Nano and wanted to post my impressions.  Its a nice little sling and it is basically sort of an Alpaka Tech Case Mini but with 4cm more thickness.  This makes it ideal for a very specific loadout that I have been searching small slings to fill.  Namely a Phone, a small 1\" sensor camera, some batteries/battery bank, and a cable or two with maybe some earplugs and space perhaps to fit my wallet or keys if I had no pockets.  I've got a lot of slings, and like to use the smallest one possible for any given use.  This one will probably see a lot of use as I go to a lot of concerts and events where they won't let me take a interchangeable lens camera, but will let me bring a point and shoot.\n\nI liked the Tech Case Mini, but ultimately it was too slim to fit what I wanted.  I then found the Wandrd Tech Bag Medium which was approx the same dimensions as the mini, but deeper allowing room for the camera.  The Tech Bag Medium, the internal layout easily takes the camera but its built more for  chargers and dongles, not really for a phone, also it only has one zipper, so as a sling it can be a reach.  The Wandrd, with its softer structure and shape/direction of mounts, also works better for waist carry (I seldom do it, but it works), the nano isn't really set up for that.\n\nThe Go Sling Nano has an ideal setup for both the phone and camera, the sleeve protecting the phone is a nice padded material do can protect the screen against the hard surfaces of anything else in there.  The front pocket also has a nice magnetic key fob (I probably won't use that, but its a value added).  The only other sling that had this setup I was looking for is the Bellroy Venture ready 2.5, which might be a smidge larger, but I tend to like the Bellroy four point strap mounting system more than this removable Alpaka set up, also the wider strap is nicer for me too.  That one is on the radar if some discounts hit on Black Friday.  I am quite happy with this nano though, I will probably retire the Wandrd out of light camera sling duty and have it mostly be mostly for tech chargers, power bricks, mice, etc.",

Something like their pro strap: https://alpakagear.com/products/pro-strap\n\nThat being said, I didn’t actually do this mod, but I’m like 90% sure it could work.

There’s so many adjustments you can make to get a good fit on the body.\n\nUnfortunately I used the left shoulder configuration and it caused me lots of sharp pain in my left shoulder. Didn’t even load the bag heavy.\n\nWhen I wore the bag reversed on my right shoulder I experienced no pain, so I started an exchange for the other configuration. I’m very sad because I’m right handed and wanted the ease of access for myself.\n\nNow I’m probably gonna be waiting a good while before I can try this bag again. \n\nDespite the pain, I do think it’s a great bag. Wish my body wasn’t weird. Was still fun to take it out for a good walk.\n\nI’ll be sticking with my Go-Sling for now.",

There’s so many adjustments you can make to get a good fit on the body.\n\nUnfortunately I used the left shoulder configuration and it caused me lots of sharp pain in my left shoulder. Didn’t even load the bag heavy.\n\nWhen I wore the bag reversed on my right shoulder I experienced no pain, so I started an exchange for the other configuration. I’m very sad because I’m right handed and wanted the ease of access for myself.\n\nNow I’m probably gonna be waiting a good while before I can try this bag again. \n\nDespite the pain, I do think it’s a great bag. Wish my body wasn’t weird. Was still fun to take it out for a good walk.\n\nI’ll be sticking with my Go-Sling for now.",

Obviously, base specs state the Alpaka can pack more, but I’d like opinions based on usability. \n\nAs pictured, I currently have the Bellroy 9L. Love this bag except when traveling. Many times I need just that much more where I need to upgrade to a backpack. \nThe photo depicts a standard load for my Bellroy.

All the bags are advertised as either 6L or 9L.\n\nFirst up, the pack I use for every bag:\n\n[20oz Stanley water bottle, battery charger, wipes, wallet, beanie \\(gotta keep my head warm\\), protein shake, protein bar, keys, sunglasses, Airpods, and pen \\(not pictured\\).](https://preview.redd.it/mw20lo2uzwec1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acf8fcda7bed198cdac8cd32de515de5e9222ce7)\n\nI don't usually put my phone or a tablet (iPad mini is biggest I would imagine carrying around) in the sling.\n\n# First up: Aer Day Sling 3 Max\n\n[Main compartment - protein shake \\(under the water bottle\\) &amp; water bottle made the side pockets harder to use.](https://preview.redd.it/x7ijszgr1xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=792485d3189d4f397c13801214414d1ab8827395)\n\n[The rear cavity held my wallet.  It didn't really protrude into me, but flatter is better back here.](https://preview.redd.it/fz8ot9hr1xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29a64e070dd9eec0fef6219d5829e59dc4066ab4)\n\n[Keys, ID badge, and the AirPods  in the front, too.](https://preview.redd.it/v9hmnzgr1xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a691d351353170546ed699a1a35fdf58fb4d796)\n\n[Beanie on top of the main compartment.](https://preview.redd.it/jscyczgr1xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3b7cb94f792300357fa565a71d684a735356e81)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yegazgr1xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=489ba47e3dcd5dbaee3f7cd05dbd98d2143c8478\n\nEverything fit in and it closed.  I used this for a couple days until another bag showed up...\n\n# Second: Bellroy Venture Sling 9L\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Keys, Airpods, and battery charger in the front compartment.](https://preview.redd.it/faih8rxt2xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf7eb82c47a04745fff8c4f9227f40b090095085)\n\n[Everything is in there.  Nice to have the dedicated sunglasses area, though it's behind two zippers \\(main compartment zipper, sunglasses compartment zipper\\).  Wallet had to go here as there's no back compartment.](https://preview.redd.it/z0oxs0yt2xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64fae5407c52c8bdf43c95330a6f61b90e44f4a7)\n\n[Once again, beanie on top.](https://preview.redd.it/h7x2ptxt2xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02e8b51787383c96c7a8567d2b290de2d0734049)\n\nEverything closed up nicely.  You can see there's some room but not a lot.  Note: The Bellroy is the only bag rated at 9L in this comparison.\n\n# Third up: Alpaka Bravo Sling Pro\n\n[The material on the Pro is very tough and the packout is really tight.  Taking pictures was hard.  Keys attached to the keyleash in the front pocket.](https://preview.redd.it/romzr2lk3xec1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d6a30f789e8e3c7ca6bb73f6eae1ba5c40d42d7)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7qwlqkk3xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820c795a2451fea197e6ab13a8734a31eb60c30e\n\n[Front pocket is really tight](https://preview.redd.it/n0oy7rkk3xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed23125fea723972e04f6b4801639efa5cbf97f9)\n\n[Beanie and sunglasses on top](https://preview.redd.it/azd8fvkk3xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=670151ad19372a1a665ab0dc2f722ac94bb5997c)\n\n[What's under the beanie](https://preview.redd.it/jf9lovkk3xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89ee6e0496c03a9055118a5a03b24027526eca2c)\n\n[Rear compartment - tight pockets.  My wallet was a tight squeeze and hard to take in and out.](https://preview.redd.it/wz5qwwkk3xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca8dafdb56c005f76263e6c5030fdbce764c4061)\n\nThis pack was so tight I had a hard time opening and closing it.  I never actually wore it out and returned it without a second thought.  I really didn't like the material as well.  I'm pretty sure that's specific to the Pro model as it's the anti-cut material.  I think a softer, more flexible, material would've been better.\n\n# Fourth up: Defy Insidious Jr.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Insidious Jr. is tall enough for my shake to stand up.  Everything fits in with room to spare.](https://preview.redd.it/djjmcx0q8xec1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07732a7da5185c0f9a43b4fadf2cf5486d38d680)\n\n[As I don't have a tablet, I used the pocket for my beanie so it's not just on top of everything else.](https://preview.redd.it/wgh9vx0q8xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=813cb09fea3d8ccc4ffa227d98624afb3c2f9318)\n\n[I switched to a different battery charger - same capacity, just fatter and less long.](https://preview.redd.it/t5m78o0q8xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50a7cfb658d9871cea28a95856ccd5f5ede5bfe2)\n\n[Keys, sanitizing wipes, pen, airpods, and some lens wipes in the front pocket.](https://preview.redd.it/9gjctw0q8xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c43913a16e226df259446505fa01dd6b1bf22b19)\n\n[Plenty of organization](https://preview.redd.it/50529x0q8xec1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc44797e03ce87672cf29bd13801387c7c4989e5)\n\n# Winner: Defy Insidious Jr.!\n\nNot only did everything fit great, I like the look and the way it hangs.  The strap is epic (and reversible), I love the hi-visibility interior, and there was plenty of pockets/organization.  I know the look of the Defy bags is pretty tacticool (which I was not initially going for) but, especially for the size, it's the least \"mursey\", too.  The Bellroy is also a nice sling, but even with a \"larger\" capacity, it had less room than the Defy Insidious Jr..\n\nI've also recently received a Tom Bihn Side Hustle and Alpaka Bravo Sling Max (X-Pac).  I'll make a new post when I get those pics.\n\nI hope this post helps someone who is trying to find the best sling for them someday!",

The upside down zippered pockets annoyed the crap out of me though.  \n\nHowever!  I have my old school Timbuk2 messenger bag that I bought in 2007 and literally just had repaired for a tear this past December. I love that bag!  That is why I started with the Timbuk2 sling.",

I myself tend to gravitate to certain types of straps, and how the bags wear and are interacted with in general.  Cause I have the manybag bug just having a spread of sizes lets me dial in it.  I have the insidious (big dyneema), the strap on that is my favorite out of every bag I own.  The cobra buckle is heavy, but its on front so sort of works like a counterbalance with the bag on the back.",
