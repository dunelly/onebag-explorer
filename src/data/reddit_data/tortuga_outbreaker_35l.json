It also nicely compresses the jacket when packed.\n* 5 x quick-dry synthetic boxerbriefs ($20 each)\n* 3 x pairs of quick-dry synthetic sports socks ($7 pack of 3)\n\nOther\n\n* Sony A7 camera with kit lens, 16mm pancake lens, spare battery, and Pacsafe Z2 (The Z2 fits it *only just*)\n* Toilet bag with all the usual jazz and first-aid stuff\n* Sleeping bag liner (I will probably dump this in a couple of months if I find it's not useful)\n* UE Boom 2 (so worth the weight)\n* Mouse\n* Folding bluetooth headphones and headset (for Skype)\n* Misc electronics like USB charger, adapters, etc\n* Quick-dry towel\n* Trimmer ([this one](http://en.remington-europe.com/men/grooming/personal-groomers/groom-kit-lithium-personal-groomer-pg6160.html) - I chopped off the plug and soldered on a USB connection, it's 5V DC. It lives in the hanging toilet bag)\n\n**In the back laptop pocket:**\n\n* 14\" laptop\n* Wacom Intuos Small tablet (for photography)\n* Kobo Aura One (best eReader - actually the size of a book)\n* Laptop charger\n* 1TB SSD external drive\n* Misc cables\n\n**In the front pocket**\n\n* Passport\n* Playing cards\n* Earbuds\n* Notebook &amp; pen\n* Hikpro foldable day bag ($17, love this thing!)\n* Misc\n\n**In the hip-belt pockets**\n\n* Locks for hostels/lockers\n* Torch\n* Misc junk\n\n== Specs ==\n\nTotal weight is 9.5kg or 20 pounds. To get it on my flight I took the laptop and camera bag out.\n\nIf I take the camera bag out of the main bag I have tons of space. But I wanted to do a pack that had everything in one place so that when I'm on a bus I'm only keeping track of just one thing.\n\n== Review ==\n\nAsk me any questions and I'll add them to this section.\n\n**Likes:**\n\nI really, really like this bag. It has pretty much everything I want. I love that it looks like a shitty school bag rather than a backpack. If you look at the second photo you'll see that it's pretty damn small too. I'm 6'1 and it's super easy to carry and looks fine when I'm wearing it.\n\n* Doesn't look like a traveller's backpack (in my opinion)\n* Suitcase-style opening. Holy crap this is nice to use!\n* Fits everything\n* Really nice padding\n* Construction is great - feels like my gear is well protected\n* Laptop sits perfectly flat and the main compartment doesn't press onto it. With some other packs I was concerned that there would be a slight bow on the laptop from the pressure of the other spaces\n* Hipbelt works great\n* Really solid feeling zips\n* Waterproof for normal use\n\n**Dislikes:**\n\n* No two ways around it ... this bag is HEAVY just by itself. 2.15kg / 4.6 lbs\n* The side water pockets do not really expand to hold a water bottle. It's more that the side of the bag squashes inwards. If your bag is packed to the gills, then you ain't getting a bottle in there! It seems like a really weird oversight on a otherwise well-planned bag.\n* The TSA-style opening laptop pocket is wasted on me personally (since I avoid flying). I would have preferred a opening only at the top and to just drop the laptop down into the pocket. As it is, I have to unzip the back the entire way to get a few cables out, then zip it all the way back up so I can open up the main pocket and get the 3D items out like mouse/accessories. I try and only put flat items in the back pocket so they don't press on the laptop. It just adds an additional and annoying hassle.",

I pull it to the front… Xpac? Wtf? My pulse quickens. I’m looking for tags/labels anywhere and all I see is the turtle shell. Huh. I carry it over to the furniture section to investigate, and find 2 Herman Miller shell chairs (a story for another sub). Eventually I get to the layer with branding and figure out that it’s a Tortuga outbreaker (I think 35L?). And the best part- $24.99.\n\n\nI wasn’t looking for a pack like this, and honestly there’s a few features on this V1 that I’m not a fan of (the top handle being.. memory foam (?) and spandex with a small Xpac strip. No side handle? Water bottle pockets that won’t fit a 32oz bottle?) But at this price, I couldn’t say no!\n\n\nQuestions-  This thing is super clean shy of a few white scuffs on the exterior. No smells, which can be a thing sitting in the back room of a thrift shop. I’d love your ideas on how you’d go about cleaning/disinfecting the interior surfaces to a point that you’d feel comfortable using it for travel, having no knowledge of what was in it before. Lysol?  Also, does anyone know what the tubular zip pockets in the main compartment were designed for? Can’t figure out a use for them, previous owner had a crumpled supermarket produce bag in each one. Lastly, what other bag brands have a height adjustable shoulder strap system like this? I’m tall and love this feature.",

        "selftext": "I have always been one to pack light and easy. Often going on trips with nothing more than a duffel bag, but it was not with the same deliberative motives as this time.\n\nFor spring break, I went on a 10 day study abroad to France (Nancy, Bordeaux and Paris) and I am planning 9 weeks in Europe this summer. So 10 days was a great way to test and prep my one bag setup. As a test I also packed everything I was taking and went to class with it for about a week. That helped give some perspective on weight and accessibility.\n\nMy bag was the [Tortuga Outbreaker 35L](https://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/outbreaker-travel-backpack?variant=26900597257)\n\n[Tortuga Outbreaker 35L](https://preview.redd.it/gjkd1c795dqa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1c2082120b3d55066177ba9ae6ce7ecd12cf5ae)\n\nI thought this bag fit my needs well. Was initially unsure about how well I could condense to 35L. In the end I could probably reduce to 25 or 30L once I get a better packing sweatshirt. If I was wearing my bulkier clothing, almost half of the bag was empty. \n\nI don't bring a laptop, so I used laptop area to store my running gear. I would split my running clothes into different Ziploc bags and try to stuff it flat in the laptop pocket. It did a decent job of keeping smell contained. I'm not super happy with this solution and am open to suggestions on how to best manage my running clothing. \n\nThe downside of this bag was that one of the load bearing straps on the should started to break at the seam. After returning from my trip I contacted Tortuga and they politely and quickly offered to replace the bag no fuss. Hopefully this new bag stays together as it should.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Everything I brought](https://preview.redd.it/w28pkjtk6dqa1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e015b227feacd3fd09796f124618c3ca5f53348)\n\nSo for my packing list,\n\n**Electronics**\n\nPretty simple here. I do well with only a phone and no need for a laptop. Saves lots of space, weight and hassle. Biggest change will be the portable chargers going forward.\n\n* 2 USB-C cords\n* USB-micro cord\n* [Universal Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K66SY7M?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)\n* Kindle\n* Garmin + Charger\n* 2 portable chargers 10000mAh and 7500mAh\n   * Lost 1 of these and really only needed one. Having portable chargers needing USB-micro cords was really annoying. I have bought a new one that charges via USB-C.\n\n**Toiletries**\n\nI didn't bring soap and just planned to use hotel supplied. I will not be doing that going forward, its too unreliable. I plan on buying a matador soap bag and using bar soap going forward.\n\n* [Windtook Toiletry Bag](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKJV8JP?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)\n   * Bought this on a recommendation here. Its way too big for me. I only used one of the inner pouches and left the rest at home. The inner portion worked really well for me. May need to change some things not that I am bringing bar soap with me.\n* Toothbrush + paste\n* Glasses Cleaner\n* Beard Balm\n* Deodorant\n* First Aid kit\n   * I will be adding some individual pain killers to this that I was lacking.\n* [Microfiber Travel Towel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WCTYLFY?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)\n   * This was a great purchase. Having an easily pack able towel that dries pretty quick was fantastic. When drying off it doesn't feel the best but I like it for now.\n\n**Clothing** \n\nIt was hard to me to pare down to this, but after the trip I realized I didn't even use some of it. If I could've done laundry around the 1 week mark I think I would've been a bit happier. My sweatshirt got more use, and subsequent smell, than I was anticipating. Planning on that in the future.\n\n* 4x Underwear\n* 4x Socks\n   * 1x synthetic for running\n   * 2x wool for comfort\n   * 1x cotton blend\n* 6 shirts\n   * 3x [black tshirt](https://www.target.com/p/men-s-every-wear-short-sleeve-t-shirt-goodfellow-co/-/A-54247271?preselect=78206412#lnk=sametab) \n      * Picked these up at target the day before leaving. Best thing I packed\n   * 1x wool long sleeve\n      * Planned to run in. Did not use\n   * 1x long sleeve button down\n   * 1x running shirt\n* 4x pants\n   * 1x black slacks\n   * 1x jeans\n   * 1x black joggers\n   * 1x running shorts\n* 1x sweatshirt\n   * Bulky cotton, will be replacing with something lighter and more pack able for my summer trip.\n* [Patagonia Houdini](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-houdini-windbreaker-jacket/24142.html?dwvar_24142_color=BLK&amp;cgid=root) \n   * Wonderful jacket, saves so much space. Considering buying multiple for my car and other bags.\n\n**Misc/Other**\n\n* [Umbrella](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TJ8LB8C?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)\n   * With the Houdini, this felt unnecessary. Don't think the umbrella will make the list for future trips.\n* Passport\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think that is my whole list. The wonders of r/onebag really show when traveling with people that have checked bags. Out of my 20 person trip I was the only one with one bag. Everyone else with 1 checked bag, carry on, and backpack were so slow compared to me. Going around France's public transit with all of that luggage was cumbersome to say the least, where I could breeze through without a second thought.\n\nI will be continuing to hone my packing list for the future, maybe a new bag after this next trip as a treat. If anyone has suggestions on changes I could make I'd love to hear them. Thanks for reading.",

A fleece and Houdini will take you far. For your summer trip I recommend a light Merino “dress” style sweater. Really good ones are $12.95 at my local Goodwill. They look dressier than a fleece and you get the anti odor properties of wool. \n\nAdd a long sleeve light colored tee to use for layering and sun/bug protection too.  Old Navy Core tees are cheap on sale and have odor control treatment. \n\n\nI’m a fan of polo shirts too. It’s just a tee shirt with a collar but a step up in formality. \n\nI would cut down on pants, especially the jeans. My usual kit is one spare pair of long pants and one pair of walking shorts. I have recently adopted hybrid shorts and they pack well and can be used for beach and street with no significant compromises. \n\nIf you plan to go to 30 liters, the Patagonia Refugio is 2.75 pounds lighter than your Outbreaker! It could use a few ounces of packing cubes.",

Double the weight of Synapse25, imagine Synapse25 fully packed, that is AER TP3 empty. Too many organizations I dont need and I will not use.

            "body": "Just got my Cotopaxi Allpa 35 from the indigogo purchase.  This thing is pretty darn sweet!  I used it on a 3 day work trip, one bagging it.  It was pretty tight as I had to take more clothes than I would normally travel with because of certain events, etc., but overall, I was very happy with the setup of the bag, it's organizational options, and accessories.\n\nI did have to take off my mesh bottle holder in order to close the door on that tiny ass CRJ overhead bin, but it fit in there wonderfully. Obviously, if I didn't have 1L nalgene in the pocket, it wouldn't have been a problem. :)\n\nI did empty the bag into my hotel room dresser because I didn't have room to put something else to carry my laptop in, I worried that maybe being empty, the backpack would be floppy and annoying or look goofy as it's a pretty sizable bag, however, it worked great to carry my tablet and 15\" laptop around as the only real contents besides cables and a couple other random things.\n\nZippers are great, the anti-theft straps are pretty cool, but can be annoying if you're in a hurry, so basically, only put the zippers behind those locks after you've gone through the security line!\n\nShoulder straps are good, I didn't try the belt straps as I wanted to be quick on/off, so I tucked the belt straps inside the stowage area.\n\nNot sure if people want more pictures.  This bag unzips to open like a suitcase... with organizers on each side.  Separate zip area for the top for quick access... a sneaky way into the main compartment on one side and padded laptop and tablet sleeve access on the other.\n\nI think this backpack is going to be my 'go to' travel bag from now on!  It is carry-on size compliant and has wonderful organization within it.",

The top section that is easily accessible has enough space and organization to keep essentials for when you're at the airport with quick access.\n\nI wouldn't want anything heavier probably... loaded up this is comfortable, but anything more and you'd want more robust straps for shoulder and waist... something like my Osprey Atmos AG 50.\n\nI would potentially use a biner to attach some things, but not much, the beauty of this bag is it's streamlined and won't catch on stuff.\n\nWater bottle sleeve seemed decent, however, I will be fully honest, I didn't actually ever remove my Nalgene or fill it... the place I went to was supplying bottled water, so I didn't see a point to transfer to my bottle.  So I can't speak to it being easy or difficult to remove and reinsert into the mesh pocket.\n\nI love the 4 handles on the outside, it makes moving the bag around in a plane or trunk very easy.  The tuckaway hip belt is nice, I didn't use it this trip as I was just doing minimal walking... car &gt; airport &gt; tram &gt; car &gt; hotel, and reverse... no wandering at all.\n\nI'm very happy with it, can't wait to use it for some exploring!",

Day hike in Kamikochi, another minor hike close to an onsen we stayed at in Nagano. Almost exclusively public transportation (trains, subway, eventually buses). 28 hours in transit into and back from Japan, so extra comfort and entertainment were necessary\n\nFavorite gear for this trip:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Adidas Free Hikers - I love these, extremely comfortable and versatile. Great for all kinds of weather, including rainy days. I think they look ok when worn with casual clothing and even jeans, unlike the new model.\n* Public Rec ADED Joggers - Used for transit days, hiking. if you need to take two 10+ hour flights in a row, you need something really comfy and these are the comfiest pants I own and do not look sloppy like sweatpants. Has great zippered pockets on the side and back which are great for transit days and overall utility.\n* Naturehike Xpac passport pouch - I’m absolutely paranoid about losing documents. I clipped this with my passport and our JR passes to the key clip in the side pocket of the CPP and not once had that typical nervous pocket check during travel. If I carry this on my pant pocket, I sometimes use the D-ring to clip it to a belt loop.\n* Columbia Watertight II - I paid 50 bucks for this thing and it worked wonderfully in constant, heavy-ish rain (a few days only fortunately) and windier days. Packs into one of the pockets easily. I love the color (warm copper). For a summer trip or 25+ C degrees, I’d bring my umbrella, as it’s not breathable.\n\nAbout the City Pack Pro and my packing strategy\n\nMy usual onebag(ish) setup is the Incase Tracto Duffel backpack (Danny’s packs review here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huhEZGCJDLg&amp;t=141s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huhEZGCJDLg&amp;t=141s)) that I got on ebay for 75 bucks a few years ago plus a packable backpack (currently the Tortuga Outbreaker Daypack - bought 2nd hand from someone on Reddit), but I thought that setup had room for improvement, as the Incase does not work well for EDC, as it’s too large and too deep for that. I always carry a single volume on the way out of my country but not always on the way back (but never check!), as stuff is generally cheaper and I get variety I don’t have at home (developing country with huge import taxes). I like that it has the duffel strap and that the backpack straps are stowable in case I bring too much stuff on the way back and have to “twobag” with the packable daypack and I’m not afraid at all of having it gate checked, as it’s very sturdy and has lockable zippers.\n\nI was mostly uninterested in AER bags for travel because I thought they were too heavy and already had my main bag, but when the CPP launched, I got interested, as I wanted a personal item sized backpack (closer to 45 x 30 x 20 cm) that could work as a smaller travel bag and the CPP was significantly lighter than Aer’s travel focused bags. I thought I’d keep my electronics and more delicate items like some souvenirs in it and have a better EDC bag during the trip and maybe use something packable on the way back if I have overflow or want to buy something larger.\n\nI’m not an ultralight guy and I’m not trying to be, but the benefits of carrying less are obvious, particularly if you’re carrying a bag all day. I also dislike carrying delicate stuff on bags with no structure like most packable and ultralight bags (which make you add more pouches, cases, sleeves, etc. and/or be concerned about damage) and thought the CPP had an ok volume to weight to structure ratio and compartments that could work for my use case.\n\nThis was the first major trip I took with the CPP. I used it previously on a grocery run with around 11 kg and noticed that above a certain weight threshold it will get uncomfortable. On the way into Japan, I had a smidge over 8 kg in total weight - the bag was very comfortable at that zone. I had none of the pulling back feeling a lot of reviewers mentioned.\n\nI loved the compartments - toiletries on the lower front, electronics at the upper front, power bank and passport on the side, packing cube, jackets and camera on the main compartment, all very easy to get to during the trip. I didn’t bring a dopp kit and a tech pouch which I would regularly do with the Incase. I only brought a case for my glasses because I brought sunnies and rx - one of them went into the fleece lined top pocket. The X-Pac is awesome - a few very rainy days were no problem and any dirt basically just wipes off.\n\nI was always curious on how much would actually fit the CPP. I brought a lot of “luxury” items - a second camera lens, my GF’s camera, the largest power bank I own, the NYXI controller that took a lot of space, my eyeglasses, etc.. If I didn’t, I would probably be able to fit a whole week of clothing or maybe a second pair of flatter shoes like Nike Frees, so yeah, CPP works great as a travel bag.\n\nI knew I might bring some stuff from Japan that would not fit the CPP (there’s sooooo much cool stuff to bring over that’s not available elsewhere) and I was ok with that. One of the things I bought was the Matador 25 On Grid duffle, which turned out to be a great overflow bag - I basically just moved my packing cube and dry toiletries to it and had the whole main CPP compartment for the more delicate stuff I wanted to bring back. Duffels work great if you don’t have much weight in them, particularly for clothing. The packing cube gives it a bit more structure so it’s easier to carry.\n\nI ended up liking this new setup more than I liked my previous one and I think it will likely be my new default one. Happy to answer all questions on the bag and other gear I’ve brought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdits: typo, formatting",

                "body": "I considered several along the way, including the ULA Dragonfly (too long for personal item measurements, unavailable in Xpac for a long time), the Topo Mountain Pack (too long, concerned about durability for new model), Osprey 26+6 (can't stand the looks, flimsier appearance), Thule Aion 28 (very disappointed when I saw it in person), Prvke 31 (too long, too heavy), Mystery Ranch Catalyst 26 (too long). One thing that I don't think most people care about but I do is width - for these smaller bags, being ≥30 cm wide allows me to pack my packing cube sideways and pack shoes sideways as well (mine are 27 cm - around 8.5-9 US), which helps a lot fitting all the stuff I need for every kind of trip, freeing room around the top for jackets, toiletries, etc.. The fact that it was xpac and that I could get it for cheaper played a big role in my choice for the CPP too, but overall measures vs weight were very important. I also wouldn't buy a bag without a decent pack panel and the CPP is great on that front.",

I’ve used it for hiking during a more recent trip to Chapada Diamantina, Brazil and it was fine. The only thing about the CPP I’m not 100% happy about it the lower front pocket that could have a bit more depth. Also if you own more of Aer stuff, the Slim Pouch was designed to fit the upper front pocket perfectly, it’s a great match and I own it too",
