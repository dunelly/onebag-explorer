            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

Not only it means that it will dirty faster, but it also isn't waterproof from the bottom: a bummer, seeing as I took Prima snowboarding and was perfectly fine.  \nAlso....**loops**. The sheer amount of nipple clips, snaps, loops and hoops in and out is honestly too much. I am a big fan of accessories and carry a strapped EDC torchlight and carabiner or two on my bagpack, but the Errant Pro just has so many things that while not getting in the way (well...so far. I think the loop in the front hatch pocket will annoy me), just take a little space and form a question mark in my head everytime I see it. Like the elastic loops on the velcro inner in the main compartment. The fabric loops that are on the backside of the main compartment, normally covered by a divider.  \nThe snap buttons that don't even fit my Port kit from Boundary Supply, inside and up. The multitude of small loops on the outside.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

Not only it means that it will dirty faster, but it also isn't waterproof from the bottom: a bummer, seeing as I took Prima snowboarding and was perfectly fine.  \nAlso....**loops**. The sheer amount of nipple clips, snaps, loops and hoops in and out is honestly too much. I am a big fan of accessories and carry a strapped EDC torchlight and carabiner or two on my bagpack, but the Errant Pro just has so many things that while not getting in the way (well...so far. I think the loop in the front hatch pocket will annoy me), just take a little space and form a question mark in my head everytime I see it. Like the elastic loops on the velcro inner in the main compartment. The fabric loops that are on the backside of the main compartment, normally covered by a divider.  \nThe snap buttons that don't even fit my Port kit from Boundary Supply, inside and up. The multitude of small loops on the outside.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

Not only it means that it will dirty faster, but it also isn't waterproof from the bottom: a bummer, seeing as I took Prima snowboarding and was perfectly fine.  \nAlso....**loops**. The sheer amount of nipple clips, snaps, loops and hoops in and out is honestly too much. I am a big fan of accessories and carry a strapped EDC torchlight and carabiner or two on my bagpack, but the Errant Pro just has so many things that while not getting in the way (well...so far. I think the loop in the front hatch pocket will annoy me), just take a little space and form a question mark in my head everytime I see it. Like the elastic loops on the velcro inner in the main compartment. The fabric loops that are on the backside of the main compartment, normally covered by a divider.  \nThe snap buttons that don't even fit my Port kit from Boundary Supply, inside and up. The multitude of small loops on the outside.",

        "selftext": "This has been my dream bag for a couple years. I originally got the 5.11 AMP 24 on sale as my budget consolation bag. That bag has been great, I’ve taken it on medevac missions in the desert and kayaking through icebergs and everything in between. But when I saw the gamut overland on close out sale, I couldn’t resist. My use case is a bag that I carry everywhere all the time, and also take on demanding adventures. Also I carry armor and a gun at all times. A bag that supports my mission is a must—and I highly value customizability.\n\n       First Impressions:\n\nThe bag is big—perfect for me. Smallest end of multi day travel/backpacking bags and largest end of edc/school/work bags.\n\nIncredibly well made/heavy duty. Almost over built. Laminated Cordura on outside AND 500D Cordura liner inside, padded at the bottom, double stitched, tac barred, the whole 9 yards.\n\nAnd most importantly, everything feels intuitive and well designed. Extremely high quality, even above the 511.\n\n       Organization:\n\nPretty much the same as the gamut 2.0. I utilized my 5.11 AMP Velcro modules, and laid out my Medkit and toolkit and electronics/admin pouch all on velcro. I laced bungee through the front face molle and used that to store my pepper spray, and the tool pouches under the lid are perftecr for my flashlight and knife and some pens etc.\n\n        Complaints:\n\nMy biggest complaint is with the internal “frames”. There are 2 of them, one before the gun panel and one after the gun panel. I think they’re mostly there to mitigate printing, but they do nothing to maintain the bags structure when it is heavily loaded. Also, the framein front of the gun panel not only does nothing for comfort since your gun will still push into your back, but that’s where you put pack pack armor, so you don’t even gain added support from your armor. 1 stiffer, well formed frame behind the gun panel (against your back, like a frame should be) would have been far superior and more weight efficient. I haven’t had a chance to really ruck or long hike with it yet, I will update when I do.\n\nMy second biggest complaint is a lack of exterior attachment options. I always have this complaint. I can never have enough daisy chains and pig snouts and etc\n\nAlso, a couple pockets and/or Velcro on the internal sides would have been nice.  \n\nAlso, my Nalgene was a little too much for the water bottle pocket, and it tore slightly.\n\n       Modifications:\n\nFirst I impregnated it with silicone. This strengthens and protects the fabric. Plenty of tutorials on the internet about how to do this, super cheap and easy. It’s a must for any performance bag. Obviously it didn’t take too well on the PU, but it worked a charm in the nylon. I might do another treatment, I don’t want to oversaturate the fabric though.\n\nNext I took the frame out of my 511 and put it in my gamut. I squeezed it in the luggage pass through spot and it was the perfect size and added much needed rigidity.\n\nPerhaps my favourite mod was stitching leather lashing tabs on. I found the perfect spot, I might add more on top, but at least for now I can lash a sleeping roll on bottom if I want.\n\nThen I laced the otherwise bland carry handle with paracord. This is a fun and functional upgrade. (But the basic carry handle is forgiven because the front rubberized hyperlon nook is without a doubt the best grab handle on any bag period.)\n\nI want to replace the main zipper pulls with leather tabs, like I did with my amp (I made a post about it) but I can’t figure out a good way yet. Let me know if you think of one.\n\n       Conclusion:\n\nIt’s hard to think of a better possible do everything bag. From the classroom to the apocalypse, this bag is unmatched in customizability and durability. It’s only real competition might be the Nomadic Research Raid Pack.\n\nThanks for reading, let me know if you have any questions or mod suggestions.",

        "selftext": "This has been my dream bag for a couple years. I originally got the 5.11 AMP 24 on sale as my budget consolation bag. That bag has been great, I’ve taken it on medevac missions in the desert and kayaking through icebergs and everything in between. But when I saw the gamut overland on close out sale, I couldn’t resist. My use case is a bag that I carry everywhere all the time, and also take on demanding adventures. Also I carry armor and a gun at all times. A bag that supports my mission is a must—and I highly value customizability.\n\n       First Impressions:\n\nThe bag is big—perfect for me. Smallest end of multi day travel/backpacking bags and largest end of edc/school/work bags.\n\nIncredibly well made/heavy duty. Almost over built. Laminated Cordura on outside AND 500D Cordura liner inside, padded at the bottom, double stitched, tac barred, the whole 9 yards.\n\nAnd most importantly, everything feels intuitive and well designed. Extremely high quality, even above the 511.\n\n       Organization:\n\nPretty much the same as the gamut 2.0. I utilized my 5.11 AMP Velcro modules, and laid out my Medkit and toolkit and electronics/admin pouch all on velcro. I laced bungee through the front face molle and used that to store my pepper spray, and the tool pouches under the lid are perftecr for my flashlight and knife and some pens etc.\n\n        Complaints:\n\nMy biggest complaint is with the internal “frames”. There are 2 of them, one before the gun panel and one after the gun panel. I think they’re mostly there to mitigate printing, but they do nothing to maintain the bags structure when it is heavily loaded. Also, the framein front of the gun panel not only does nothing for comfort since your gun will still push into your back, but that’s where you put pack pack armor, so you don’t even gain added support from your armor. 1 stiffer, well formed frame behind the gun panel (against your back, like a frame should be) would have been far superior and more weight efficient. I haven’t had a chance to really ruck or long hike with it yet, I will update when I do.\n\nMy second biggest complaint is a lack of exterior attachment options. I always have this complaint. I can never have enough daisy chains and pig snouts and etc\n\nAlso, a couple pockets and/or Velcro on the internal sides would have been nice.  \n\nAlso, my Nalgene was a little too much for the water bottle pocket, and it tore slightly.\n\n       Modifications:\n\nFirst I impregnated it with silicone. This strengthens and protects the fabric. Plenty of tutorials on the internet about how to do this, super cheap and easy. It’s a must for any performance bag. Obviously it didn’t take too well on the PU, but it worked a charm in the nylon. I might do another treatment, I don’t want to oversaturate the fabric though.\n\nNext I took the frame out of my 511 and put it in my gamut. I squeezed it in the luggage pass through spot and it was the perfect size and added much needed rigidity.\n\nPerhaps my favourite mod was stitching leather lashing tabs on.

Also I carry armor and a gun at all times. A bag that supports my mission is a must—and I highly value customizability.\n\n       First Impressions:\n\nThe bag is big—perfect for me. Smallest end of multi day travel/backpacking bags and largest end of edc/school/work bags.\n\nIncredibly well made/heavy duty. Almost over built. Laminated Cordura on outside AND 500D Cordura liner inside, padded at the bottom, double stitched, tac barred, the whole 9 yards.\n\nAnd most importantly, everything feels intuitive and well designed. Extremely high quality, even above the 511.\n\n       Organization:\n\nPretty much the same as the gamut 2.0. I utilized my 5.11 AMP Velcro modules, and laid out my Medkit and toolkit and electronics/admin pouch all on velcro. I laced bungee through the front face molle and used that to store my pepper spray, and the tool pouches under the lid are perftecr for my flashlight and knife and some pens etc.\n\n        Complaints:\n\nMy biggest complaint is with the internal “frames”. There are 2 of them, one before the gun panel and one after the gun panel. I think they’re mostly there to mitigate printing, but they do nothing to maintain the bags structure when it is heavily loaded. Also, the framein front of the gun panel not only does nothing for comfort since your gun will still push into your back, but that’s where you put pack pack armor, so you don’t even gain added support from your armor. 1 stiffer, well formed frame behind the gun panel (against your back, like a frame should be) would have been far superior and more weight efficient. I haven’t had a chance to really ruck or long hike with it yet, I will update when I do.\n\nMy second biggest complaint is a lack of exterior attachment options. I always have this complaint. I can never have enough daisy chains and pig snouts and etc\n\nAlso, a couple pockets and/or Velcro on the internal sides would have been nice.  \n\nAlso, my Nalgene was a little too much for the water bottle pocket, and it tore slightly.\n\n       Modifications:\n\nFirst I impregnated it with silicone. This strengthens and protects the fabric. Plenty of tutorials on the internet about how to do this, super cheap and easy. It’s a must for any performance bag. Obviously it didn’t take too well on the PU, but it worked a charm in the nylon. I might do another treatment, I don’t want to oversaturate the fabric though.\n\nNext I took the frame out of my 511 and put it in my gamut. I squeezed it in the luggage pass through spot and it was the perfect size and added much needed rigidity.\n\nPerhaps my favourite mod was stitching leather lashing tabs on. I found the perfect spot, I might add more on top, but at least for now I can lash a sleeping roll on bottom if I want.\n\nThen I laced the otherwise bland carry handle with paracord. This is a fun and functional upgrade. (But the basic carry handle is forgiven because the front rubberized hyperlon nook is without a doubt the best grab handle on any bag period.)\n\nI want to replace the main zipper pulls with leather tabs, like I did with my amp (I made a post about it) but I can’t figure out a good way yet. Let me know if you think of one.\n\n       Conclusion:\n\nIt’s hard to think of a better possible do everything bag. From the classroom to the apocalypse, this bag is unmatched in customizability and durability. It’s only real competition might be the Nomadic Research Raid Pack.\n\nThanks for reading, let me know if you have any questions or mod suggestions.",

        "selftext": "I was looking for a backpack reminiscent of the Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault, which I've been very fond of, but it was too tactically inclined.\n\nThe bag is very well proportioned, and the small pockets and mesh pockets are incredibly effective for organizing my EDC gear. The two mesh pockets on the sides are very shallow, almost too shallow for anything other than a wallet and keys; here they could have easily been made deeper, similar to the 2 Day Assault. Both the color and overall profile make it very urban and fit well in all environments, from the office to travel without standing out among the crowd.\n\n75% of the backpack's contact area is primarily on the lower back. There is very little contact with the rest of the back when walking; it requires very careful adjustment to get more contact with the backpack in the upper part of the back, and it varies quite a bit depending on how much weight is in the backpack.\n\nThe load lifters on the straps are very welcome, as the backpack tends to pull and lean slightly backward if not tightened. Especially in the beginning, this was an awkward sensation and caused discomfort in the upper back and shoulders, but it has improved significantly after getting to know the adjustments better.\n\nThe length of the backpack is fine and very similar to a Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault with the back panel set in the middle position. I am 180 cm tall (5.9 feet), and both the harness and the length of the bag fit well.\n\nThe zippers are some of the most functional I've seen in a long time. There are small loops at all ends of the zippers, making it incredibly easy to zip. It's a very functional tri-zip backpack. The new zipper pulls are also super grippy; I wish more manufacturers used similar pulls.\n\nThe bag is relatively waterproof; for the most part, the rain sits directly on top of the fabric and slides off.\n\nThe non-elastic bottle pockets on the sides are effective; however, they lack the option to be tightened at the top, as bottles easily slide out when the bag is lying horizontally, for example, in the overhead compartment of a plane or train.\n\nThe divided laptop compartment is one of the best laptop compartments I have seen. If I were a university student needing to carry books, folders, a laptop, and possibly an iPad, I would not hesitate to choose the Catalyst 26 as one of the best options, despite room for improvement. Compared to the Urban Assault, which largely disappointed on all fronts, the Catalyst is light-years ahead in both ergonomics and internal organization.",

        "selftext": "I was looking for a backpack reminiscent of the Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault, which I've been very fond of, but it was too tactically inclined.\n\nThe bag is very well proportioned, and the small pockets and mesh pockets are incredibly effective for organizing my EDC gear. The two mesh pockets on the sides are very shallow, almost too shallow for anything other than a wallet and keys; here they could have easily been made deeper, similar to the 2 Day Assault. Both the color and overall profile make it very urban and fit well in all environments, from the office to travel without standing out among the crowd.\n\n75% of the backpack's contact area is primarily on the lower back. There is very little contact with the rest of the back when walking; it requires very careful adjustment to get more contact with the backpack in the upper part of the back, and it varies quite a bit depending on how much weight is in the backpack.\n\nThe load lifters on the straps are very welcome, as the backpack tends to pull and lean slightly backward if not tightened. Especially in the beginning, this was an awkward sensation and caused discomfort in the upper back and shoulders, but it has improved significantly after getting to know the adjustments better.\n\nThe length of the backpack is fine and very similar to a Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault with the back panel set in the middle position. I am 180 cm tall (5.9 feet), and both the harness and the length of the bag fit well.\n\nThe zippers are some of the most functional I've seen in a long time. There are small loops at all ends of the zippers, making it incredibly easy to zip. It's a very functional tri-zip backpack. The new zipper pulls are also super grippy; I wish more manufacturers used similar pulls.\n\nThe bag is relatively waterproof; for the most part, the rain sits directly on top of the fabric and slides off.\n\nThe non-elastic bottle pockets on the sides are effective; however, they lack the option to be tightened at the top, as bottles easily slide out when the bag is lying horizontally, for example, in the overhead compartment of a plane or train.\n\nThe divided laptop compartment is one of the best laptop compartments I have seen. If I were a university student needing to carry books, folders, a laptop, and possibly an iPad, I would not hesitate to choose the Catalyst 26 as one of the best options, despite room for improvement. Compared to the Urban Assault, which largely disappointed on all fronts, the Catalyst is light-years ahead in both ergonomics and internal organization.",

Wide, thickly padded straps, load lifters, micro-adjustable sternum strap, and a really nice hip belt make this a very comfortable carry. Doubt I’ll really need the hip belt but definitely a nice option to stow it or remove it. \n\n-has just the right amount of organization. The two bottom pocket on the inside of the lid have built in volume to them. Was able to fit my Gravel Mini and Evergoods CAP.5 in one without issue or impeding on the main compartment. \n\n-tons of attachment points, counter pulls, and zipper security loops\n\n-top QAP is felt lined for sunglasses or other scratchable items\n\n-front admin pocket fits a CAP1 plus items in the built in pocketing. This does reduce the effectiveness of the top split pocket inside the lid. \n\n-hidden pocket in back panel is perfect for an AirTag and your passport\n\n-the bottle pocket is great stretch mesh and the loop on it for easy access is a nice addition\n\n\nThings I Wished It Had:\n\n-wish they had kept the grid pattern bottom of the 45\n\n-would have rather a 2nd water bottle pocket over the side handle since there’s already 4 handles on the front\n\n-wish it had compression straps inside to really flatten out my Peak Design cubes but not a big deal\n\nAll in all this is absolutely a keeper for me and has made it onto my bag wall.

        "selftext": "Got in the new Matador Globerider 35 a week ago in garnet, an awesome colorway. Did some test loading and carrying (about 18 pounds of gear) and the harness felt fantastic, especially with the hip belt engaged. \n\nThings I Love:\n\n-the colorway\n\n-dual access to the main compartment makes this easy to pack smart, and get quick access to whatever you leave on top, along with the laptop\n\n-the harness is fantastic. Wide, thickly padded straps, load lifters, micro-adjustable sternum strap, and a really nice hip belt make this a very comfortable carry. Doubt I’ll really need the hip belt but definitely a nice option to stow it or remove it. \n\n-has just the right amount of organization. The two bottom pocket on the inside of the lid have built in volume to them. Was able to fit my Gravel Mini and Evergoods CAP.5 in one without issue or impeding on the main compartment. \n\n-tons of attachment points, counter pulls, and zipper security loops\n\n-top QAP is felt lined for sunglasses or other scratchable items\n\n-front admin pocket fits a CAP1 plus items in the built in pocketing. This does reduce the effectiveness of the top split pocket inside the lid. \n\n-hidden pocket in back panel is perfect for an AirTag and your passport\n\n-the bottle pocket is great stretch mesh and the loop on it for easy access is a nice addition\n\n\nThings I Wished It Had:\n\n-wish they had kept the grid pattern bottom of the 45\n\n-would have rather a 2nd water bottle pocket over the side handle since there’s already 4 handles on the front\n\n-wish it had compression straps inside to really flatten out my Peak Design cubes but not a big deal\n\nAll in all this is absolutely a keeper for me and has made it onto my bag wall. Will be my 3-4 day business trip bag. ",

            "body": "dude, the globerider 35 is such a solid pack. the harness system really is next level, especially for the price point. those wide, padded straps with the load lifters make a huge difference when you’re carrying weight—18lbs is no joke, but it sounds like it handled it like a champ. \n\nthe dual access is a game changer too. being able to get into the main compartment from the top or the front is so clutch for organization and quick grabs. i had a similar setup on my last pack, and it made airport travel way less of a headache. \n\nalso, garnet colorway? fire choice. it’s always nice when a pack looks as good as it performs. \n\nbtw there’s the anniversary sale going on on aliexpress which makes the miyoo mini plus $32 right now if you’re interested.

            "body": "I received this bag in late January and have been using it as a daily carry ever since, including a couple of weekend trips and longer 1 week trip to Costa Rica. \n\nOverall, the bag really has a unique look and feel. The metal buckles, the AquaGuard zippers, and the color really make this bag stand out. Overall I have been really happy with the function of the bag. Being able to strip everything out for a minimal daily carry is great, but when I need to work remotely or carry some camera gear on weekend trip I can just add the pieces I need and go. With that said, I have a few gripes with the bag:\n\n1. The bag is HEAVY. Empty with all of the different parts inside it is almost 5lbs. Start adding cameras, a laptop, a tablet, and all of the other stuff you would need on a trip and this bag gets over 25-30lbs. very quickly. I will say that the bag sits great on your bag and it doesn’t feel that heavy when you wear it. You notice this weight the most when you are moving the bag around by the handle. \n\n2. The lighter color of the fabric is starting to show some scrapes and wear, this is occurring mostly around the water bottle pocket that stickers out on the bag when you have a bottle in. \n\n3. Speaking of the water bottle holder, I am really not a fan. When the bag is fully loaded it becomes very narrow and my water bottle doesn’t fit fully into the pocket. It’s also held close to the bad with a thin strip of elastic. This is great at first because it keeps the pocket flush against the bag when not in use. But after heavy use, the elastic is now stretched out and it doesn’t sit as tight against the bag as it once did. \n\nThis bag really works for anyone who wants a modular system that can be used for daily carry, weekend trips, and longer trips if you’re bringing another bag. While it is a bit expensive, I can see owning and using this bag for many years to come. Let me know if you are on the fence absolutely buying and if you have any questions I can answer for you. \n\n\n",

With that said, the metal buckets are so much fun I really don’t mind. \n\n2. Materials are great. Like I said earlier, some small scrapping on the side of the bag, but it doesn’t not attract lint or hair or sand like other bags. \n\n3. Back panel doesn’t bug me at all. It is a little stiff, but that helps give it some rigid-ness and allows it to easily slide onto the handles of a roller suit case. This was a great feature that I have not had in a backpack before. \n\n4. Verge case is a bit of a pain. I only kept it in the bag while traveling then took it out when I got settled. There people is probably 6” of space under the verge case when it is placed in the bag so you have to get creative and stuff things you won’t need quick access to in there. ",

The only downside is that it is a little heavy since the materials are thick and padded, so for a daily carry it might be more than you need/want.

I did just jump into this blindly, but I saw the bag and fell in love with the design and look.\n\nThe EXM bag came first, came in 2-3 days after my order, but was not notified that it had been shipped. Then I waited one month before I received my backpack and right now, I'm still waiting for my hemp laundry bag.\n\nWhen I received the EXM bag, it was scratched up, I emailed and was given a few options. So that was resolved rather quickly. Although, having to wait for almost two months for a laundry hemp bag is pretty annoying, especially when they give no notifications to why it's late or when an item has been shipped. \n\nEven though shipping/communication is terrible, the bag is pretty cool and I've been using it daily as my work bag. I only have a few items in my bag, but I normally carry a light jacket, bose qc35 and my mbp. I keep my Bose in my Verge case, which is very convenient but eats up a lot of space.\n\nThe EXM bag is real sturdy and I've carried a few items in there. It's great to store gym clothes. I do BJJ, so when we have our No-Gi classes, I can just stick it in there instead of my big workout backpack. \n",

        "selftext": "*I'm having issues uploading the images for some reason... I reduced the size below 300kb, still \"processing\"...*\n\nHello Onebaggers,\n\nIt has now been a while since I have the Errant but I mainly used it as EDC and gym bag. I own an [Allpa 28 that I used for longer travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/couzgm/25_weeks_in_south_east_asia/) but I wanted to test the Errant for Onebag purposes. Every Errant owner realizes that it holds a \"small\" 24l (the capacity announced by Boundary Supply) but I wanted to see whether I could onebag with it anyway! 3 nights is a short trip but it was a good start to see if it is doable.\n\nThe trickiest part was to find the perfect packing cube for the bag, I have tried the pack it specter from eagle creek, the amazon basics and the gonex compression cubes. But in the end, the best packing cube for the Boundary Errant is the Peak Design small compression cube.\n\n[The cube is a perfect fit: image](https://imgur.com/r3uQ21B)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img i59d270ocks31...*\n\nThis cube surprisingly holds a considerable amount of clothes but if you need more (for a longer period), I find that the Gonex compression cube \"slim\" fits very well at the place where I put my Montbell umbrella. For this trip, I did not need to use the shoe compartment so the packing cube rested at the bottom of the bag, but if you use the compartment, the cube will be a bit higher, which is not an issue at all.\n\n**Complete packing list:**\n\n* On me:\n   * Jeans\n   * Icebreaker merino t-shirt\n   * Sports jacket\n   * Belt\n   * Merino socks\n   * Boxer briefs\n   * Wallet\n   * Phone\n   * Onitsuka tiger comfortable sneakers\n* In the [Peak design small cube](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/packing-cube?variant=11531140038700):\n   * 1 airism uniqlo t-shirt\n   * 1 uniqlo dry t-shirt\n   * 1 uniqlo heattech long-sleeve t-shirt\n   * 1 DC hybrid shorts\n   * 1 uniqlo hoodie\n   * 3 pairs of boxer briefs\n   * 1 pair of merino socks\n* In the inside lateral mesh pockets:\n   * In right one, transparent dopp kit with:\n      * Electric toothbrush\n      * Electric razor\n      * Toothpaste\n      * Deodorant\n   * In the left one:\n      * Montbell umbrella\n      * Vapur bottle when empty\n* In the inside top pocket:\n   * Taotronics ANC headphones\n   * Jack cable\n   * Plane jack adaptor\n* In the front pocket:\n   * Sunglasses\n* In the lateral quick access pocket:\n   * Keys attached to a carabiner (itself attached to a loop)\n   * Lumix TZ100\n   * Pen\n* In the secret passport pocket:\n   * I'll let you guess\n* In the shoe compartment:\n   * Nothing\n* On the laptop side:\n   * Asus 14 inches laptop\n   * Charger\n   * Kindle\n   * Powerbank\n   * USB cable\n   * Power plug\n   * Backup earphones\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The laptop side](https://imgur.com/m5ZXZc0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The bigger picture](https://imgur.com/ea4ZJuc)\n\nI could have easily added stuff in the shoe compartment (my size 44 are a tight squeeze but fit if needs be) such as flip flops or a jacket. I also had a lot of space on the top of the bag by accessing it from the front (top) opening. I did place my sports jacket (quite bulky) there on some occasions and still had leftover space. I was also easily able fit my filled bottle in the bottle holder on the outside of the bag, even when fully packed.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that the bag is actually usable to onebag for longer trips and it has the advantage to be an excellent EDC once you arrive at destination. I could have easily added some soap or laundry product had I wanted to travel for longer. The blazer and hoodie overlap in terms of layer usage but I was not limited by space at all. In terms of weight, with the laptop I reach around 6kg and it is true that the bag is heavy by itself. But the benefits are a great back panel extremely breathable, as well as good protection for the laptop and pockets that provide for an easy organization.\n\nThe moment where the Errant shines the most is actually in the plane: it is super easy to place it under the seat and extremely convenient to access the different compartments. During the return flight, I had one of those window seats with a metallic box below the seat in front of me but I could still easily fit my bag next to it.\n\nBonus: I met a Prima system owner at Istanbul airport who was boarding the same plane. As proper backpack geeks, we obviously took the chance to discuss and compare our bags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[His prima on the left \\(only half full since he also had a checked in luggage\\) and my errant on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/bl599sl88ks31.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=777fc24a22e027b6b89bea80e3dd337af6a4ee22)\n\nDo you have questions on the Errant or the Allpa? Feel free to ask ! I'm also super interested to hear your tips and tricks when travelling below the 25l capacity, I'm still very new to this community but it is extremely motivating and rewarding!",

                "body": "If you check my [previous Allpa packing list](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/couzgm/25_weeks_in_south_east_asia/), you will see that I managed to put (much) more stuff in the bag than in the errant. I would actually say that the Allpa is a small 28L and the Errant is a small 24L. They both offer a lot of inside organization, which I like, but it occupies much more space than a big boxy compartment.\n\nSeeing your list, what concerns me most is your electronics and the photo gear which is tough to find place for, even in the Allpa. If, for example, you were planning to use the camera cube by Boundary supply, you won't have enough space to put anything else in the bag.\n\nA big difference between both bags is the laptop compartment. In the Allpa, it competes with the rest of the bag. this means that if the bag is fully packed, you won't be able to squeeze a laptop in afterwards. The Errant's laptop compartment occupies a definite space making it easy to place the laptop but also guaranteeing that you lose main compartment space, and this even if the laptop compartment is empty.\n\nWith my post, I wanted to see if the Errant is usable for minimal travel. It is, but it has to be very minimal! The Allpa allows for more luxury items (although you **have** to take a day bag with you). If it is the style of the Errant that attracts you, perhaps you could check out the Prima System?\n\nIf you have more questions, feel free!\n\nGoodluck!",
