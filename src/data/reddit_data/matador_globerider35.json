            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes?

            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

I won't be posting a lot of photos since you can see them on their official website, but I will try to post some initial impressions on the bag and compare it to the Aer.\n\nPro\n\n* Bigger AND lighter than the smaller Aer Travel Pack 3 Small X-pac\n* With my typical load it's very comfortable. Not sure if it's the hip belt or simply because it's lighter, maybe both\n* I like the internal organization on the main compartment more than on the Aer\n* I like that the laptop compartment is inside the main compartment and not in its own compartment like the Aer. I think this maximizes carry volume better.\n* There's an opening below the laptop sleeve that you can reach inside to take out the back padding to perhaps make it even lighter.\n* It has an external water bottle pocket\n* Both the shoulder straps and the hip belt can be stowed, and the hip belt can be removed entirely\n* Most external pockets and compartments have their own volume that expands outward somewhat\n\nNeutral\n\n* The shoulder strap is maybe a little wide for my body type, and the padding is very hard and stiff. Maybe a little bit of break-in will help\n* I wish the admin panel is better. Aer has a better and more useable admin panel in my opinion\n* I haven't used a hip belt since maybe 20 years ago and I am not sure I would use it with this bag or not. I've carried a \\~40L Eagle Creek duffle/backpack for travel for many years and that one doesn't have hip belt nor a very good harness system, and it was \"fine.\"\n* The hip belt is quite difficult to remove because of the velcro\n* I wish they kept the grid fabric design from the 45L version, even if not in UHMWPE\n* The front mesh pocket is quite floppy and loose. Maybe I will add some cords to tie it down to keep things from moving or falling out\n\nCon\n\n* Some questionable stitching on the shoulder strap attachment points\n* Fabric isn't as nice as Ultra or X-pac\n* The secret pocket is quite difficult to use, but I guess that's the point. You would probably only put things in there that you won't need very often. The side pocket in the Aer is more useful to me since it's still pretty discrete while still being pretty accessible.\n* It doesn't stand on its own very well; it tends to lean forward even when loaded with a laptop in the back\n* There's a tiny stain on one of the mesh pocket in the main compartment\n\nOverall, I am liking this bag. I just wish the fabric is a little \"fancier\" and the black version isn't so \"understated.\"",

Plus, the whole reason you probably like the inside pockets so much is because that outside pocket is “short” and lets the inside ones have bigger independent volume.  The deep admin pocket on the TP3 means the inner pockets behind it are more squished for space. ",

One, like yours, was through the thick and stuff attachment points of the straps. It seems like the bobbin tension is a tiny bit off, some of the thread from the bottom is pulled tighter to the topside. Other side was in the admin panel. \n\nActually the threads on my Matador gear tags were a tiny bit unfinished too, at this price point I think I want a tiny bit more refinement from the brand. ",

        "selftext": "Got in the new Matador Globerider 35 yesterday in garnet, an awesome colorway. Did some test loading and carrying (about 18 pounds of gear) and the harness felt fantastic, especially with the hip belt engaged. \n\nThings I Love:\n\n-the colorway\n\n-dual access to the main compartment makes this easy to pack smart, and get quick access to whatever you leave on top, along with the laptop\n\n-the harness is fantastic. Wide, thickly padded straps, load lifters, micro-adjustable sternum strap, and a really nice hip belt make this a very comfortable carry. Doubt I’ll really need the hip belt but definitely a nice option to stow it or remove it. \n\n-has just the right amount of organization. The two bottom pocket on the inside of the lid have built in volume to them. Was able to fit my Gravel Mini and Evergoods CAP.5 in one without issue or impeding on the main compartment. \n\n-tons of attachment points, counter pulls, and zipper security loops\n\n-top QAP is felt lined for sunglasses or other scratchable items\n\n-front admin pocket fits a CAP1 plus items in the built in pocketing. This does reduce the effectiveness of the top split pocket inside the lid. \n\n-hidden pocket in back panel is perfect for an AirTag and your passport\n\n-the bottle pocket is great stretch mesh and the loop on it for easy access is a nice addition\n\n\nThings I Wished It Had:\n\n-wish they had kept the grid pattern bottom of the 45\n\n-would have rather a 2nd water bottle pocket over the side handle since there’s already 4 handles on the front\n\n-wish it had compression straps inside to really flatten out my Peak Design cubes but not a big deal",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jlv9jh/matador_globerider_35_black_full_review/",
        "selftext": "I obsessed over which one bag to buy for about a year.  Couple of times I decided “this is it”, but never pulled the trigger. Whichever bag it was at the time was either missing a feature or two on my wishlist, or had stuff I didn’t want, etc.  When the GlobeRider 35 dropped, it had pretty much the perfect magical mix (for me at least).  If anyone is interested in what my wishlist was and which ones i decided against and why, lmk and i can try to post it.\n\n\nSo buckle up fu*kleheads, here’s my review of the Matador GlobeRider35.\n\n\nI might not go over every single feature, especially if it’s well-covered elsewhere, but there’s a few things I tried especially to cover if i haven’t seen it in other reviews.\n\n\nOverall:     35L is the right size for me—i wanted something carry-on that would mostly fly under airline notice.  But I have stuff, and smaller capacity would mean sacrifices I don’t want to make.\n\nMaterials are top notch, I love Matador’s stretch mesh used on the front pocket and inside the admin pocket.  Buckles feel smooth; love the zipper pulls especially the differentiated white ones for the main compartment.  The water resistant material and coated zips mean i don’t have to carry a rain fly or stress if there’s a light shower.  Overall style for the black colorway is subtle but sexy.\n\nWeight without the hip belt is 3lbs; i don’t plan on using it unless i have a trip with a lot of walking around or stairs but it also tucks away nicely if needed (see pics).  Have a couple pieces of cardboard to slip in on either side to keep the Velcro from reengaging as you remove, otherwise it’s near impossible.\n\n\nPockets:     The right amount of pockets.  Fleece-lined pocket on the top means nothing gets smooshed, and it’s perfect for keeping airpods and phone going while going through security.  \n\nI personally don’t like an admin panel that goes all the way to the bottom; I’d rather have that capacity on inside lid pockets.  (See pics) I took a pic of the capacity with a charger inside for scale, the gusset is an ovoid shape that’s wider in the middle and tapers down at the ends.  \n4 pen slots is a waste, i don’t have anything else besides a pen and lip balm that would need it and would have preferred a third larger pocket.  Kinda want to take a seam ripper to one of them and make a third bigger pocket instead. If I did it, should I do it all the way to the left, in between the two pen slots, or closest to the bigger slots?\nKindle and switch fit no problem, could probably fit a switch case but probably not other larger tech.  Steam deck is definitely too big, but you’d be able to fit at the top of the main compartment and easily get to it with the top access zip.  \n\nGreat little smuggler’s pocket on the back for passport and cash (see pic), you’d never know it was there unless already familiar with the bag (wished it was RFID too).  \n\nWater bottle pocket is also stretch mesh and should hold most sizes well.  If the bottle has a handle the compression strap can thread through it.\n\nOutside stuff pocket is made of that same really nice stretch mesh, great spot for a jacket. I have an old Patagonia with a bungee cord, but never liked using it for clothes, felt too bulky.  The only thing I REALLY wish Matador would have done is to add the same zipper that the Refraction packable backpack has on its outside pocket.\n\n\nMain Area:     Organization is just what I wanted personally.  Big clamshell opening, room for packing cubes.  I don’t usually travel with a laptop, so to me a separate tech area is wasted space.  A sleeve on the back with the magnetic closure is perfect for an iPad or if i do need to bring a laptop on a work trip.  Dual access is great, the laptop sleeve is really only accessible from the top OR from the separate laptop zipper (which itself doesn’t give access to the main area).  \n\nTop 2 inside mesh pockets don’t have capacity.  Middle and bottom zip pockets do (see pics), but it’s slightly different volume for each.  The middle zip pocket shares the ovoid gusset with the outside admin pocket, and there’s the same shaped gusset at the bottom.  The lowest zip pocket shares this gusset but at the bottom of the pack the mesh just meets with the lid, no gusset.  So the middle mesh zip pocket has the most room.\n\nI like that there are compression straps that DON’T interfere with getting into the main area.  \n\n\nBack/Harness:  Really comfortable, cushy straps.  Load lifters are a must for me; most packs i like aren’t designed for women, and load lifters help dial in the fit.  Matador take note—don’t make it pink or change any of the features, but offer a version with more S-curved straps.  Anyone with breast tissue would love it.  \n\nNo notes on the sternum strap; allows for micro adjustments and doesn’t seem like it’ll move around much but time will tell.  \n\nFor a $290 price (I paid $260 with a code), why no cord keepers besides the sternum strap?!?  I wish they had them for the harness straps, hip belt, and top compression straps.  I’m going to see what i can rig up with gaffers tape or the ones from Tom Binh, but in this price range i shouldn’t have to.  If you don’t have hips, the mesh pockets on the hip belt will manage that dangle at least.\n\nThe side laptop zipper isn’t easily lockable, which is odd, but a small TSA lock will fit between the metal part and the loop for top compression strap (see pic).  I don’t usually travel with a laptop and the bag will always be carryon only, but why wouldn’t they dedicate a way to secure your most expensive tech?  \n\nOn a similar note, forgot to mention that the top main access zipper has theft protection loops on BOTH ends, so you can secure on whichever side you want. \n\n\nTLDR:  I love this bag—it checks almost every box i had in a very long list, and none of the small nitpicks are even close to dealbreakers.  Can’t wait to take this with me to Mexico in a few months. Happy to answer any questions if there’s anything else you want to know!",
