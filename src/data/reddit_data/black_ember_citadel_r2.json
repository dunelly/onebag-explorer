Hard material makes it hard to see and access items inside unless more open which makes it less practical on the go.\nBetter padding, bottle pocket, no middle divider as it seems useless and just taking up more space, instead padding in the front inner sleeve area.\nSeethrough inner pockets, better quickaccess instead of the back one and retracable straps.\n\nCompared to Aer:\nLess zippers and more practical, much worse comfort, lacks outside quickaccess and bottle pockets\nOne compartment fills up from sides so area in middle is practically unusable even through significant size /would make most of the inner pockets unaccessable unless things in middle were removed\nMore waterproofing and cooler look.\n\n\nAer City Pack Pro - Xpac\n\nPros:\n- Soft padding on cak and straps, however top of the straps is put in place and this more limited movement is more irratating than BE Citatel\n- water bottle pocket\n- quickaccess on side and small padded pocket on top, overall many compartments\n- Water resistant enough \n- Main compartments is basically free after filling up the rest, so practically significantly bigger than BE Citadel R2d\n\nCons:\n- Too many compartments make it bit more hustle to use, fruthermore as lot of them have own zippers which isnt ideal for quick access\n- Main compartment on the outside side makes it feel weird and not stand well (considering main area is usually not filled, when used as EDC)\n- zippers are bit harder to open due to waterproofing which isnt big deal but considering you will use them over many years daily it might be annoying\n\nImprovement ideas:\nSeethrough compartments without zippers, \nsmoother zippers and more room /compartments in the laptop compartment rather than divided across many zippers. More movable straps as it felt good on BE Citadel",

Hard material makes it hard to see and access items inside unless more open which makes it less practical on the go.\nBetter padding, bottle pocket, no middle divider as it seems useless and just taking up more space, instead padding in the front inner sleeve area.\nSeethrough inner pockets, better quickaccess instead of the back one and retracable straps.\n\nCompared to Aer:\nLess zippers and more practical, much worse comfort, lacks outside quickaccess and bottle pockets\nOne compartment fills up from sides so area in middle is practically unusable even through significant size /would make most of the inner pockets unaccessable unless things in middle were removed\nMore waterproofing and cooler look.\n\n\nAer City Pack Pro - Xpac\n\nPros:\n- Soft padding on cak and straps, however top of the straps is put in place and this more limited movement is more irratating than BE Citatel\n- water bottle pocket\n- quickaccess on side and small padded pocket on top, overall many compartments\n- Water resistant enough \n- Main compartments is basically free after filling up the rest, so practically significantly bigger than BE Citadel R2d\n\nCons:\n- Too many compartments make it bit more hustle to use, fruthermore as lot of them have own zippers which isnt ideal for quick access\n- Main compartment on the outside side makes it feel weird and not stand well (considering main area is usually not filled, when used as EDC)\n- zippers are bit harder to open due to waterproofing which isnt big deal but considering you will use them over many years daily it might be annoying\n\nImprovement ideas:\nSeethrough compartments without zippers, \nsmoother zippers and more room /compartments in the laptop compartment rather than divided across many zippers. More movable straps as it felt good on BE Citadel",

Hard material makes it hard to see and access items inside unless more open which makes it less practical on the go.\nBetter padding, bottle pocket, no middle divider as it seems useless and just taking up more space, instead padding in the front inner sleeve area.\nSeethrough inner pockets, better quickaccess instead of the back one and retracable straps.\n\nCompared to Aer:\nLess zippers and more practical, much worse comfort, lacks outside quickaccess and bottle pockets\nOne compartment fills up from sides so area in middle is practically unusable even through significant size /would make most of the inner pockets unaccessable unless things in middle were removed\nMore waterproofing and cooler look.\n\n\nAer City Pack Pro - Xpac\n\nPros:\n- Soft padding on cak and straps, however top of the straps is put in place and this more limited movement is more irratating than BE Citatel\n- water bottle pocket\n- quickaccess on side and small padded pocket on top, overall many compartments\n- Water resistant enough \n- Main compartments is basically free after filling up the rest, so practically significantly bigger than BE Citadel R2d\n\nCons:\n- Too many compartments make it bit more hustle to use, fruthermore as lot of them have own zippers which isnt ideal for quick access\n- Main compartment on the outside side makes it feel weird and not stand well (considering main area is usually not filled, when used as EDC)\n- zippers are bit harder to open due to waterproofing which isnt big deal but considering you will use them over many years daily it might be annoying\n\nImprovement ideas:\nSeethrough compartments without zippers, \nsmoother zippers and more room /compartments in the laptop compartment rather than divided across many zippers.

Hard material makes it hard to see and access items inside unless more open which makes it less practical on the go.\nBetter padding, bottle pocket, no middle divider as it seems useless and just taking up more space, instead padding in the front inner sleeve area.\nSeethrough inner pockets, better quickaccess instead of the back one and retracable straps.\n\nCompared to Aer:\nLess zippers and more practical, much worse comfort, lacks outside quickaccess and bottle pockets\nOne compartment fills up from sides so area in middle is practically unusable even through significant size /would make most of the inner pockets unaccessable unless things in middle were removed\nMore waterproofing and cooler look.\n\n\nAer City Pack Pro - Xpac\n\nPros:\n- Soft padding on cak and straps, however top of the straps is put in place and this more limited movement is more irratating than BE Citatel\n- water bottle pocket\n- quickaccess on side and small padded pocket on top, overall many compartments\n- Water resistant enough \n- Main compartments is basically free after filling up the rest, so practically significantly bigger than BE Citadel R2d\n\nCons:\n- Too many compartments make it bit more hustle to use, fruthermore as lot of them have own zippers which isnt ideal for quick access\n- Main compartment on the outside side makes it feel weird and not stand well (considering main area is usually not filled, when used as EDC)\n- zippers are bit harder to open due to waterproofing which isnt big deal but considering you will use them over many years daily it might be annoying\n\nImprovement ideas:\nSeethrough compartments without zippers, \nsmoother zippers and more room /compartments in the laptop compartment rather than divided across many zippers. More movable straps as it felt good on BE Citadel",

Hard material makes it hard to see and access items inside unless more open which makes it less practical on the go.\nBetter padding, bottle pocket, no middle divider as it seems useless and just taking up more space, instead padding in the front inner sleeve area.\nSeethrough inner pockets, better quickaccess instead of the back one and retracable straps.\n\nCompared to Aer:\nLess zippers and more practical, much worse comfort, lacks outside quickaccess and bottle pockets\nOne compartment fills up from sides so area in middle is practically unusable even through significant size /would make most of the inner pockets unaccessable unless things in middle were removed\nMore waterproofing and cooler look.\n\n\nAer City Pack Pro - Xpac\n\nPros:\n- Soft padding on cak and straps, however top of the straps is put in place and this more limited movement is more irratating than BE Citatel\n- water bottle pocket\n- quickaccess on side and small padded pocket on top, overall many compartments\n- Water resistant enough \n- Main compartments is basically free after filling up the rest, so practically significantly bigger than BE Citadel R2d\n\nCons:\n- Too many compartments make it bit more hustle to use, fruthermore as lot of them have own zippers which isnt ideal for quick access\n- Main compartment on the outside side makes it feel weird and not stand well (considering main area is usually not filled, when used as EDC)\n- zippers are bit harder to open due to waterproofing which isnt big deal but considering you will use them over many years daily it might be annoying\n\nImprovement ideas:\nSeethrough compartments without zippers, \nsmoother zippers and more room /compartments in the laptop compartment rather than divided across many zippers. More movable straps as it felt good on BE Citadel",

        "selftext": "First thing I noticed is that this backpack is hefty, I can tell by just holding the box. That’s coming from someone who uses Aer bags which are on the heavier side for most. I would care if it’s a larger bag but since this only 20L and edc I don’t mind the weight. It’s noticeable while empty so if you’re not a huge fan of heavy packs then I’d recommend you go see it in person or try it before you commit to it. This is largely due to the thicccccc back panel and laptop compartment. Non issue for me but maybe for some. \n\nBefore I get into the some of the features, let’s address the elephant in the room. This back pack is damn sexy. Seriously, picture doesn’t do any justice. Jet black is the perfect description of this color, some angles it looks stealthy and when the light hits at the right angle there’s this shine to it that just scream sexy. They should’ve named this after the SR-71 blackbird.\n\nThey nailed it with the profile and design of this pack, not too boxy and not too slim and just right for a 20L. I would say it’s a very modern looking bag but also classic at the same time. Very professional looking and I wouldn’t hesitate taking this to a client meeting or business setting. \n\nNot going through all the pockets and feature as you can find tons of reviews on YouTube for the 18L. This one is just a bit larger. I don’t own the 18L so I can’t compare but I can tell you some points in the below.\n\nBack panel is nice and thick, over engineered for this size of back pack imo. They could probably shave a few millimeters on materials to save weight and cost. Ventilation is similar to my Aer CCP, and probably even better due to a bigger channel and large perforated foam on the panels. \n\nStrap is nice and beef similar to Aer’s. I can’t comment on long term comfort but initial try on is very comfy, I’m about 5’6” 170lbs so it may fit my frame better vs someone who’s larger. Sternum strap is nice, I wasn’t sure I like the loop adjustment but it’s very slim profile and solid so I’m happy. I really really like the strap management, the way it’s sewn to into the adjustable loop keeps the strap nice neat and neat. On the Aer would occasional fall out the the loop which can get annoying.\n\nYKK zippers are nice and smooth and actually liked them more than my Aer one, the Aer zippers on the CPP is beefier but it doesn’t glide as nice.\n\nReally like the stealth pocket(s) on the inside like my Aer which is use for storing my wallet and passport when I’m traveling. I wish it has a AirTag spot though but not a big deal breaker.\n\nLaptop compartment - I could fit my work 14” laptop fine, it’s a bit snug but it works. Laptop is the HP elite book G8 850 if you wanna go look up dimensions for reference. I can actually squeeze in my 12.9 iPad Pro in the same slot but it’s very tight. Only did it just to push the limit. Figured this is what you guys are curious about most.\n\nOn to the load out here’s what I packed to test:\n- 14” laptop\n- 12.9” iPad Pro w/ keyboard caes\n- Steamdeck\n- Peak Design tech pouch\n- Nikon Zf \n\nI could’ve thrown in a small water bottle, another lens and a packable jacket as well. There’s still some room in the front pocket and top pocket. \n\nNormally I wouldn’t carry both my work laptop and/or steam deck for specific occasions. \n\nBack pack can “stand” by itself once it’s fully loaded but it’s a bit harder when it’s empty.\n\nThe peak design tech puch is overkill, I am in the process of getting a smaller one. \n\nI started getting back into photography so the camera is going to be my edc from now on and it’s part of a reason why I’m in the market for this bag. Yes, no cushion but I don’t baby my camera.\n\nI started to load the bag clamshell but I prefer to top load for the edc I carry. Having the option to open clamshell is a huge bonus whenever I pack to travel.\n\nIt does feel smaller than other 20L for sure mainly due to the padding but I expected that from all the reviews.\n\nOne thing I really wished they add was the modular side handle option at least. No need to include the handle but at least the mount point. \n\nNo cons from me so far personally, I bought this bag after watching tons of the 18L review so I knew what I am walking into. Everything is as expected and so far I love it. \n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions, didn’t realize this firs impression got so wordy haha.",

I will say the weight distribution is nice since most of the weight is the back panel and the pack is slimmer. Most of the weight is against my back so it's very comfy and stable. On the CPP it can feel a bit unstable if the pack has lot of room and things shift away from your back (CPP is also oddly top heavy as well).\n\nI wore it for at least 3 of the 4 hrs out and it felt good and that's also longer than the average carry for me.",

        "selftext": "First thing I noticed is that this backpack is hefty, I can tell by just holding the box. That’s coming from someone who uses Aer bags which are on the heavier side for most. I would care if it’s a larger bag but since this only 20L and edc I don’t mind the weight. It’s noticeable while empty so if you’re not a huge fan of heavy packs then I’d recommend you go see it in person or try it before you commit to it. This is largely due to the thicccccc back panel and laptop compartment. Non issue for me but maybe for some. \n\nBefore I get into the some of the features, let’s address the elephant in the room. This back pack is damn sexy. Seriously, picture doesn’t do any justice. Jet black is the perfect description of this color, some angles it looks stealthy and when the light hits at the right angle there’s this shine to it that just scream sexy. They should’ve named this after the SR-71 blackbird.\n\nThey nailed it with the profile and design of this pack, not too boxy and not too slim and just right for a 20L. I would say it’s a very modern looking bag but also classic at the same time. Very professional looking and I wouldn’t hesitate taking this to a client meeting or business setting. \n\nNot going through all the pockets and feature as you can find tons of reviews on YouTube for the 18L. This one is just a bit larger. I don’t own the 18L so I can’t compare but I can tell you some points in the below.\n\nBack panel is nice and thick, over engineered for this size of back pack imo. They could probably shave a few millimeters on materials to save weight and cost. Ventilation is similar to my Aer CCP, and probably even better due to a bigger channel and large perforated foam on the panels. \n\nStrap is nice and beef similar to Aer’s. I can’t comment on long term comfort but initial try on is very comfy, I’m about 5’6” 170lbs so it may fit my frame better vs someone who’s larger. Sternum strap is nice, I wasn’t sure I like the loop adjustment but it’s very slim profile and solid so I’m happy. I really really like the strap management, the way it’s sewn to into the adjustable loop keeps the strap nice neat and neat. On the Aer would occasional fall out the the loop which can get annoying.\n\nYKK zippers are nice and smooth and actually liked them more than my Aer one, the Aer zippers on the CPP is beefier but it doesn’t glide as nice.\n\nReally like the stealth pocket(s) on the inside like my Aer which is use for storing my wallet and passport when I’m traveling. I wish it has a AirTag spot though but not a big deal breaker.\n\nLaptop compartment - I could fit my work 14” laptop fine, it’s a bit snug but it works. Laptop is the HP elite book G8 850 if you wanna go look up dimensions for reference. I can actually squeeze in my 12.9 iPad Pro in the same slot but it’s very tight. Only did it just to push the limit. Figured this is what you guys are curious about most.\n\nOn to the load out here’s what I packed to test:\n- 14” laptop\n- 12.9” iPad Pro w/ keyboard caes\n- Steamdeck\n- Peak Design tech pouch\n- Nikon Zf \n\nI could’ve thrown in a small water bottle, another lens and a packable jacket as well.

I will say the weight distribution is nice since most of the weight is the back panel and the pack is slimmer. Most of the weight is against my back so it's very comfy and stable. On the CPP it can feel a bit unstable if the pack has lot of room and things shift away from your back (CPP is also oddly top heavy as well).\n\nI wore it for at least 3 of the 4 hrs out and it felt good and that's also longer than the average carry for me.",

        "selftext": "First thing I noticed is that this backpack is hefty, I can tell by just holding the box. That’s coming from someone who uses Aer bags which are on the heavier side for most. I would care if it’s a larger bag but since this only 20L and edc I don’t mind the weight. It’s noticeable while empty so if you’re not a huge fan of heavy packs then I’d recommend you go see it in person or try it before you commit to it. This is largely due to the thicccccc back panel and laptop compartment. Non issue for me but maybe for some. \n\nBefore I get into the some of the features, let’s address the elephant in the room. This back pack is damn sexy. Seriously, picture doesn’t do any justice. Jet black is the perfect description of this color, some angles it looks stealthy and when the light hits at the right angle there’s this shine to it that just scream sexy. They should’ve named this after the SR-71 blackbird.\n\nThey nailed it with the profile and design of this pack, not too boxy and not too slim and just right for a 20L. I would say it’s a very modern looking bag but also classic at the same time. Very professional looking and I wouldn’t hesitate taking this to a client meeting or business setting. \n\nNot going through all the pockets and feature as you can find tons of reviews on YouTube for the 18L. This one is just a bit larger. I don’t own the 18L so I can’t compare but I can tell you some points in the below.\n\nBack panel is nice and thick, over engineered for this size of back pack imo. They could probably shave a few millimeters on materials to save weight and cost. Ventilation is similar to my Aer CCP, and probably even better due to a bigger channel and large perforated foam on the panels. \n\nStrap is nice and beef similar to Aer’s. I can’t comment on long term comfort but initial try on is very comfy, I’m about 5’6” 170lbs so it may fit my frame better vs someone who’s larger. Sternum strap is nice, I wasn’t sure I like the loop adjustment but it’s very slim profile and solid so I’m happy. I really really like the strap management, the way it’s sewn to into the adjustable loop keeps the strap nice neat and neat. On the Aer would occasional fall out the the loop which can get annoying.\n\nYKK zippers are nice and smooth and actually liked them more than my Aer one, the Aer zippers on the CPP is beefier but it doesn’t glide as nice.\n\nReally like the stealth pocket(s) on the inside like my Aer which is use for storing my wallet and passport when I’m traveling. I wish it has a AirTag spot though but not a big deal breaker.\n\nLaptop compartment - I could fit my work 14” laptop fine, it’s a bit snug but it works. Laptop is the HP elite book G8 850 if you wanna go look up dimensions for reference. I can actually squeeze in my 12.9 iPad Pro in the same slot but it’s very tight. Only did it just to push the limit. Figured this is what you guys are curious about most.\n\nOn to the load out here’s what I packed to test:\n- 14” laptop\n- 12.9” iPad Pro w/ keyboard caes\n- Steamdeck\n- Peak Design tech pouch\n- Nikon Zf \n\nI could’ve thrown in a small water bottle, another lens and a packable jacket as well. There’s still some room in the front pocket and top pocket. \n\nNormally I wouldn’t carry both my work laptop and/or steam deck for specific occasions. \n\nBack pack can “stand” by itself once it’s fully loaded but it’s a bit harder when it’s empty.\n\nThe peak design tech puch is overkill, I am in the process of getting a smaller one. \n\nI started getting back into photography so the camera is going to be my edc from now on and it’s part of a reason why I’m in the market for this bag. Yes, no cushion but I don’t baby my camera.\n\nI started to load the bag clamshell but I prefer to top load for the edc I carry. Having the option to open clamshell is a huge bonus whenever I pack to travel.\n\nIt does feel smaller than other 20L for sure mainly due to the padding but I expected that from all the reviews.\n\nOne thing I really wished they add was the modular side handle option at least.

I will say the weight distribution is nice since most of the weight is the back panel and the pack is slimmer. Most of the weight is against my back so it's very comfy and stable. On the CPP it can feel a bit unstable if the pack has lot of room and things shift away from your back (CPP is also oddly top heavy as well).\n\nI wore it for at least 3 of the 4 hrs out and it felt good and that's also longer than the average carry for me.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1gcyott/black_ember_citadel_20l_first_impression/?tl=fr",
        "selftext": "First thing I noticed is that this backpack is hefty, I can tell by just holding the box. That’s coming from someone who uses Aer bags which are on the heavier side for most. I would care if it’s a larger bag but since this only 20L and edc I don’t mind the weight. It’s noticeable while empty so if you’re not a huge fan of heavy packs then I’d recommend you go see it in person or try it before you commit to it. This is largely due to the thicccccc back panel and laptop compartment. Non issue for me but maybe for some. \n\nBefore I get into the some of the features, let’s address the elephant in the room. This back pack is damn sexy. Seriously, picture doesn’t do any justice. Jet black is the perfect description of this color, some angles it looks stealthy and when the light hits at the right angle there’s this shine to it that just scream sexy. They should’ve named this after the SR-71 blackbird.\n\nThey nailed it with the profile and design of this pack, not too boxy and not too slim and just right for a 20L. I would say it’s a very modern looking bag but also classic at the same time. Very professional looking and I wouldn’t hesitate taking this to a client meeting or business setting. \n\nNot going through all the pockets and feature as you can find tons of reviews on YouTube for the 18L. This one is just a bit larger. I don’t own the 18L so I can’t compare but I can tell you some points in the below.\n\nBack panel is nice and thick, over engineered for this size of back pack imo. They could probably shave a few millimeters on materials to save weight and cost. Ventilation is similar to my Aer CCP, and probably even better due to a bigger channel and large perforated foam on the panels. \n\nStrap is nice and beef similar to Aer’s. I can’t comment on long term comfort but initial try on is very comfy, I’m about 5’6” 170lbs so it may fit my frame better vs someone who’s larger. Sternum strap is nice, I wasn’t sure I like the loop adjustment but it’s very slim profile and solid so I’m happy. I really really like the strap management, the way it’s sewn to into the adjustable loop keeps the strap nice neat and neat. On the Aer would occasional fall out the the loop which can get annoying.\n\nYKK zippers are nice and smooth and actually liked them more than my Aer one, the Aer zippers on the CPP is beefier but it doesn’t glide as nice.\n\nReally like the stealth pocket(s) on the inside like my Aer which is use for storing my wallet and passport when I’m traveling. I wish it has a AirTag spot though but not a big deal breaker.\n\nLaptop compartment - I could fit my work 14” laptop fine, it’s a bit snug but it works. Laptop is the HP elite book G8 850 if you wanna go look up dimensions for reference. I can actually squeeze in my 12.9 iPad Pro in the same slot but it’s very tight. Only did it just to push the limit. Figured this is what you guys are curious about most.\n\nOn to the load out here’s what I packed to test:\n- 14” laptop\n- 12.9” iPad Pro w/ keyboard caes\n- Steamdeck\n- Peak Design tech pouch\n- Nikon Zf \n\nI could’ve thrown in a small water bottle, another lens and a packable jacket as well. There’s still some room in the front pocket and top pocket. \n\nNormally I wouldn’t carry both my work laptop and/or steam deck for specific occasions. \n\nBack pack can “stand” by itself once it’s fully loaded but it’s a bit harder when it’s empty.\n\nThe peak design tech puch is overkill, I am in the process of getting a smaller one. \n\nI started getting back into photography so the camera is going to be my edc from now on and it’s part of a reason why I’m in the market for this bag. Yes, no cushion but I don’t baby my camera.\n\nI started to load the bag clamshell but I prefer to top load for the edc I carry. Having the option to open clamshell is a huge bonus whenever I pack to travel.\n\nIt does feel smaller than other 20L for sure mainly due to the padding but I expected that from all the reviews.\n\nOne thing I really wished they add was the modular side handle option at least. No need to include the handle but at least the mount point. \n\nNo cons from me so far personally, I bought this bag after watching tons of the 18L review so I knew what I am walking into. Everything is as expected and so far I love it. \n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions, didn’t realize this firs impression got so wordy haha.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/18rodep/black_ember_citadel_r3_25_liter/",
        "selftext": "I purchased the 25 liter version of this bag in the ‘Max’ package which provides the additional handle and a set of compression straps for the bottom of the bag. I’ve also purchased a set of the black straps and am still on the fence for which I’ll use (I’m leaning towards using the Ember Orange color, but let me know what you think).\n\nOutside of the bag:\nThe color is called Slate Blue and it exhibits shades of blue, grey, slate and also shows bits of purple. It’s a subtle color and visually appealing.\n\nThe fabric is quite unique to me. Cordura’s 420D Velocity fabric is made up of recycled materials but still has this real fabric feel. It has a very tight weave, is very smooth and feels very robust, while at the same time feeling very pliable.  \n\nThe handles are very plush and soft, and it leads me to believe that these will be nice to use.  I’ve got the second handle on the left side of the bag, the same side EVERGOODS has their carry handle installed on (non-mirror).\n\nThe zipper pulls are slick and tougher to grab hold of. Even though they offer the enhanced security feature of securing them through the hypalon pull tab at the end of the zipper track, I’m not sure that outweighs the overall experience. It’s a similar experience to that of the leather pulls that came on the Griffin collab — almost too slick. These are better than the Griffin pulls, as there is a texture to the pull allowing for a bit of grip.  I’ll leave these on for now, but may be looking to change these before too long. \n\nThe straps felt a little thin as I took it out of the bag, but this concern was put to rest once I had the bag on my back with a full loadout inside. This pack is very comfortable to wear. I tend to keep bags pretty high and tight most the time. The back panel is a fairly dense foam but has a nice thin, soft mesh covering both sides. The foam also has perforations  and airflow holes, which help with breathability. The luggage passthrough is tightly sewn on and doesn’t have any sag. This will feel very secure when paired with rolling luggage. The Fidlock sternum strap is my least favorite style. You have to push in on the front, towards your chest to release it the magnet. As I’ve used the bag, it has grown on me but they are replaceable so I’ll continue to see how it is in use for a while before making any changes. Bonus points for being removable. \n\nThe straps are secured by integrated keepers on the webbing. This is awesome, and I wish this was a standard for all bags. Black Ember has the keeper looped around the wedding on the strap and I’ve found that when the pack is on my bag and tightened that the keepers bottom-out on the webbing.  This causes a bit of slack to appear. I’m 6’0, so your mileage will vary as torso heights are taller or shorter. To fix this, I rolled the strap and keeper upwards to remove the extra slack to my desired preference. I attached an image of the before and after.\n\nIt does not stand on its own without being packed out.  Even then, it wants to fall forward a bit. That’s never been an issue with bags for me, but it is nice when a bag does stand on its own and I know some folks here expect this as part of the price of admission with their bags. \n\nLastly, the compression straps. Not sure how I feel about these. When they are not securing anything to the bag, they do not remain tight, and begin to droop.  You can even see the slack in some of the images.  That’s definitely something that will bother me, as I’d want them to stay tight around the bottom of the bag.  I can see use cases where I’d have something down there but I’m thinking these might be better off unattached and at-the-ready somewhere inside the bag. \n\nInside of the bag:\nThe lower front pocket is deceptively large. It will easily swallow a smaller jacket or layer. It also fits my moleskin notebook and 5th generation iPad (9.7”) to give you an idea of depth below the zipper line.   I’m only keeping a few small pouches in there right now. \n\nI’m using the top front pocket as my QAP. It’s separated into two slots and also has the Black Ember magnetic key leash tethered to the top of that pocket.  In there I keep my work badge, snacks, my ArcCo Boulder organizer (with my torch and blade), Heroclip, chapstick and pen. \n\nInside the primary compartment of the bag, there is a sleeve against the back panel. The front panel has quite a bit of organization, including a slot for a tablet with a magnetic closure, a zippered slot that also fits my XL sized moleskin notebook, another slot that is always exposed where I am keeping my moleskin notebook and then there is another zippered pocket closer to the front of the bag that extends down the entire front panel.  It’s pretty incredible how much storage and also organization this bag offers. Some may find the options overwhelming but it’s great for me as I can easily throw smaller pouches into these more dedicated spots.\n\nThere is not much to say about the dedicated laptop compartment. The bag lacks any fleece lining or anything soft, but it is very padded and suspended — ensuring that your machine will be transported securely. \n\nAs a fan of Black Ember, and have owned their products previously, I am happy to say that this bag is an upgrade in both my experience using the bag as well as with the materials they’ve chosen. This is a great bag for EDC, and for folks that don’t require a dedicated laptop sleeve and have a slightly smaller carry, the 18 liter variant would be a good option. The only thing to reiterate would be that this bag does not stand well on its own, and will not unless packed. It’s also a bag that offer ample organization so if this isn’t your style, you may want to consider a bag with a more cavernous primary compartment. \n\nPictures: https://imgur.com/a/jMVREdd",

One thing I didn't mention in my own review of the orange one is that the laptop compartment is GIGANTIC. You could probably fit an 18\" laptop in there, or more. My 16\" one doesn't jostle around, but what the big size means is that i can also throw a slim pouch or two in that compartment on top of the laptop. For example, my Boundary Supply Rennen Pouch fits in there just fine even with the laptop in it as well. It's almost like a second quick-access pocket--too much good space to be wasted.",

Not sure how reliable/sturdy it would be in the long run, but I can definitely see it acting as a nice quick release spot to attach things like hats or hanging light jackets. And it stays nice and flat when tightened, so it still maintains the sleek silhouette. There aren’t a lot of places to add external attachments to the citadel (which I actually don’t mind), so thought this could be useful for some people!",

            "body": "Going off of this list, based on my own personal style/daily needs, I like the following:\n\n* [Black Ember Citadel Minimal Backpack](http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Black-Ember-Citadel-Minimal-Backpack.jpg)\n* [ARKTYPE Dashpack](http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ARKTYPE-Dashpack.jpg)\n* [Vertx EDC Gamut](http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Vertx-EDC-Gamut-1.jpg)\n* [Pelican MPB25 Mobile Protect Backpack](http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Pelican-MPB25-Mobile-Protect-Backpack.jpg)\n* [Brown Buffalo Conceal Backpack](http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Brown-Buffalo-Conceal-Backpack-2.jpg) (comments on this bag at the end)\n\nNothing wrong with the other bags, and I think some of them look good, but they just don't fit with my lifestyle/personality.\n\n**Functionality:**\n\nI think the Black Ember Citadel and the Vertex EDC Gamut tie here for best functionality, and it would be mostly preference.  Both have a nice clamshell opening option which I've come to appreciate in backpacks.  However, the Black Ember has the option to be used as a briefcase and has seemingly cleaner organization, while the Gamut seems really versatile and easier to use for quick access to things.\n\nI would definitely be able to live with the ARKTYPE Dashpack, but I would need to have the mindset that I would only be using it for daily essentials and not as something I would be using for extended periods of time.  Maybe just for class or work, knowing I wouldn't be doing anything else that day.\n\nPelican doesn't seem too appealing to me in this aspect.  I would rather just pick the ARKTYPE for this scenario.\n\n**Style:**\n\nARKTYPE is the clear winner for me here.  It's slim and stealthy.  Nice minimal branding.  Love the flat look of the bag with the flap hiding the zipper.  Definitely something I wouldn't mind using every day.\n\nNext preference would be the Gamut.  I think it's got a decent look and a nice color to it.  Arguably even stealthier than the ARKTYPE, so if you really dig black, this one would be a solid choice.  The only gripe I have with this bag is that it is a bit large, with its dimensions being 22”H x 14”W x 7”D, but I wouldn't mind using it for a weekend trip.\n\nI like how the Citadel looks, but I just don't like bags that look like boxes.  Otherwise, it's got a nice sleek appearance, and the bottom looks good too.  I think if I ever needed a really professional looking bag that I would carry around as a briefcase 90% of the time, this would be my choice.  However, since that is not that case for me, I would pass on this one in terms of style.\n\nI would like the Pelican for the same reasons as the ARKTYPE if it weren't for that damn logo.  I just don't like it.  It's sideways and it pops out in a bad way to me, not matter which color the bag is.  Overall though, even without the logo, the design pattern doesn't look too attractive to me either.\n\n**Size and shape:**\n\nPelican wins out here.  25 L is enough capacity for me to feel comfortable, and the shape is nice.  Just wish it was as functional and nicer looking.\n\nSecond place would probably be a tie between the ARKTYPE and the Gamut.  I would only use these bags if I knew what I needed them for.  For the ARKTYPE, 15 L is not enough space for me unless I knew I was only going to use it for class/work.  For the Gamut, 28 L is nice, but with the cost of the bag being pretty large, I would only not mind if I were using it for a weekend trip.\n\nIt's rough to put the Citadel in last place here, but I really don't like the box shape.  It also juts out at 6.5 inches, making it even more apparent.  The 25 L capacity is nice to me though, but it's overshadowed by its shape.\n\n**Overall:**\n\n1st:\n\n* Vertex EDC Gamut:  Has enough space to satisfy everything I need, with lots of organization in it plus a clamshell opening.  Looks good, albeit a bit large, but its stealthiness makes up for it to me.\n\n2nd:\n\n* Brown Buffalo Conceal Backpack: See below.\n\n3rd:\n\n* ARKTYPE Dashpack:  Despite its size, it's a good looking bag to me.  If I had the money, I would buy this bag and the Gamut just so I could use this one for class/work and use the Gamut for everything else.  It's functional enough for what it's supposed to do.\n\n4th:\n\n* Black Ember Citadel Minimal Backpack: Love the organization this bag offers plus the clamshell opening.  Love the capacity, but I just don't think it looks that great as a box.  However, I can see the use case for this in a more professional setting.\n\n5th:\n\n* Pelican MPB25 Mobile Protect Backpack: Just don't like the look of this bag or the minimal functionality.  It's got a nice size/shape, but the style of it just makes it a hard no for me.  I'd rather have something that looks stealthier.\n\nThese are just the thoughts I have on these four bags, so if you have similar taste, it might help you pick one out :) I can't comment on things like material quality or what it's like to use them on a daily basis, but these are just the impressions I got from them by looking at their specs, etc.\n\nEDIT:\n\nNo clue why I didn't notice the [Brown Buffalo Conceal Backpack](http://www.carryology.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Brown-Buffalo-Conceal-Backpack-2.jpg).  This bag is awesome! 19 L, a little on the small size, but definitely better than the 15 L ARKTYPE.  Good look and good functionality.  I will admit that I still like the look of the ARKTYPE more though, but it's another option if you need that extra space, which I definitely do.  I would probably place this as #2 because it still looks nice while giving that extra bit of space/functionality compared to the ARKTYPE.",

I do not think they are anywhere near the calibre of many of the bags on this list, and it strikes me as highly impartial. \n\nThat being said, I voted for the morph pack (which I own!). I really enjoy the style, it has all the functionality of a roll top without the roll top ugliness.  It's super lightweight and flat when empty (so you can still carry it around in style) but can get big for grocery runs on the way home. It's flaw is that its not good at carrying more than 10lbs for long periods of time because the straps aren't padded.\n\nI think the Brown Buffalo bag is the clear winner for those who want a goruck .... this is a better looking version of it with more organization and seems to be more thoughtfully made. And I love my goruck. ",
