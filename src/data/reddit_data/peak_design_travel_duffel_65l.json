        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

            "body": "Before I start my rant, I wanna say that I'm a fanboy of peak design. I own several PD products, I love the company philosophy and design DNA and wanted to like this bag a lot. But, two things are making me think about returning this bag or already thinking of ways to modify it. I was planning to put my Camera Cube M and Sling 6L inside, and both fit in perfectly with room to spare and also put the travel duffel on top of my Rimowa Salsa Cabin luggage. I like to research a lot and go thru as many reviews as I can before buying stuff, but I don‚Äôt remember any other reviewer discussing the cons that I would like to talk about. (The pros are plenty and what the reviews say they are.)\n\nFirst of all, the handles are *atrocious*, I saw a bunch of reviews talking about how the magnets in the top handles are not strong enough, but they say it's a small gripe weighing against the pros of the bag. Never mind the magnets, I‚Äôm not talking about the magnets, the handles themselves are the most uncomfortable handles that I've ever used in my whole life, the rigidness makes it so uncomfortable and as soon as I pick it up I can feel like the handles are trying to pull apart from my hand. I hate picking this thing up already. The handles lay flat in your hand parallel to the floor, which makes it feel like you are holding two rulers in your hand rather than a handle. I understand they probably chose this design so that the consumer can double this bag as a backpack, but I just cannot understand how PD design team could pick this bag up and say this is acceptable. It‚Äôs a duffel bag and in my opinion, this should have been maybe the second thing they should have priority on perfecting this bag. They could have just used cheap canvas straps and it would probably be more comfortable than the current ones. My opinion is they just tried to kill two birds with one stone and it came out mediocre at best on both ends.\n\nMy second gripe is I was planning to use this bag as my primary bag for travel with my Rimowa Salsa Cabin, and wish they would have provided one more handle next to the main zipper so I can use it properly as pass-through on the handle to slide on my luggage. PD lists this on their website \"Hand straps double as luggage pass-through for roller bag carry\" I hope that they meant the handles on the bottom of the bag and not the main handles on the top of the bag, because if you use the main handles they are too way loose and just droop to the front if you are not extra careful making the luggage to tip over. The ones on the bottom have two small a loop in my case if that was what they were trying to say. Mine fits in barely, I have to wriggle it in really hard, and taking it out is even more ridiculous, it's like I'm a 34-size waist trying to fit into 31-size skinny jeans, I'm already having nightmares about trying to check in my luggage at the counter and just sweating all over trying to get my duffel bag off the damn luggage handle. I tried using my Sling 6L and that thing passes through perfectly fine. So, why didn't they make the handle loop the same distance as the Sling 6L? Or perhaps they did make it the same clearance, but because of placement and size of the bag the Sling 6L fits okay and the Travel Duffel 35L is struggling. If it is the same clearance, I hope PD makes the bottom loop clearances to be slightly bigger on the duffel in the future. What I would have liked also is that they had another strap on top of the bag next to the main zipper, which makes it possible to sit on top of the luggage sideways as well or maybe on the sides, or the bottom. I understand that they wanted the bag to be flush when on a flat surface so, maybe a strap on the bottom is not an option.\n\nI hope I don‚Äôt come off as abrasive in my critique, I‚Äôm not sure if this forum is moderated by PD or by normal Redditors, but I want to tell you guys I love PD products and hold them highly as a company. I wanted to love this bag to bits and pieces and be good. I expect nothing less from PD. I hope PD hits a home run outta the park with the next version, or provide alternative/upgraded top handles that are way more ergonomic.",

            "body": "Before I start my rant, I wanna say that I'm a fanboy of peak design. I own several PD products, I love the company philosophy and design DNA and wanted to like this bag a lot. But, two things are making me think about returning this bag or already thinking of ways to modify it. I was planning to put my Camera Cube M and Sling 6L inside, and both fit in perfectly with room to spare and also put the travel duffel on top of my Rimowa Salsa Cabin luggage. I like to research a lot and go thru as many reviews as I can before buying stuff, but I don‚Äôt remember any other reviewer discussing the cons that I would like to talk about. (The pros are plenty and what the reviews say they are.)\n\nFirst of all, the handles are *atrocious*, I saw a bunch of reviews talking about how the magnets in the top handles are not strong enough, but they say it's a small gripe weighing against the pros of the bag. Never mind the magnets, I‚Äôm not talking about the magnets, the handles themselves are the most uncomfortable handles that I've ever used in my whole life, the rigidness makes it so uncomfortable and as soon as I pick it up I can feel like the handles are trying to pull apart from my hand. I hate picking this thing up already. The handles lay flat in your hand parallel to the floor, which makes it feel like you are holding two rulers in your hand rather than a handle. I understand they probably chose this design so that the consumer can double this bag as a backpack, but I just cannot understand how PD design team could pick this bag up and say this is acceptable. It‚Äôs a duffel bag and in my opinion, this should have been maybe the second thing they should have priority on perfecting this bag. They could have just used cheap canvas straps and it would probably be more comfortable than the current ones. My opinion is they just tried to kill two birds with one stone and it came out mediocre at best on both ends.\n\nMy second gripe is I was planning to use this bag as my primary bag for travel with my Rimowa Salsa Cabin, and wish they would have provided one more handle next to the main zipper so I can use it properly as pass-through on the handle to slide on my luggage. PD lists this on their website \"Hand straps double as luggage pass-through for roller bag carry\" I hope that they meant the handles on the bottom of the bag and not the main handles on the top of the bag, because if you use the main handles they are too way loose and just droop to the front if you are not extra careful making the luggage to tip over. The ones on the bottom have two small a loop in my case if that was what they were trying to say. Mine fits in barely, I have to wriggle it in really hard, and taking it out is even more ridiculous, it's like I'm a 34-size waist trying to fit into 31-size skinny jeans, I'm already having nightmares about trying to check in my luggage at the counter and just sweating all over trying to get my duffel bag off the damn luggage handle. I tried using my Sling 6L and that thing passes through perfectly fine. So, why didn't they make the handle loop the same distance as the Sling 6L? Or perhaps they did make it the same clearance, but because of placement and size of the bag the Sling 6L fits okay and the Travel Duffel 35L is struggling. If it is the same clearance, I hope PD makes the bottom loop clearances to be slightly bigger on the duffel in the future. What I would have liked also is that they had another strap on top of the bag next to the main zipper, which makes it possible to sit on top of the luggage sideways as well or maybe on the sides, or the bottom. I understand that they wanted the bag to be flush when on a flat surface so, maybe a strap on the bottom is not an option.\n\nI hope I don‚Äôt come off as abrasive in my critique, I‚Äôm not sure if this forum is moderated by PD or by normal Redditors, but I want to tell you guys I love PD products and hold them highly as a company. I wanted to love this bag to bits and pieces and be good. I expect nothing less from PD. I hope PD hits a home run outta the park with the next version, or provide alternative/upgraded top handles that are way more ergonomic.",

            "body": "Before I start my rant, I wanna say that I'm a fanboy of peak design. I own several PD products, I love the company philosophy and design DNA and wanted to like this bag a lot. But, two things are making me think about returning this bag or already thinking of ways to modify it. I was planning to put my Camera Cube M and Sling 6L inside, and both fit in perfectly with room to spare and also put the travel duffel on top of my Rimowa Salsa Cabin luggage. I like to research a lot and go thru as many reviews as I can before buying stuff, but I don‚Äôt remember any other reviewer discussing the cons that I would like to talk about. (The pros are plenty and what the reviews say they are.)\n\nFirst of all, the handles are *atrocious*, I saw a bunch of reviews talking about how the magnets in the top handles are not strong enough, but they say it's a small gripe weighing against the pros of the bag. Never mind the magnets, I‚Äôm not talking about the magnets, the handles themselves are the most uncomfortable handles that I've ever used in my whole life, the rigidness makes it so uncomfortable and as soon as I pick it up I can feel like the handles are trying to pull apart from my hand. I hate picking this thing up already. The handles lay flat in your hand parallel to the floor, which makes it feel like you are holding two rulers in your hand rather than a handle. I understand they probably chose this design so that the consumer can double this bag as a backpack, but I just cannot understand how PD design team could pick this bag up and say this is acceptable. It‚Äôs a duffel bag and in my opinion, this should have been maybe the second thing they should have priority on perfecting this bag. They could have just used cheap canvas straps and it would probably be more comfortable than the current ones. My opinion is they just tried to kill two birds with one stone and it came out mediocre at best on both ends.\n\nMy second gripe is I was planning to use this bag as my primary bag for travel with my Rimowa Salsa Cabin, and wish they would have provided one more handle next to the main zipper so I can use it properly as pass-through on the handle to slide on my luggage. PD lists this on their website \"Hand straps double as luggage pass-through for roller bag carry\" I hope that they meant the handles on the bottom of the bag and not the main handles on the top of the bag, because if you use the main handles they are too way loose and just droop to the front if you are not extra careful making the luggage to tip over. The ones on the bottom have two small a loop in my case if that was what they were trying to say. Mine fits in barely, I have to wriggle it in really hard, and taking it out is even more ridiculous, it's like I'm a 34-size waist trying to fit into 31-size skinny jeans, I'm already having nightmares about trying to check in my luggage at the counter and just sweating all over trying to get my duffel bag off the damn luggage handle. I tried using my Sling 6L and that thing passes through perfectly fine. So, why didn't they make the handle loop the same distance as the Sling 6L? Or perhaps they did make it the same clearance, but because of placement and size of the bag the Sling 6L fits okay and the Travel Duffel 35L is struggling. If it is the same clearance, I hope PD makes the bottom loop clearances to be slightly bigger on the duffel in the future.

        "selftext": "I really like the design and simplicity of the 65l Duffelpack, but was worried that it would be too big. I could only find 1 video (produced by Peak Design) that showed that you could roll the top of the bag to compress it, but it did not say how much the bag held in that state. \n\nMy requirement was a simple travel backpack that held about the same as my 22\" roller suitcase (around 45l), but would also meet European carry-on requirements with the 45l of stuff in it. \n\nI bought the bag at the BF sale yesterday. Once back at home, I fully loaded my old 22\" suitcase to the max then transferred everything from that to the duffel pack (there was plenty of space left over especially at the ends). \n\nI found that I could then use the included straps to compress the pack down to 21x16x8 inches (which is a typical European carry on size) . The photos show the fully loaded duffel in comparison with the suitcase. \n\n [Side view](https://i.imgur.com/5KMhwV2.jpg)\n\n[Top view](https://i.imgur.com/AWCBTuf.jpg)\n\n[Showing how I use the straps ](https://i.imgur.com/BdIazFv.jpg)\n\nFor me, the advantage of getting the duffel pack over the PD 45l travel bag is that it is much lighter and when not on the plane (which is most of the trip) I have a nice large bag that I don't have to worry about carefully packing to squeeze everything back in to each time I pack. I also have plenty of room to add my thick jacket (that I would wear on the plane) or to hold things I might buy on the trip (though in that case may have to check it on the return trip).",

I often want to reach-in to grab my keys, a quick a case, my phone or laptop while i am walking to my office‚Ä¶ this just doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll accommodate that.\n\n2. This seems really badly designed for what breifcases are intended to do‚Ä¶ hold papers‚Ä¶ I know, papers are so old school, but in a professional setting, we often rely on papers (because we need to provide materials to other professionals or because we have case files, for example). My current briefcase makes storing and grabbing papers on the outside super simple without them getting crumpled-up. I don‚Äôt see this accomplishing that.\n\n3. This looks WAY too casual for any professional workspace. I can‚Äôt imagine wearing this with a suit. Canvas is a great, casual material that goes well with a suitcase, this just seems like an old boxy laptop bag by Lenovo or something. If you are in tech, maybe that‚Äôs fine. But it might not fit for many professional environments.\n\n4. The zippers don‚Äôt zip down the sides fully or at least to a gusset? That‚Äôs very important for easy access and pulling out papers without them getting crumpled.\n\n5. Water bottle holder INSIDE the briefcase? First‚Ä¶ if you need a briefcase for work, you probably work at an office, you have your own water sources. 2nd‚Ä¶ briefcases are for holding briefs. Hello‚Ä¶ no one is risking putting a water bottle in there. The umbrella is a cute idea as well, but a better option would have been an exterior strap.\n\nI‚Äôve got a few other beefs with the design. But I‚Äôll wait for more footage before i make a final decision.",

The zip slides smoothly too, which is typical of the PD line.\n\nOnly small niggle is that the interior zipper has no cover - I found out the hard way, when I had my laptop at the top, and it got scratched to sh\\*t :-( Oh, and there's no dedicated laptop sleeve...\n\nI go into more detail in my full review ([https://shotkit.com/peak-design-travel-duffelpack-review/](https://shotkit.com/peak-design-travel-duffelpack-review/) \\- aff links in there). The review didn't really resonate with the photographer community, as the Duffelpack isn't really marketed towards photographers, but thought you guys might appreciate it more.\n\nLeave me any questions about it below.",
