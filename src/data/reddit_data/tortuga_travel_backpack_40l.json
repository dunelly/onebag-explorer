        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great.

I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

With the 40 lite, I believe they removed their admin pocket and it’s all internal storage with maybe one zipper on the outside for a few items.

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

With the 40 lite, I believe they removed their admin pocket and it’s all internal storage with maybe one zipper on the outside for a few items. The aer is still comfortable for me, I’ve definitely slipped through being asked to weigh my bag on international flights because of it’s sleek look, and I’ve gotten better at packing for trips so I can probably start to go smaller on bags.

With the 40 lite, I believe they removed their admin pocket and it’s all internal storage with maybe one zipper on the outside for a few items.

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question! Updates to come…\n\nPictures attached.",

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question! Updates to come…\n\nPictures attached.",

Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question!

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I’m a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I’m not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I’m finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn’t have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it’s easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It’s also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it’s in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it’s a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa’s is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it’s just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don’t think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn’t great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, £ for £ it is a better bag than the Allpa. £60 vs £220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more…\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON’T KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I’m going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I’m not an expert in this area at all so it’s quite an unrefined review and there’s probably things I missed too!",

        "selftext": "I’m planning on a RTW trip (from London to SE Asia / Australia by land and sea) next year, and am using a 3 week trip to Cuba in April as my practice run for Onebagging. \n\nI‘ve had my eye on the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L for a while but has been out of stock in the UK since I began searching. Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (£220 vs £59.99). I’m not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa…\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I’m yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I’ll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is £160 better is another question! Updates to come…\n\nPictures attached.",

Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3.

Even after a short jog, it still prevented the laptop sliding completely to the bottom. I might still add a foam strip for peace of mind and might not work with a larger laptop, but interesting design if this keeps up!",

I couldn’t tell from the pictures, where’s the laptop compartment? I really hope it’s against the back of the bag and protected. Otherwise the bag wouldn’t be any different than their hiking bags - useless for digital nomads.",

Wish it did not go so high as the pack is stuck being tall. But perfect otherwise. \n\nMy idea, cut the bag open, cut the back part to a shorter size, then sew back together. But not wanting to ruin the durability of the bag.\n\nAny feedback would be great! Thanks",

I loaded up my usual winter loadout into the MLC, then tried to move everything into the TLB. The MLC took it all in stride, with a bit of room here and there for a few more items. Heck, I could even squeeze in a thin sweatshirt between the main compartment and the front panel flap if I wanted to.\n\nThe TLB, on the other hand, was a bit more challenging. I had to channel my inner Tetris master to fit everything in. My dual glasses case had didn't end up fitting inside so I shoved it into the water bottle holder. Let's just say it was a tight fit. No room for extras in this bag.\n\nSo, with a 4-week European tour coming up in October, it looks like my trusty Mini MLC is getting another stamp on its passport. If it were a summer trip, I' wouldn't hesitate to give the TLB a whirl. It's a solid bag, even if it doesn't have as many pockets as a pool table. But hey, I'm not one to use most of them anyway.\n\n# Packing List\n\n# Clothes\n\n* 1 shell/rain jacket\n* 1 400gsm wool thermal base layer\n* 4 synthetic tees\n* 2 pant Weatherproof Vintage\n* 4 thin wool blend socks\n* 5 synthetic underwear\n* 1 hybrid swim/walking shorts\n\n# Packing Cube\n\n* Peak Design Medium\n\n# Misc\n\n* toiletries\n* packable backpack (21L)\n* dual glasses case\n* travel cushion\n* med kit\n\n# Electronics\n\n* MacBook Pro Laptop\n* iPad mini (optional)\n* Minix travel charger\n* laptop charger\n* powerbank\n* cables\n* Travel router\n* AirPods Pro\n* Carbon Monoxide Detector",

You may get lucky on weather when you're there, but there will almost certainly be rain.  I lucked out and got dry weather the whole time I was hiking the Milford, Routeburn &amp; Kepler tracks, but got dumped out for 5 days straight when I was on the West Coast (in February as well).  Despite the rain, the hikes were incredible.  There were far fewer people and the mountains come alive when there is water pouring down the sides of them.  One of my favorite activities there was kayaking in the pouring rain in the Milford Sound, which would have been much less enjoyable without water gear (although I still would have done it anyways).\n\nIf you're more of a fair-weather hiker, or don't plan on much hiking, then disregard, but I'd bring a bit more weather protection so you can see the best of the country no matter what the weather.\n\nLastly, bring or buy a wide-brimmed hat.  The sun is no joke in Australia/NZ.  All the locals have them and for good reason.  There's some cute ones if you don't like the simple and functional bucket hats, but it will save your face from getting fried.",

Likewise, pack only merino blend wool socks that will dry out quickly.\n\nBut hand laundry with Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap, a full size backpacking towel to pre-wring out the water, and a backpacker's clothesline means you have clean, nice smelling clothes without having to take a few hours out of your trip to chase down laundry services. \n\nIf I am moving only once or twice on a trip, I will up it to 5 or 6 base tops and 5 or 6 base bottoms.\n\n If I have  3 or more transfers, the ease of 3 cute, quick dry/travel friendly tops and 3 cute quick dry/travel friendly shorts can not be beat.\n\nFor pants, 1 pair of jeans, 1 pair of leggings, and 1 pair of hiking pants are reasonable. I prefer 2 pairs of leggings for their versatility over hiking pants but I buy leggings that can work by themselves or layered.\n\nSkip the sweatshirts. Bring a button up wool sweater in a neutral color. This will provide versatility. You can layer it over your nice top for a night out in a cold restaurant. You can pack it as a layer hiking.\n\nLikewise, I would add a travel down jacket to replace the second sweatshirt. 32 degrees makes packable down jackets that are reasonable - $25 for regular length and $40 for the 3/4 length. A heavyweight fleece jacket can also work here but always looks a tad more outdoorsy. \n\nFor the bikinis, I would add some sort of wrap or cover up dress. 4 are reasonable if your plans include snorkeling, etc. You might have 1 on its first day of drying, 1 on its 2nd day of drying, wear one snorkeling in the morning and then want a 2nd one to hang out by a pool.",

            "body": "I'm getting ready for a couple overseas and domestic trips in the next few months. I've been looking for a suitable bag to meet my needs, which lead me to the selection of either the Eagle Creek Tour 40L or the popular Osprey Farpoint 40L. Both fit within my criteria of quality bags at the same exact price point with lifetime warranties, along with various other desirable traits.\n\nFor this comparison, I will mostly be adding pictures of the Eagle Creek as it is a newer bag with not a lot of information out there. Hopefully it can help people make up their decisions.\n\n**Internal Structure:**\n\nBoth Eagle Creek and Farpoint comes with a book (clam) style opening with easy access to the internals. Whereas the Farpoint 40L opens from top to bottom, and the EC opens up at from right to left. The Farpoint comes with a nice bright green high visibility interior, while the Eagle Creek is just black. Although on the EC it varies depending on the color you choose.\n\n[Comparison side by side](https://imgur.com/hYmY1NQ)\n\nIn terms of internal organization, both are very similar in terms of sizing. Both also come with internal clips. Here is a image where I quickly stuff the bag with a fully loaded EC Medium and Small packing cube, Marmot Precip, and 7 pairs of socks. Also in the internal pocket is an REI Co-op Flash 18L with my bladder, and 1 quart bag with toiletries.\n\n[Farpoint - Interior Loaded Up](https://imgur.com/3Gglzpm)\n\n[EC - Interior Loaded Up](https://imgur.com/SRbxE5P)\n\n**Size and Measurements:**\n\nBoth are rated at 40L, and I would say the measurement dimensions provided by both Farpoint and EC on their websites are correct. Although, in terms of capacity it seems the Farpoint can definitely hold more due to the outside pockets.\n\n[Picture of both bags side by side fully stuffed with clothes and towels](https://imgur.com/h4bb0VS)\n\nThe EC comes with a single side water bottle pouch, while the Farpoint comes with two back water bottle pouches. The EC bottle pouch seems to hold more. Here is an [image of the Farpoint](https://imgur.com/SiCa8lj) and [EC](https://imgur.com/wtWvdzQ) using my 18 oz Hydroflask. Not a fan of the Farpoint water bottle holders on the back, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nThe EC has the capability to expand to 43L according to the outside tag. I feel once you unzip the bag to provide the expanded capacity their sizes are more evenly matched.\n\n**Shoulder straps, hip belt, and sternum strap:**\n\nBoth come with a foam shoulder straps. The Farpoint shoulder straps are a bit wider, but the edgeless design on the EC make carrying the bag much more comfortable, at least for me. Also the EC has a more pronounced S curve as compared to the Farpoint which adds to the overall comfortable.\n\nBoth bags come with a sternum strap with a built in whistle. Although the EC is a stretchy material versus the Farpoint non-stretchy.\n\n[Side by side view](https://imgur.com/RREsfSN)\n\nThe Farpoint's hip belt is much better and provides more surface and cushion to wrap around your body. The straps are also wider than the 1 inch straps of the EC. The EC hip strap is pretty thin in comparison, but is also stowable which the Farpoint is not.\n\n[Image side by side](https://imgur.com/W8Nu6YB)\n\n[Hipbelt side by side](https://imgur.com/IP4zISJ)\n\nI also like to mention both bags have the ability to stow away the straps. The Farpoint has a wrap which can cover the shoulder and hip straps. The EC also has a type of strap and waist belt [cover](https://imgur.com/NVhO47V), but it also doubles as a [rain cover](https://imgur.com/lyNHOiR)! The EC also has an adjustable yoke that is secured to the back padded area using velcro.\n\n**External Features:**\n\nBoth the EC and Farpoint come with a top handle and side handle. [The Farpoint](https://imgur.com/SD0gIIX) handles are larger and have more cushion, but the [EC](https://imgur.com/mL4QUm1) is adequate in terms of sizing.\n\n[Side Handles](https://imgur.com/mhlGFf7)\n\nFarpoint has a one large external pocket with a laptop organizer which sits in the back, so it sits to the outside of the bag. Apparently a lot of people hate this feature, but I don't plan on carrying a laptop.\n\nEC has two minimalist pockets on the [outside](https://imgur.com/s0ZR9T0) with no organization. The bottom pocket does have a key leash. EC bag is the traditional laptop organization near the back of the bag with a side opening zipper. \n\nSpeaking of the [zippers](https://imgur.com/5dr1CF3), the Farpoint uses a larger YKK zipper and EC uses their own brand of zippers. I don't know why, but I expected the Farpoint zippers to be much smoother. It was quite the opposite, I found the EC to be smoother and easier to open. Opening the Farpoint was a bit of a pain, as the rain cover would often add resistance to the pulling of the zippers.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nYMMV! Everyone's body is ***DIFFERENT***. I got the M/L torso size for both bags as their respective sizing seem to match my body type. For this I thought the Farpoint would have been the clear winner here, but surprisingly I found the Eagle Creek to be much more comfortable even with the puny waist strap. Both bags seem to sit on my hip shelf well, but the [back lower padding](https://imgur.com/vJOMX5N) of the EC adds a lot of comfortable to my lower back. I feel the Farpoint adds more strain on my lower back over longer periods of time. I tested this by wearing the bag for about an hour or so.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAnyway, I hope this helps anyone out consider either of these two bags.  I'm about to put in my Amazon return, as I've tested these bags for a month now. In you are wondering, I am picking the Eagle Creek Tour 40L. But that is just my preference in terms of comfortable, organization, and aesthetic. Both bags are not perfect, but I feel more comfortable with the Eagle Creek. If I could just combine the high visibility interior and waist belt of the Farpoint with the Eagle Creek, it would have been near perfect.",

They did not check for dimensions, however they did check the weight.\n\nI was also carrying a small totepack and a sling, and given the strict 2-item limitation I had to “combine” the tote and the sling. Only during the counter check in though.\n\nThe tote and sling’s weight also were counted towards the 15kg allowance.\n\nBag was able to fit inside of the overhead bin compartment no problem, even on its expanded configuration.",

This bag is excellent for securely hauling your gear and packing it to the brim without having it look full, and getting from point A to point B.\n\nEven though I’ve hauled at least 10kg at any given time, I have no back pain whatsoever. (I do however have tired muscles, haha)\n\nThat said it is not a backpack that can double as a daypack. It’s just too much backpack. My recommendation would be to take any packable backpack, or even a simple totepack along with it.\n\nI got the Fjallraven High Coast Totepack, works great because it’s very light and packable, and the multiple carrying styles make it a great secondary backpack.\n\nFeel free to ask more questions if you have them!",
