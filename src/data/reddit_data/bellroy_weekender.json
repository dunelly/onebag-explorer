I've always been more of a duffel man vs a backpack guy, and this fills a nice for small duffel that is sort of \"Max Personal Item\" size.  With a luggage pass through, its perfect for sitting atop a rolling luggage, either carry on or check in size.  As I measure it, in its normal state 18\"x12\"x8\" though if you stuff it I'm thinking that the max depth is more like 9.5\" rather than 8\".  This would make a good gym bag too as it has a shoe compartment and supposedly waterproof exterior section for wet clothes.  There aren't a ton of squarish duffels that have a luggage pass through, and many \"travel\" duffels are longer and more for \"Max Carry On\" size and not the 18\" or so personal item size.    \n\n\nOverall I have no complaints, fabric feels pretty good and its not overly heavy, it has a stiffer foam piece on the bottom for structure, that will fold up to the side so it can be compressed flat for storage.  Its got some structure overall and stands up nice, the handles are good, the shoulder strap is good, the padded laptop section is nice and uncommon.  A good value overall.  Its probably most similar to the Aer Gym duffel (that has a nicer wider opening though) but at half the price.  I was also cross shopping the Kargo Xcavador (can be special ordered with luggage strap), DSPTCH weekender, and Bellroy weekender, Red Oxx Safari Beanos, all duffels with luggage pass throughs.  This one is a keepr for now though, as the price and the features are right.",

I've always been more of a duffel man vs a backpack guy, and this fills a nice for small duffel that is sort of \"Max Personal Item\" size.

As I measure it, in its normal state 18\"x12\"x8\" though if you stuff it I'm thinking that the max depth is more like 9.5\" rather than 8\".  This would make a good gym bag too as it has a shoe compartment and supposedly waterproof exterior section for wet clothes.  There aren't a ton of squarish duffels that have a luggage pass through, and many \"travel\" duffels are longer and more for \"Max Carry On\" size and not the 18\" or so personal item size.    \n\n\nOverall I have no complaints, fabric feels pretty good and its not overly heavy, it has a stiffer foam piece on the bottom for structure, that will fold up to the side so it can be compressed flat for storage.  Its got some structure overall and stands up nice, the handles are good, the shoulder strap is good, the padded laptop section is nice and uncommon.  A good value overall.  Its probably most similar to the Aer Gym duffel (that has a nicer wider opening though) but at half the price.  I was also cross shopping the Kargo Xcavador (can be special ordered with luggage strap), DSPTCH weekender, and Bellroy weekender, Red Oxx Safari Beanos, all duffels with luggage pass throughs.  This one is a keepr for now though, as the price and the features are right.",

Its got a lot of depth, which can take my X-T3 with a camera grip, which is sort of my minimum volume requirement.  The bag itself is very comfortable to wear, its light, and is soft against the body, the strap is really nice with the extension pull tab system super easy and fast to use.  I love that single magnet, quieter and faster than a zipper, it can be operated \"no-look\" and with one hand.  Great camera bag over all, really thought through for actual use.",

Performed just like I wanted giving me enough room for clothes and others.  Upon return I ordered the Arcade Grey to swap out.  \n\nSome quick notes, the straps are the same color on both.  The zipper guard is shiny on the shadow while matte on the Arcade grey.  The zipper pull is white on the shadow and black on the Arcade grey.  \n\nAs a bag collector and someone who probably has 30+ different bags you can imagine that the closet is full of black colored bags so wanted to mix it up a bit.  In addition when I travel with this one going forward, it’ll be nice to have it be distinct enough to stand out without screaming in a bright color.",

Just got the Tokyo Work Bag in and I'm comparing it to the Bellroy Via Work Bag (formerly the tech briefcase I think?) which I had for awhile.  The Tokyo Bag is a little bit larger all around, though they both have about the same sleeve padded laptop sleeve on the inside, its more than big enough to fit any 16\" or 15.6\" laptop in and out with ease (I have a Lenovo Thinkpad E15 gen4 for reference, fits no problem).  Both have the sleeve suspended from the bottom, but the via may actually suspend the sleeve higher because of its rounded bottom.  The Tokyo does have a flat padded bottom, which actually allows it to stand on its own (if not weight imbalanced by the laptop), the via cannot do that.    \n  \nOverall it feels like the Tokyo is made of slightly nicer to the touch materials.  The via feels smaller and more streamlined and utilitarian in comparison.  The Via has one big external pocket and the Tokyo has one zipper but two seperate external pockets, I think I like the Via's single pocket more, I can stick an umbrella or drink in it, keeping the main compartment dry.  The Tokyo does have an external sleeve on the side that can take a shorter umbrella or drink though, and it does have more useful pockets within the main compartment.  The spartan Via only has a sleeve and the sunglass mesh pocket.  I've decided to keep the Tokyo mostly cause of its greater size and color, but mostly because I have a heavier laptop and the slightly more cushy strap (with free floating pad which I prefer) works better for me.    \n  \nIf you are interested I'm selling my Via, check out my listing on the B/S/T thread and PM me or I also have it for sale on the Nomad Nation store on [District.net](https://district.net/nomads?tab=listings&amp;seller=jonuiuc)   I also have a few other bags I've posted about on sale there: the CT15 v3, CT3, and a Cotopaxi Luzon.

I packed it up like I would on a flight with a Hydroflask, an Eagle Creek quarter packing cube with a light merino layer, and my EDC Tom Bihn Side Effect. My sunnies case and a coin purse with advil/nail clippers/etc... went in the inside pocket and keys clipped to the leash. It folds down into quarters slightly smaller than the 1/4 packing cube and much thinner. It can also roll up into a large fist sized roll but I think that would take up unnecessary space in my main bag (either a Kanken, a Tom Bihn Paragon or S25 depending on the trip).\n\nThe whole tote is really light, not much more than the packable grocery bags I use. I'll likely fold it into quarters and slide it in the top of my main pack, with the Side Effect worn cross body. Before boarding I'll slide out the tote, throw in the Side Effect and pop all my in flight bits in. There is still room for a bigger sweater or snacks and the book I inevitably acquire while waiting to board. The straps are a good length to wear over a jacket and not too slippery. I prefer a tote to be wider than tall and this is visually a good size on me but might look a little small if you're a big guy (I'm a US size 16, 5ft 10\" tall woman). I do wish there was a clip or something to hold it rolled up but other than that it's great.",

I packed it up like I would on a flight with a Hydroflask, an Eagle Creek quarter packing cube with a light merino layer, and my EDC Tom Bihn Side Effect. My sunnies case and a coin purse with advil/nail clippers/etc... went in the inside pocket and keys clipped to the leash. It folds down into quarters slightly smaller than the 1/4 packing cube and much thinner. It can also roll up into a large fist sized roll but I think that would take up unnecessary space in my main bag (either a Kanken, a Tom Bihn Paragon or S25 depending on the trip).\n\nThe whole tote is really light, not much more than the packable grocery bags I use. I'll likely fold it into quarters and slide it in the top of my main pack, with the Side Effect worn cross body. Before boarding I'll slide out the tote, throw in the Side Effect and pop all my in flight bits in. There is still room for a bigger sweater or snacks and the book I inevitably acquire while waiting to board. The straps are a good length to wear over a jacket and not too slippery. I prefer a tote to be wider than tall and this is visually a good size on me but might look a little small if you're a big guy (I'm a US size 16, 5ft 10\" tall woman). I do wish there was a clip or something to hold it rolled up but other than that it's great.",

The Slim did however slip into any of the pockets of my tp2.\n\nAlso, the materials are wonderful. Feels sturdy and is very water resistant. Best of all, cleans very easily under running water and some dish soap. Photos don’t do the material justice. It looks and feels much nicer in hand!\n\nMy only issue was the aquaguard zipper that didnt quite close to the very end. I had a little water and dampness still inside from a hastily packed rush to the airport, and for better or worse, the water had collected inside the very water resistant material and seeped thru that small gap. Not a big deal cause you can force it to be a tighter close but something to note.\n\nI did try the peak design wash pouch small, the aforementioned explorer slim, as well as my then current matador flat toiletries kit.\n\nWill do a comp. But sufficed to say, the mini won me over with its roominess, compact shape, and solid materials.",

My backpack isn’t going anywhere so the replacement must have the ability to use just a sling (no backpack straps on a duffle). Using the Patagonia arbor duffle I don’t mind carrying it and I feel quicker on my feet than with a roller bag in the airport. I’m thinking 32-36l would be the sweet spot maybe 40l MAX. I don’t need a bag with all sorts of organization for my purposes and packing style. \n\nWith that out of the way, I’m considering the following 2:\n\nRed Oxx small aviator kit- https://www.redoxx.com/products/small-aviator-kit-bag?_pos=4&amp;_sid=c77121b50&amp;_ss=r\n\nSeems well made, not sure about the zipper type though and would like at least a small slip pocket on the front (not a deal breaker though). \n\nDSPTCH Weekender ballistic- https://www.dsptch.com/products/overnight-duffle-ballistic-nylon?_pos=6&amp;_sid=fc55b7e35&amp;_ss=r\n\nSeems nice, lined, an outside slip pocket but I’m not real sure about this brand or model. Not a lot of reviews that I’ve seen anyway. \n\nHelp me decide?  I’d consider the GR Kit 32l but I don’t like the colors available right now. Other options?\n\n",

The price, vagueness of materials, the weird marketing that wasn't unlike anything Bellroy- I just flat out didn't like the bag.\n\nFast forward a few days and I couldn't get my mind off that gorgeous Onyx colour. It reminds me of some volcanic stones I saw by the sea a few years back. Not quite black, not quite grey- but somewhere in between.\n\nSo I bit the bullet. $749 NZD ($450ish USD)  plus shipping and it was at my doorstep in less than 24 hours. Pretty impressive given it came from another country in the midst of a global pandemic.\n\nI will take some better photos tomorrow but first impressions are:\n\n1. It isn't as big as I thought it would be. Not a bad thing but 25L is pretty much my limit for EDC- anything larger then I am probably going to pick up a duffle or weekender.  The dimensions, especially width, make it look really wide but I see now that they measured at the very top of the bag where the flap folds. The body is a more manageable size.\n2. It's quite lightweight. I just thought it would be quite heavy given all the leather used and aluminium hardware but it's not bad at all. It isn't featherlight but I wouldn't call it obnoxiously heavy as something from Filson.\n3. Aesthetics wise, I think it's a good match. It doesn't look too heritage like a Filson, doesn't look too futuristic like a Peak Design, it's not military inspired like a GoRuck or Wandrd, nor is it leaning too much towards sleek streetwear like you'd get from AER or DSPTCH. I think this wouldn't look out of place while travelling with a technical lightweight jacket or heading down to a friend's house in a white shirt and jeans.\n\nI'm not sure if I will end up keeping this yet since hey it's a lot of money but for the moment I really am impressed. It's nowhere near worth the asking price but it is definitely a step above my other Bellroy stuff.",

My backpack isn’t going anywhere so the replacement must have the ability to use just a sling (no backpack straps on a duffle). Using the Patagonia arbor duffle I don’t mind carrying it and I feel quicker on my feet than with a roller bag in the airport. I’m thinking 32-36l would be the sweet spot maybe 40l MAX. I don’t need a bag with all sorts of organization for my purposes and packing style. \n\nWith that out of the way, I’m considering the following 2:\n\nRed Oxx small aviator kit- https://www.redoxx.com/products/small-aviator-kit-bag?_pos=4&amp;_sid=c77121b50&amp;_ss=r\n\nSeems well made, not sure about the zipper type though and would like at least a small slip pocket on the front (not a deal breaker though). \n\nDSPTCH Weekender ballistic- https://www.dsptch.com/products/overnight-duffle-ballistic-nylon?_pos=6&amp;_sid=fc55b7e35&amp;_ss=r\n\nSeems nice, lined, an outside slip pocket but I’m not real sure about this brand or model. Not a lot of reviews that I’ve seen anyway. \n\nHelp me decide?  I’d consider the GR Kit 32l but I don’t like the colors available right now. Other options?\n\n",

            "body": "This particular model isn't sold anymore, but the \"eBags Motherload\" is the successor. I bought this backpack in February of 2011. It's been to the other side of the world with me 6 times, been to different cities and states in the US dozens of times for work, and I've been taking it on thrice weekly shopping trips for years. The thing just doesn't quit.\n\nAs long as you don't get one with a manufacturing defect the thing will last you a lifetime. That's really the only complaint most people have about them, and they get surprisingly few complaints. (And we know how Amazon reviewers like to complain.) When I bought mine the bottom of the left shoulder strap had a stitching error that caused to to unravel once I had loaded it and put it on. I let them know and they simply sent me a different one. The replacement has been my first choice bag for any trip since then. When I came back from my trip, I had the original bag that had the defect. They didn't ask for it back, and I hate throwing things away, so I tried my hand at re-stitching the shoulder strap, and surprise, surprise it worked. And has been my second carry-on on all my subsequent trips. I don't trust my stitching completely, so I usually use that one in hand bag mode. Tuck the shoulder straps in their pocket and carry it by the handle.\n\nIt's as large as it can be and still go under the seat on an airplane. They're the perfect travel bags for me and they look almost as good as they did the day I bought them. They also carry two or three bags of groceries as well when I use them for my walking trips to the supermarket.\n\nThe \"eBags Motherload\" is the replacement for the \"eTech Convertable\". They both have the same external dimensions (i.e. as large as they can be and still be a carry-on) but the Motherload has a more stylish look and some improvements in comfort regarding the straps. As far as I can tell they are made with the same tough materials and heavy duty construction.\n\nIf I have any complaint about them it would be that it is NOT a hiking backpack. I mean, that should be obvious, it's a travel pack, says so in the description, right? But that really is the only complaint I have about it. If you load it up with 30 to 50 pounds of stuff and start walking with it after a mile or two the straps really start to hurt your clavicles. All the weight of the bag is on those shoulder straps. There is no belt to distribute some of the weight to your hips. So if you're going to be backpacking across the world you might want to go with a hiking backpack instead. This is fine to hold 30 to 50 pounds of stuff for the walk from the parking lot to your gate and from your gate to the next gate and from the next gate through immigration to your taxi, but if you want to walk for miles and miles and miles with 30 to 50 pounds on your back, you're really going to want something to distribute some of the load to your hips.",

        "selftext": "Scooped this bellroy classic plus second hand for 80$. Wasn’t in need of it, impulse buy since I already use the AER CPP. Super stoked I grabbed it for. Really nice bag. \n\nTotally different from the CPP. Both 24L yet the bellroy is much slimmer and seems to hold less. Better for EDC. CPP has been nice for an overnight/minimal weekend tripper. \n\nAlso dig the bellroy look, less utilitarian than AER.",

I carried it, and an Aer Day Sling 2, for 7 days winter trip to The Netherlands, followed by a 3 day trip to Noosa (Sunshine Coast, Australia, during summer), so it’s not THAT small. 🤷🏻‍♂️",
