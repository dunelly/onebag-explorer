        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/bdg2dx/this_is_getting_ridiculous_i_went_from_44_to_22/",
        "selftext": "*WARNING: this post is a bit like one of Tynan's yearly gear posts. I'll be commenting on various items as I list them. It's a bit of a long read. Don't say I didn't warn you ;)*\n\nI *really* love my 22 liter Heimplanet Monolith Daypack, but using it as a daypack is actually a bit inconvenient in my opinion, due to its size and shape. As a frontloading backpack for travel it works really well, but then I take a separate daypack with me to use when I'm out and about.\n\nOn nice weather trips where I don't need much clothing/layers or a laptop, it's way too spacious. Also stuffing it under the seat in front of me on an airplane doesn't leave much space for my feet. I'd like to be able to stretch my legs, but I also love having my main bag with me during the flight, omitting the need to transfer in-flight necessities to another bag, thus further simplifying travel, which is the main reason I onebag.\n\nSo, I bought an IKEA Starttid backpack for €7,99 a while ago, which holds about 14 liters (39x27x13 cm). It has a clamshell design and a neutral look. Unlike the Heimplanet it feels really cheap, exactly as you would expect from an eight euro backpack (or maybe not, considering some of Decathlon's offers). IKEA recently stopped selling it by the way; this year's Starttid backpacks lost the clamshell design, their main selling point for me.\n\nToday I did a trial packing for my next trip, which is due in about a month. The packed bag weighs 4.1 kg. So what's in the bag?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4l8mtw3ffs21.jpg?width=2201&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c465f783a984dcd95292dfd706b7c1d5b15479a9\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c71e6yw3ffs21.jpg?width=3120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dba48f9e4550d303ae28c14b4a3f9a7afa1101c2\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A packing cube with mainly clothes, a toiletry bag, a tech pouch, sandals, a cap and some EDC items.](https://preview.redd.it/vk6wpzw3ffs21.jpg?width=3611&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6361c8f30bf7c2554add249005ae5b3965da8b24)\n\n# Clothing cube\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veaqrrjqffs21.jpg?width=4160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b0151d262b09b5ab32eda2071114a167ca13c21\n\nThis is an IKEA packing cube from 2016 which incidentally fits the backpack perfectly (it's just as wide).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t4mv803tffs21.jpg?width=3648&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb7d13140495b844d4fb69eb910ecdb5d4cecde6\n\nRanger roll all the things! Keeps everything neat even if you remove some items from the packing cube.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxfzkrzegfs21.jpg?width=3120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b431219cb563bd127865472fb6aa185bde4c45\n\n* **t-shirt** *I have an identical one that I'll be wearing*\n\n87% merino wool, 13% nylon. Spent some money to see if I could wear this for weeks on end, but it gets smelly just as fast as cotton t-shirts that are ten times as cheap, which I usually wash after wearing them for ten consecutive days. Merino wool may make a difference for those that get only one or two days out of cotton t-shirts though. I use odor-free deodorant by the way, which helps keep your t-shirt smell neutral instead of accumulating an odor of stale deodorant.\n\nI got a second t-shirt for free after I informed customer service of some pilling that I noticed after I washed it for the first time. I was afraid it meant that the t-shirt would develop holes really soon, but after two summers of wearing them (and only them, I don't own any other t-shirts as I keep an extremely minimal wardrobe at home as well) they're still in good condition.\n\nSince I know someone will ask: it's an Icebreaker Tech Lite Short Sleeve V-Neck.\n\n* **pullover**\n* **fleece jacket**\n\nIt might be cold in the mornings and evenings on my planned camping trip and that night I'm staying at a Buddhist temple on a mountain. If I would only stay in the city, I probably wouldn't take my fleece jacket—it's usually 20 to 25 °C during the day and on average 15 °C during the night where I'm heading. Which, by the way, is Kyoto and Tokyo plus surrounding cities. During the second half of May.\n\n* **summer/rain jacket**\n* **convertible pants** *I have another pair that I'll be wearing*\n\nI love convertible pants. They are long pants, shorts and swimming trunks in one. I often convert between pants and shorts when travelling. Either you go out early and it's still really cold, or it gets cold during or at the end of the day. It's hard to find a decent looking pair without cargo pockets and excessive branding though.\n\nFor now I've settled for the [Wildebeast Blaine Woven outdoor pants](https://www.perrysport.nl/product/bruin-wildebeast-blaine-woven-1-rits-outdoor-broek-bruin-heren/737418_perrysport/). They're quick drying—which is really nice when you get caught in a sudden downpour or when using them for swimming—, have a regular fit (where most convertible pants are quite baggy) and look pretty decent; almost like a normal 5-pocket pant. They have a hidden zippered pocket on one of the legs, and a piece of stretch fabric on the inside of the waist, which you can tighten or loosen and omits the need for a real belt—without making the pants look ugly.\n\nUnlike some other brands out there, they also don't cost an arm and a leg at just €49,99. I even paid only €37,49 during a promotion (buy two, get 50% off on the second one). The color on the pair I wore last summer for weeks on end as shorts changed in the sunlight though, which I found out after finally zipping on the bottom legs at the end of summer. I went to the store, they said it's not supposed to happen and gave me a new pair, but the internet says it happens a lot with cheap zip-off pants. We'll see how it goes this summer...\n\n* **briefs** *I have another pair that I'll be wearing*\n\n83% merino Wool, 12% nylon, 5% spandex. Just one spare pair in the bag. I usually (when not traveling) wear these for 10 consecutive days before washing them, and I reckon I could go much longer. As long as I take them off during the night, they don't start smelling. YMMV.\n\nThey're Icebreaker Anatomica Briefs.\n\n* **boxer shorts**\n\nJust one pair to wear at night/morning when I'm in a shared accomodation. I feel a bit naked walking around and going to the toilet or shower in briefs.\n\n* **3 pairs of sneaker socks**\n\nI'll probably only need two, washing them daily in the shower. It's nice to have a backup pair though in case the washed pair isn't dry on time, or I damage a pair.\n\n* **linen towel**\n\nIKEA Vardagen dish towel, 50x70 cm. Most places I'll be staying will provide a towel. Otherwise I'll have this one, which hardly takes up any space, dries quickly and is anti-microbial. Never had issues with synthetic travel towels though, but I thought I'd check out what the hype is all about.\n\n* **small synthetic laundry bag**\n\nIn case I need to store dirty laundry in my bag, I keep it separated from clean items using this. I've used it for dirty socks and underwear in the past, but I'm taking so little stuff now that I'm not sure if I need this at all.\n\n* **travel clothes line**\n\nThere's not always a good place for hang drying or airing out things. This fixes that.\n\n* **glasses in case**\n\nJust in case something goes wrong with my contact lenses or my eyes get irritated and I can't wear them. I've luckily never needed this before, but I wouldn't want to have spent lots of money to get somewhere and then not be able to see clearly, so I'm always taking it.\n\n* **washcloth and microtowel**\n\nI like to walk barefoot, which can result in dirty feet. I just realised I only need the washcloth to clean my feet, wether on the go or at my accomodation. So the microtowel is not coming.\n\n# Toiletry bag\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6juet4ikgfs21.jpg?width=3120&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3421dd6a72deb996233991e75a77f34dd45f0c2\n\nI use a transparent 1 liter cosmetic bag for toiletries, so I conform to the regulations regarding liquids in carry-on luggage and I can just take it out at customs.\n\n* **contact lens solution**\n\nSince I still have to go out and buy the travel-size bottle, I substituted with deodorant for this trial, which is about the same size.\n\n* **contact lens case**\n* **contact lens remover** *plus one spare in case one goes down the drain or something*\n* **deodorant**\n* **sunscreen**\n* **foldable toothbrush**\n* **toothpaste**\n* **nail scissors**\n* **tweezers**\n\nWhen I go out barefoot, I bring tweezers, just in case anything small and sharp gets stuck in the sole of my foot.\n\n* **paracetamol (acetaminophen)**\n\nJust a few in case I fall ill at night or something. If I do, I'll get more at the nearest convenience store, drugstore or even my accomodation. The same applies to the next item in this list.\n\n* **band aid**\n\nI stopped using soap, shampoo and hair gel years ago, so there's none of that.\n\n# Tech pouch\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9z639x91hfs21.jpg?width=4160&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50e252ee6397624c5f49098f48fbfc3cbd81ab19\n\n* **USB cable**\n* **USB charger**\n* **travel adapter**\n* **10,000 mAh power bank**\n\nI'm not sure if I actually need this. It's always nice to know you can charge your phone on the go though, especially when you get lost in the outdoors and you need the GPS, flashlight or just need to be able to dial the emergency number.\n\nAlso, I thought I'd use it on the 11-hour flight from Amsterdam to Tokyo to keep my smartphone charged while reading an e-book. But last time I was on an airplane I noticed the in-flight entertainment system had USB-ports, so I could just connect my phone to that instead.\n\nAnother intended use when I bought it was to use it in hostels where there's no wall outlet near your bed and you don't want to leave your phone unattended while charging. Haven't encountered hostels without wall outlet at each bed though.\n\n* **trimmer**\n\nIn my quest for the perfect shaving solution, I ended up with this Gillette Styler. It's about the size of a thick permanent marker, runs on one AA battery and trims your facial hair back to a five o'clock shadow. Sadly (or luckily, depending on how you look at it) I'm not blessed with much beard growth, so I only need to use this once a week. Unlike traditional travel shavers this also works when my facial hair is a bit longer, and it's smaller. Not a good solution if you require a very close shave though.\n\nYou know the blister packaging of round paracetamol tablets? I cut out one of the round plastic shapes that hold the tablets and put it on top of the battery inside the trimmer, so it can't accidentally turn on in my bag. Fits perfectly!\n\n* **2FA device for online banking**\n\n# Misc\n\n* **sandals + pouch**\n* **cap**\n* **flexible water bottle**\n\nBecause it's flexible, it only takes up as much space as there's water in it. In the picture it holds 500 milliliters, is quite flat and unlike round bottles can easily be stored in a tight space (a lot of times there's a bit of \"flat\" space left in my bag, but not so much \"round\" space).\n\nI've been able to fill it at taps that didn't leave room for a round bottle underneath them. Because you can just fold this one, you can fill it even in those situations.\n\n* **enormous paperback book**\n\nIt's about the size of a 10 inch tablet, but much thicker of course. It takes up an awful amount of space (more than 1 liter), but I only put it in when I found out I still had room for it.\n\nI'll get rid of it when finished, but that might still mean lugging it along for most of my trip. I'm not sure if I want to do that—I'd rather have my bag packed a little less tight, so I have more spare room for food, zipped-off trouser legs and a pullover/vest without having to roll those up super neatly when taking them off when out and about—, so I might just take an e-book instead.\n\n* **plastic bag for various uses**\n\nE.g. to sit on a dirty surface when hiking, to store a wet towel after swimming.\n\n# Front pocket\n\n* **wallet**\n\nIt's the [Fritzvold Tiny Wallet](https://fritzvold.de/products/tiny-wallet), a minimal wallet with integrated RFID-blocking that stores cards, bills and coins.\n\n* **earphones**\n* **earplugs**\n* **pen**\n* **lip balm**\n* **caffeine pills**\n* **passport (in RFID-blocking pouch)**\n\n# Wearing\n\nSo I'll be wearing the other briefs, t-shirt, zip-off pants, one pair of the socks and these shoes:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ou5wryugfs21.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1777b75f8b8b236e716291d61d837b7e302f0426\n\nThey are the Vivobarefoot Gobi II Eco Suede, and while not perfect, they are my current *One Shoe To Rule Them All* ;)\n\nI'll also be carrying my smartphone, and that's about it!\n\nI will stay at lots of different places during my trip, checking out in the morning and checking in somewhere else in the evening, so I'm happy to have such a light and small pack that I can carry with me all day without much effort :)\n\nThanks for reading and if you have any questions I'll try my best to answer them!",

Hope others find it useful too!\n\nCould've dropped the MPL3.5 in all honesty - CHZ is a cavern but also totally doable as a daypack on arrival. But it's nice to have the sling option at my destination.\n\nThis is 5 weeks in Ontario, Canada, part working part leisure. Coming from the UK.\n\nUpgraded to the CHZ26 from a Heimplanet Monolith Daypack 22L which had served me well for years but was never especially well made and I wasn't big on the look. Loving the cheez so far.",
