All the things with plenty of holders, a lightmeter and a filter setup fit comfortably inside the shimoda action v2 50l backpack that I have here and I use a large dslr core unit for it. The bagpack is very comfy and nicely padded. Extra point for the juicy yellow and the option to exchange core units to free/unfree extra space. The tripod is extra since I use a big and heavy one so I usually carry that on my shoulder for ergonimics. I like that the shimoda bagpack has the opening on the back so I don't have to lay it on the side that will be on my back later on. I find it quite good of a space for this big setup with multiple lenses. \nI also took the camera with me on a multi day hike in Finnish Lappland a few weeks ago and managed to fit it all inside the side pockets of a fjäll räven kajka 85L so it was very accessible the whole hike through. You can argue how smart it is to carry that much stuff extra on a week-long hike but I didn't mind. The chamonix camera came inside a padded bag and for the lenses I got a 19in padded square from the long weekend brand. Very good thingy since I fit two lenses inside there. Ofc I had to bring a darkbag and extra film but it was actually quite relaxing reloading in the mornings in the tent xD. I took a graflex back which fits 6 sheets of film but is only 1.5 regular filmholder thicknesses thick. I didn't double expose and I guess my copy is a good one since it didn't clog up or anything. Very happy with all of that. I had a lighter tripod head from benro than what I use usually, but took my induro at413 legs (a bit of luxury has to be) which turned out to be a very good idea since it was very windy.\nDoes anyone have a good solution for storage of exposed film sheets on a trip like this? It is not really a thing to take 15 holders just to take 30 exposures. Maybe I will post some images of my trip here in a few days.\n",

Otherwise, any kind of soft case that keeps stuff organized will work.\n\nSometimes you are surprised.   In Japan a bus driver said \"everything\" goes in the lower luggage compartments, no exceptions.  Some kind of safety rule and I was not prepared to argue in Japanese.\n\nI generally keep everything in hard pelican brand cases.   \n\n  \nOnce me and one other guy were making a video for a white water raft company.  This was year ago when the gear was huge and filled two cases plus the tripod.    We went 2 hours ahead in an open canoe, so we could set up and wait for the comany's rafts.  We dumped the canoe and the cases took a swim through some white water and rocks.   We swam it all to shore and opened up the cases and set up the shot.      Same when I did underwater work.    SOme one is always going to drop a tank or some wet stuff soaking on saltware on you stuff.   But if it is in a hard case, I don't care.   The routine was always to rinse the case with fresh water BEFORE you open it EVERY time,  Dive boats always have a large tub of fresh water just for this purpose",
