            "body": "My never ending tryouts for everyday laptop briefcases for my work commute continues.  Just got the Tokyo Work Bag in and I'm comparing it to the Bellroy Via Work Bag (formerly the tech briefcase I think?) which I had for awhile.  The Tokyo Bag is a little bit larger all around, though they both have about the same sleeve padded laptop sleeve on the inside, its more than big enough to fit any 16\" or 15.6\" laptop in and out with ease (I have a Lenovo Thinkpad E15 gen4 for reference, fits no problem).  Both have the sleeve suspended from the bottom, but the via may actually suspend the sleeve higher because of its rounded bottom.  The Tokyo does have a flat padded bottom, which actually allows it to stand on its own (if not weight imbalanced by the laptop), the via cannot do that.    \n  \nOverall it feels like the Tokyo is made of slightly nicer to the touch materials.  The via feels smaller and more streamlined and utilitarian in comparison.  The Via has one big external pocket and the Tokyo has one zipper but two seperate external pockets, I think I like the Via's single pocket more, I can stick an umbrella or drink in it, keeping the main compartment dry.  The Tokyo does have an external sleeve on the side that can take a shorter umbrella or drink though, and it does have more useful pockets within the main compartment.  The spartan Via only has a sleeve and the sunglass mesh pocket.  I've decided to keep the Tokyo mostly cause of its greater size and color, but mostly because I have a heavier laptop and the slightly more cushy strap (with free floating pad which I prefer) works better for me.    \n  \nIf you are interested I'm selling my Via, check out my listing on the B/S/T thread and PM me or I also have it for sale on the Nomad Nation store on [District.net](https://district.net/nomads?tab=listings&amp;seller=jonuiuc)   I also have a few other bags I've posted about on sale there: the CT15 v3, CT3, and a Cotopaxi Luzon.  If you use code: JONUIUC at checkout, it should given you $5 off your first purchase.  Please subsidize my bag habit lul.",

                "body": "I sold the via shortly after this post, but that one had no issues with the strap mount since the g clip on the strap was flat and the mount was flat.  I think you are referring to the strap mounts on the Tokyo which are fabric and the strap attachments are triangle shaped metal clips.  This triangle shape did seem like it would start to fray the fabric strap mount, I saw the same reports, so what I did was put a metal d ring on it so I would have a metal ring for the metal triangles to swing on, so I have no wear on mine.  I used something like this:  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BN9V1RX?smid=AR22DAIJPH3FU&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09BN9V1RX?smid=AR22DAIJPH3FU&amp;th=1)    \nIt prob is not a problem if you don't remove the strap often.",

Just got the Tokyo Work Bag in and I'm comparing it to the Bellroy Via Work Bag (formerly the tech briefcase I think?) which I had for awhile.

And despite the shoulder straps needing to accommodate being ‘hidden’ out the way I still find them comfy and big enough.   \nOnly downside is the water bottle pockets being inside, but I can always hang it off the little strappy bits at the top.   \nOverall - love it!",

Two outer pockets for water, water bottles/umbrella, the nice short grab handles, and overall professional look.  \n  \nI have looked at Alpaka bravo totepack and the Bellroy via workpack/ Tokyo totes amongst others (Fjallraven high coast) , but I’m struggling to find some thing I love \n \n Anyone have any other suggestions? I’m currently in Germany, so the Stuart and Lau is a bit $$$ plus shipping and vat so am interested in other similar options.    \n  \nIdeally, smaller than 18 L, as I want something rather slim and easy to carry by hand as that is what I will primarily use it for to complement a larger weekender or travel bag.\n  \nBonus points if there is  bright/High contrast interior. \n \nLooking for any cool suggestions!",

I wanted something lighter, with better organization and water resistant than my vintage Jansport Skip Yowell bag.\n\nIt’s thin and stands on its own. The backpack straps could be a little more padded but that’s not a dealbreaker for me. It being water inside was a nice surprise to me because it has an internal water bottle space. The main compartment is waterproof and protects the laptop compartment.",
