I did some research, saw that the side pockets can fit a 48oz Nalgene and was sold. These bags are expensive BUT they’re worth it. I’ve went on 4 trips since buying this bag and have zero regrets. This bag carries more than any carry-on I’ve ever owned and yet because it’s a backpack that doesn’t look too big, airlines never give me any trouble with it. \n\nThe build quality is incredible. I have no doubt in my mind that it’s buy it for life quality. \n\nBefore investing the money into this pack, I struggled finding any information/reviews of it online. So, if you’re curious/interested in this pack, ask away! I’m happy to answer questions about my ownership experience.\n\n",

                "body": "It can pack relatively flat, but the material and especially the handles and webbing that wraps around it is very stiff.  Also it is pretty heavy for its size due to the materials and the metal D rings.\n\nAs far as an extra bag, I definitely have used it for this before and it worked out well.  The bag is tough as nails and has no issues being checked for the return flight home.  I've also checked my Air Boss bag probably 20+ times and no issues at all.\n\nI'd say it works great as a packable bag, but only if it's for a rolling suitcase where the added weight of the bag isn't a big deal, and only if you plan to check it in and you want to ensure the bag will last and not rip apart in tranist.  If you're trying to carry this in a backpack travel bag or plan to carry it on the plane and not check it, this bag is kinda overkill and a lighter/thinner material would be a better bet.",

It's just my Red Oxx Metro Laptop Briefcase bag looking pretty much exactly like it has for seven years of miserable abuse now: apart from a slightly faded color (hot California sun, and way too much of it), this thing is just as it was the day it arrived. I *tore* through bags prior to this one. Six months and I'd be busting zippers, tearing holes, ripping straps from the side. I stuff them too full and haul them around courthouses, jails, in and out of my trunk in a huge hurry, etc., giving them zero thought. This bag has been in and out of some ugly places (well, for a white-collar work bag) and keeps on keeping on. I **love it** and will buy my kids Red Oxx backpacks soon because I trust this brand so much I know that when they graduate and go off to college years from now, they'll be able to take the same exact bag, if they want. \n\nRed Oxx is a legit BIFL brand that you can get your hands on right now. It's made in the USA by a veteran-owned company. \n\nThe last I saw about Red Oxx when I searched here (Reddit search is a dumpster fire, I know) was from like a year ago, and a mention six months ago, so I thought it was appropriate to share this now. The brand deserves a lot of love, as much love as the people who value Buying It For Life can give it.",
