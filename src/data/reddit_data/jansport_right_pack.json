When you color grade it, you can get away with it, but this whole situation has really frustrated a lot of the OG's who have been pleading for a proper rerelease, only to get yet another alt option.",

Not smooth whatsoever.\n\n**Is the laptop compartment good?**  \nNot really. See next question.\n\n**Does it have a false bottom?**  \nSorta? the back laptop compartment goes down to that bottom leather and stops. I do NOT recommend keeping a laptop in here without some form of cushioned sleeve case. I was also looking for a Jansport with a solid laptop compartment, but this does not have the best one.  \n\n\n**Is it worth buying over the regular Right Pack?**  \nI have not daily driven a normal Right Pack, but I mostly got it because it was on sale from Tilly's. It seems like the main difference is just the slightly more premium outer material? I wasn't able to find a lot of good information about it.\n\nI mostly wanted a basic Black backpack with leather accents and it does the job for the looks. I have a better TomToc x-pac that I would use if I was camping or going somewhere rugged. But I do no such things.",

I know I knoowwww I can probably get a different model but I’ve been eyeing this thing for a while, and it seems to suit my needs the best. Is there a kind of recommended sealant to make the bottom a little more wet resistant? Would that be advised?\n\nLinked the bag I’m talking about",

I know they are quite differently aesthetically, but I guess I'm a fan of the clean look and suede contrast on the Jansport (would probably rip off the logo patch) and the techwear-esque-but-still-relatively-minimal feel of the DSPTCH.\n\nI know there are a ton of threads already but I'm not a huge fan of the common recommendations. I actually have an Everlane Snap already and it's fine, but not quite what I have in mind. I'm also not very interested in the Fjällräven Känken or the Côte&amp;Ciel Isar.\n\nAny opinions on the two above or alternatives?",

            "body": "Hey - I wrote this review nearly two years ago on my Kifaru bag. It was for a now defunct blog, hence the length. [Pics album here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3iFJwnSKYgUHs1oy5)\n\n* Background\n   * Before the Antero, I carried a GR1 as my everyday, do everything backpack since 2011. This past summer I also purchased a GR10 bullet ruck to use for day trips and light hiking. I also have a Tom Bihn Aeronaut 30 which I've used for Travel. My hope with the Antero was to replace all three bags. I couldn't find much in the way of detailed reviews of the Antero, so I thought I would add mine to the mix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Bag layout\n   * The Antero has one large zippered compartment that opens completely for flat packing. Kifaru put the zipper towards the top of the pack, much like a traditional roller bag, instead of halfway between two open panels.\n   * Kifaru added 2 extra zipper pulls to the compartment so you can access things near the bottom of your pack without completely opening the pack. An example of a well-thought out pack: these bottom pulls have small tabs which secure them when not in use.\n   * Inside the main compartment, there is a single mesh zipped pocket on the outer material, and a removable Chamber pocket that hangs near the top of the bag.\n   * The interior also sports a generous bladder sleeve that can also be used to contain your laptop. Note that this sleeve is unpadded, so you'll want to have your laptop in a protective sleeve.\n   * On top of the pack, between the grab handle and shoulder straps is another zipped pocket. Kifaru intended this pocket to carry sunglasses, and it does work well for that purpose, but I've also found it is an ideal place for me to store my smartphone, or other small items I want close to my person\n   * On the outer bottom of the pack is a second external zipped pocket. The pocket runs to the bottom of the pack and has a small clip for attaching keys. The backpanel also has four rows of Molle webbing, which can be used to attach any molle compatible pouches or to lash large items to the pack. There is also a bottom grab handle that would be usueful when pulling the back out from overhead bins.\n   * The pack integrates two water bottle pockets, one on each size of the main compartment. These side pockets are deep and easily swallow a wide Nalgene without issue. The Compression straps add another handing feature here, creating the ability for to lash taller items like hiking poles or tripods into the side water pockets.\n   * Finally, the bottom of the pack has 2 buckled straps that can expand to carry a rolled up coat, or to lash large items to the pack. These straps are sewn in to the bag and not removable. This is one of the few downsides to this pack. I would love the ability to remove these straps when I don't need them.\n* Likes\n   * Aesthetics:  \nI really like the clean lines of this pack. Many of the packs I considered were way too military/Tacticool for me. I really like how unassuming the Antero is, especially in Wolf-grey. While the pack does have some Molle, I find the water bottle pockets really distract from the military vibe - bottle pockets are very much associated with civilian uses. Kifaru also tapers the pocket material the entire length of the bag, which I find makes the bottle pockets blend into the pack design much better than the mesh pockets that are attached to most backpacks.\n   * Straps: There seem to be two schools of thought when it comes to backpack straps. Group one goes with heavily padded foam, while group two opts for thin, but wider straps. I've worn both, and I must say I prefer the latter option. Both Hill People Gear and Kifaru seem to use a wider strap that I find disperses the weight more evenly. The heavy foam of the GR1 worked well under load, but felt like over kill when the pack was empty. While we're talking straps - the adjustment buckles on the Kifaru are smooth as butter. For whatever reason, my GR1's buckles were stiff and noisy when adjusting. After the Antero, I could never go back.\n      * Note\\* - I've since moved onto a Hill people gear bag and their harness is much better than the Kifaru - you could even mod this onto the Antero and get best of both worlds.\n   * Size: The bag seems to be a sweet spot in size. It can hold a lot, but isn't get floppy when empty. Kifaru designed the pack to ride close to the body. It really doesn't stick out much when compared to the GR1. Even when full, the Antero has plenty of external carry space. The two water bottle pockets are quite deep and could easily carry a rolled up jacket, a zipped pouch, or even a water bottle (imagine that!). Not too mention the bottom two straps which could hold a huge drybag of stuff if needed. Technically the GR1 had 2 more liters of capacity (26L vs 24L), but I've come to realize how arbitrary estimating bag size can be. In my experience, the Kifaru holds the same amount as the GR1.\n   * Carry: This bag carries like a Dream. The GR1, when empty, felt like overkill, too stiff and rigid for the load. When it was full, I found that it pulled away from shoulders too much and was too heavy for comfort. I find the Antero carries better in both instances - It doesn't feel out of place when nearly empty and hugs my back much better when full.\n* Dislikes:\n   * Sternum strap - This sternum strap has way too much extra webbing. Its insane. You'd have to have a hulk-sized chest for this much webbing to make sense. I'll need to cut that down to size.\n   * Bottom Straps - I wish these were removable. I don't use them often and probably would remove them for daily use if I could.\n* My various loadouts:\n   * One-bag Travel - The Antero, at 24 liters, is plenty big for one-bag travel on its own. If I'm not looking to pack light, I will attach the Grab-it and fill an Ultra-light Pull-out with my extra gear. Omni-belt comes or stays depending on whether or not I will need the load bearing at my destination (Hiking? Bring it. Urban walking and transit-hopping? Leave it)\n   * Day-pack Travel - When I arrive at my destination, I simply need to drop any clothes/gear I don't need for the day and I have a workable daypack. In crowded, theft-prone areas, attach the organizer inside the bag for a stripped-down, secure daypack. Attach the Grab-it if the extra space is needed. Add Omni-belt only if hiking or carrying heavy loads for long distances.\n   * Daily EDC and Commute - Attach the organizer to the outside for quick access. Leave the Omni-belt and Grab-it at home.\n   * Day-hike to Overnight backpacking - Attach organizer inside, Attach Grab-it to outside, attach Omni-belt and 2 medium pouches. Lash sleeping pad or Hammock to the bottom of the pack. the pockets are also deep enough that they resemble the side pockets on Ultralight Backpacks. I can store my tarp or tent rolled up in one, or both of the side pockets.\n* Overall\n   * I really like this bag. The Antero allows me to get rid of a GR1, a GR Bullet 10L and a Tom Bihn Aeronaut 30. The versatility of this pack is pretty amazing, especially with the add-ons. I recognize that its not cheap, but for me, the simplicity of having one bag that can handle multiple tasks well is worth the cost. Not to mention the durability of Cordura and supporting a business that makes all of their gear in the US. I need more time to fully try out each of my use cases in detail, but so far I am really liking this bag.",
