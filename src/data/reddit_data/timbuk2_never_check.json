            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed.

Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week.

            "body": "After six months with the Bellroy Travel Lite Pack, I concluded that it wasn’t made for me. I posted about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/LOaYfyRspM), and I wrote a long review [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/vividnarrative/p/onebagging-with-the-bellroy-lite?r=1p8ruf&amp;utm_medium=ios). I learned two things from the Bellroy experiment: a) my forever bag needs thick shoulder straps that fit correctly on a hungry hippo like me, and b) 35L is the ideal size for me for trips longer than a week. Needless to say, I was excited when I saw the Globerider35 was announced (can we call it the GR? Not like a flirty Grrrr, but maybe GR35? Yes? Alrighty then, moving on).\n\nAs usual, my random commentary and observations:\n\n2: Here’s the GR35 packed with a large and medium packing cube from Osprey, a matador toiletries pouch, and the aersf 6L sling. I like to divide my electronics into two categories, the main being items I might use in transit, e.i. Kindle, phone charger, power bank, etc., and secondary items such as camera charger, power adapter, etc. The main stuff goes to the top for easy access, and the secondary stuff goes further into the pack since I won’t use it until I get to my hotel. In this case, I’ve stuffed my secondary electronics in the zipper pockets to the left. One pocket even has two t-shirts in size XL—the perfect size for my usage.\n\n3: You probably can’t tell, but here in the laptop compartment, I have an iPad with a keyboard and a large magazine. I use a 16-inch MBP for work, and I could easily fit that in there if I needed to.\n\n4/5: Front compartment. There’s not much to say other than I love the size. Perfect for some wet wipes, passports, headphones, etc. Excuse the dog butt.\n\n6/7/8: Did I mention that I love the front compartment? It couldn’t get any easier to access my sling, which holds my goodies for a day out. Having this at the very top allows me to have my essentials through the top pocket without unloading the bag or deep diving. And while I’m at it, I figured I’d show you what I carry in the sling.\n\n9: Reading classes. I would usually have these in a hard case, but I figured I’d try this out. I’m not sure how comfortable I feel about them lying ‘naked,’ but let’s try—who needs vision anyway?\n\n10/11: It looks relatively complete now, but the material has a good amount of give. Notice how I’m able to compress it a fair bit. Does it make a big difference? I doubt it, but I think I could move things around a little more strategically, and that would help a bit if I needed to compress it, I suppose.\n\nOther thoughts/observations from a day in transit:\n\n* Let’s talk price. I can’t lie; I gasped when I saw the price—a $300 backpack, that is. I travel a fair bit, and I want the right pack that can give me a decade of mileage. I have no interest in having a ‘collection of backpacks’ that I might use once a year. Nope, this would be my main bag, so $300 is a reasonable price point for the right bag.\n* This moves into my next part: first impression. I was immediately impressed. The quality and the R&amp;D that went into the bag all clicked, and I forgot the eye-watering price right away. The GR35 made me feel that I got good value for my money, a feeling that I didn’t experience with the Travel Lite Pack.\n* Form: In terms of shape, I find it perfectly balanced; it doesn’t feel sloppy like some UL bags can be, nor does it become a boxy rectangular bag  that sometimes higher-end bags can look like. This is just right.\n* I ended up adding a pair of size 12 Oofo slides to the pack, and it still didn’t feel grossly stuffed. Nice.\n* I’ve walked roughly 4 miles today while in transit and am very impressed. The weight is distributed nicely (notice how I removed the hip belt), and the shoulder straps are comfortable. It does NOT breathe well, but I reckon you’re trading in comfort for breathability, which is perfectly fine with me. Look elsewhere if you are looking for an Osprey-level back paneling.\n\nAnd that’s it folks, happy to answer any questions!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7okp5jshzpe1.jpeg?width=2818&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704272858a0cd7eb82339c7e810130d467e53550",

Well, this really does suit my needs and better. \n\nInside is a D500 with the 200-500 attached with tripod collar and the lens hood attached also. Binoculars, a DX AF-P 70-300, Dji osmo action 3 and other bits to fill it.\nOn the outside is a full size Vanguard tripod and an OEX ultralight stool.\nThe front pouch I’ve not even started on yet but some hand sanitizer and my favourite camera magazines will do for now.\n\nAs I say, this is just to show what this bag is capable of holding and more for anyone thinking about getting one, they are pricey but in my opinion, well worth it 👍🏻",

I actually selected it originally because I had the same exact setup as you, the D500+200-500mm, and I wanted a bag that would fit it in \"shooting condition\". So many bags can only fit that combo with the lens hood reversed and I did not like that. I have since upgraded to the 500PF, and then to a Z8, and I'm happy to report that the Z8+FTZ+1.4TC+500PF+Hood setup fits snugly in the bag too. [Here are a few pics I've taken before](https://imgur.com/a/LyA9dJ2) to show people the capacity, and that's all with just the same general \"layout\" that I like to use, which appears pretty similar to yours. I personally like doing the tripod on the side pocket rather than the front, but that's part of the bag's versatility.\n\nThis is such a good hiking camera bag though, the only downside I could find is that it's not compatible with hydration reservoirs. Enter the [Hardside Hydration Swig Rig](https://www.hardsidehydration.com/products/swig-rig-wide-mouth), which lets you turn a Nalgene bottle into a reservoir so you can drink without taking the pack off. Not trying to sound like a shill but that product was a game changer for me and I just have no interest in any other hiking camera bags now that it has solved my only serious issue. \n\nI do also own the Backlight 36L, which is kind of a beast of a bag and if filled completely with gear becomes too heavy for hiking. I rarely use it, though I may start using it more once I pick up my 800PF. I'm actually considering either the Backlight 18L or the new \"Sprint\" 15L for shorter hikes where I don't really need anything beyond my camera and a water bottle.",

Now I wonder if I should have.  \n\nThe Bellroy has been discussed at length.  It’s a very well thought out backpack with only a few nitpicks.  The best of it for me is that even at 28L, it feels like I could use it as a one bag in a pinch.  The cavernous inside space allows great organization with packing cubes, and most of the other pockets and storage are well thought out, if extremely simple.  \n\nThe Heimplanet is a reverse clamshell.  The back opening is awesome and super well organized with the right pockets and space for laptop and tablet.  However, it sure feels small for the 28L it claims.  Part of that is the interior main space and the way it opens up. \n\nThe front pockets are well organized, but intrude in the main area space when full.  Also, you don’t have the small cellphone pocket that is at the top of the Bellroy. \n\nUltimately, I like the Heimplanet, and could use it as an EDC with limited extended travel. I can see putting my Dopp kit, one medium packing cube and my electronics in there.   I don’t think you could carry an extra set of shoes in there. Likely one change of clothes and a small pocket camera.",

There's still wiggleroom for an extra sweater and some other misc items.\n\n**Bags:**\n\n* 32l Decathlon Quechua NH500: [https://www.decathlon.com/products/hiking-backpack-32l-nh-escape-500-334334?adept-product=hiking-backpack-32l-nh-escape-500-334334&amp;variant=39732256407614&amp;adept\\_product\\_id=hiking-backpack-32l-nh-escape-500-334334&amp;source=search](https://www.decathlon.com/products/hiking-backpack-32l-nh-escape-500-334334?adept-product=hiking-backpack-32l-nh-escape-500-334334&amp;variant=39732256407614&amp;adept_product_id=hiking-backpack-32l-nh-escape-500-334334&amp;source=search)\n* Osprey Sportlite15 ¿? - I pack it inside the bigger bag and use it as a day bag, extremely light yet fits laptop, sweater, bottle of water etc. with a bit of cushioning\n\n**Clothing:**\n\n* 1x Raincoat: decathlon foldable raincoat - also doubles as windbreaker\n* 1x Jacket: uniqlo down jacket\n* 2x Sweater: normal sweater and uniqlo uv parka\n* 2x Long pants\n* 4x Tshirts: uniqlo airism\n* 2x Shorts: gym shorts\n* 5x Underwear: decathlon kalenji technical trunks and socks\n* 1x Swimsuit trunks\n* 1x Microfiber shower towel\n* 1x Shower/beach sandles - 2 sizes smaller than my size to save on space\n* 1x Cotton Pyjama Top and Bottom - can't do without, bought it mid-trip last year\n\n**Tech:**\n\n* 1x Macbook Air\n* 1x Universal charger\n* 3x USB Cables\n* 1x Set of usb adaptors\n\n**Toileteries**\n\n* 1x Ziplock bag with the usual suspects\n* 1x Ziplock bag with phillips one blade and trimming stuff\n* 1x Ziplock bag with medicine/first aid\n\n**Others:**\n\n* 1x Lock: Abus Titanium with code\n* 1x Umbrella: Decathlon Micro Umbrella\n* 1x Clothing Rope: from decathlon to hang wet clothes\n* 1x Belt which also acts as strap to tighten my backpack if necessary\n* 1x Running belt with plenty pockets for phone, cards, passport etc.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything around items, the bag itself, the trips etc. Last year I did from europe to australia, across india, china, japan and the usual SEAsia itinerary.

I really appreciate the suggestions for Tom Bihn, but they are far too similar to either a book bag for a high school kid, or b) some corporate bag that a Fortune 500 company would brand and then give out to employees. Same with SwissGear or packs like that. Similarly, Mystery Ranch is too tactical to provide some more context on this. For example, \n* Preferably some amount of style and color beyond a pure-black backpack, but considering the market it’s looking like I may need to go all black and then stylize it myself. \n* For example, I really like the extra pop of color in this Timbuk2 Tuck bag: [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2572/9458/products/timbuk2-tuck-laptop-backpack-eco-gunmetal-pop-1029-3-1149-on-body-male-1\\_5\\_x2680.progressive.png.jpg?v=1662508963](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2572/9458/products/timbuk2-tuck-laptop-backpack-eco-gunmetal-pop-1029-3-1149-on-body-male-1_5_x2680.progressive.png.jpg?v=1662508963) but I don’t want a roll-top. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Materials**\n\n* Not leather, ideally 400+ cordura nylon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Features**\n\n* Clamshell: ideally full clamshell, but half or 3/4 is okay too. \n* Comfortable harness system. \n* No waist harness. \n* No “expandable” option. I don’t need extra weight, and I’m also an r/manybaggers so I don’t have the need to purchase one bag that is somehow expected to do everything. I’m buying this for short weekend trips and daily carry— that’s all. No gym clothes or one-bag 9 day Europe trips or anything. \n* No external water bottle holders, though this isn’t a dealbreaker — I can deal with them if I everything else is a good fit.  \n* No compression straps\n* Waterproof / water resistant bottom\n* Great organization. I don’t need zippers that open up the main compartment from every angle like many photographer backpacks though, I’m searching for a balance between simplicity and organization. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a very solid list of the daily backpacks that are in consideration here, but none of them QUITE fit the bill, so I was hoping that this squadron of internet sleuths could help me track down the ultimate bag:  [https://airtable.com/shrhzTKAcytjfkux6](https://airtable.com/shrhzTKAcytjfkux6)",

I've never had a luggage bag falling apart so quickly. \n\nWhat about the so called lifetime warranty, you ask? Well, first, it is \"limited\" warranty only for manufacturing defect. The quote for fixing this damage is $35. Second, I have to pay for shipping, which is about $50 via FeDex or UPS. Why would I effectively pay $85 to repair a bag with such a design flaw that it falls apart after two uses...",

And one winter _(Canada)_ one of the buckle-clips just **shattered** upon regular use - it was indeed cold as it was winter and I had waited for a bus for 20-30 minutes or so, but I was surprised at how fragile the buckles were, it wasn't -30°C or whatever ahahah so it wasn't _extreme cold_ - **EDIT** - I believe the model was the [**TIMBUK2 Classic Messenger Bag**](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5025-689/classic-messenger-bag) - it was bought in store so no online trace, but it looks like it\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I also had a smaller messenger bag from TIMBUK2 and same issues with the velcro, and a new issue too - the velcro stitching was getting undone within a year of use, but _also,_ the ''soft'' velcro side was quickly loosing its ''hookness'' - it wouldn't stick, it became a tangled fabric mess that wouldn't hold anymore - **EDIT** - Found an old online receipt, this one was the [**Timbuk2 Catapult Messenger Bag**](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5031-193)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI always thought they had interesting designs, but based on my 2 bad experiences with quality, I never bought from them again, and I often see TIMBUK2-related threads within this community and elsewhere, so it isn't a one-time thing, it seems to be quite prevalent!",

I saw a Timbuk2 store when walking around in SF and decided to check it out since it's a reputable brand. I only bought the luggage because the sales person assured me of the \"lifetime warranty\". I should have checked reddit before making the purchase. \n\nThe cost of the luggage is not that big of a deal, I just feel very much cheated for making such a stupid purchase. The damage may not affect its use, but I travel in business settings and don't want to use bags with visible damages. \n\nI explained all of this to the customer service rep Arielle. At first she said \"yes totally we need to replace it since it's so new.\" But after she heard back from the warranty department that Timbuk2 wouldn't cover the repair cost or shipping, she changed her tone and said \"nothing we could do, it's not manufacturing defect, the base isn't falling off\".\n\nI've ordered a Briggs&amp;Riley baseline.

        "selftext": "It's the age old question, isn't it? How much organization is just right (for me)? I guess there's no right or wrong answer here - really boils down to personal preference.  \n\nUp until now I've been traveling with top-loading backpacks (either a ~35 liter Timbuk2, or the REI Flash 22). A few weeks ago I got a deal I couldn't refuse on a Timbuk2 Never Check duffel backpack, the ~36 liter one, so I just bought it without any research or consideration. Luckily, it seems [reviewers like it](https://www.carryology.com/luggage/timbuk2-never-check-backpack-duffel-review-drive-by/) [just fine](https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/timbuk2/never-check-backpack-duffel/).  \n\nI just came back from 4 days in Seattle. For this summer trip, my wife and I had packed in our own 22-26 liter backpacks, but since I picked up the Never Check, I carried everything for the two of us. Thoughts after coming back:  \n\nPros:  \n\n* This thing is _capacious_! It holds a lot!\n* Very high quality, the materials, components, design, all feel top notch.\n* Comfortable carry in backpack mode\n* Soft design easy to squash into crowded overhead. On the way back I even managed to fit it under the seat in front of me..  \n\nCons:  \n\n* When loaded the bag hangs at a weird angle (top out away from the back, bottom in the small of my back). Not particularly uncomfortable for walking airport-to-transit, or transit-home. But it looks daft. I think the straps are mounted too low on the bag. Or it needs load lifters. Or something...\n* Buckles covering tech pocket are a PITA - they appear to serve no function, and are irritating to undo to get into the pocket.\n* No external water bottle pocket\n* No convenient small pocket for keys/phone/boarding pass\n* Too many pockets, and not really in the right places    \n\nNone of these are a big deal, but I'm left feeling ambivalent about the bag. Objectively - it's a high quality bag that I got at a great price, and it would serve pretty well. On the other hand - I missed the simplicity and carry of my top-loading packs, and I'm left wondering if maybe the full front zipper (Fjallraven Kanken style, though bigger) backpack would be the Holy Grail that combines the best of all worlds..?  \n\nWhat would you do?",

Slightly more organization and it might have been perfect...",

I picked up a used Synapse 25 off eBay to try it out and was really impressed by the quality. Once you're hooked there are lots of material and color way choices so that is where people really get into the brand.\n\nEdit: I also think they are sort of a non-tactical Goruck in that they offer a lot of o-ring attachment points for different accessories.",

(I find my synapse lays as flat and streamlined to my back as any other backpack, so don’t really give credence to that critique, but it is a prevalent one). \n\nIt’s the exact same form factor as Aer and Evergoods, and very similar to goruck as well. Just a big boxy rectangle, but that seems to be well regarded among bag dudes. Of course, the texture of the nylon ballistic fabric and prominent zippers detract from some of that aesthetic. If they made this in 400d halcyon, it would be a completely different (and better looking, imo) bag. But that would require being able to source the fabric ",

The layout is not very functional and ill-conceived as it doesn't look like it accommodates their existing ecosystem very well. To me, it looks like an Aer or AON rip off but less well executed. The water bottle pocket on the outside looks like it will let bottles slip, and there is no false bottom or padding on the laptop compartment according to reviews. \n\nAlso the product video is half finished - the music cuts off half way through, the water bottle is leaking, and the product description isn't accurate. Basic things they should get right when they are charging the prices they are!",

I own something like 7 of their bags and numerous organizational pouches. \n\nUnfortunately, by most accounts, what everyone expected would happen once they were bought by a PE firm is happening. I haven’t bought anything from them in years but on the TB sub there are many complaints of simplifying stitching, removing lining etc. in essence trying to make bags cheaper to pump up profits. Again, no first hand knowledge but this absolutely tracks when a foreign PE firm with zero bag experience comes in and replaces the management team. It was sad to see the non business savvy fans of the brand swearing nothing would change. \n\nThis to me marks the beginning of the end of what used to be TB. Somehow they managed to make a generic bag completely devoid of all TB dna… but still make it terribly ugly. \n\nWith their plan to open a retail location and constant complaints of inventory availability I have a feeling they are setting up to push a lot of production overseas. (Just my theory). They will do what Goruck did and explain that there is simply no way to meet demand and maintain profitability by producing everything in the USA. Maybe their flagship bags will still be made in Washington but I doubt their will long term continue making pouches and accessories there. If CTactical has taught us anything, it’s that you can make extremely nice bags in Vietnam for a third of what some of their big brands charge.",
