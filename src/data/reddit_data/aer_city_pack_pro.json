        "selftext": "I recently picked the Aer City Pack Pro (X-Pac) and Pro Pack 24L to compare (I’m only going to keep one). Here’s a quick review - feel free to ask any questions about these bags.\n\nBackground + Usage\nMy current travel bag is the Bellroy Transit backpack (28L). I’ve been able to pack for a short weekend trip to a 7 days, and it’s been my favorite bag. However, at 28L it’s just a little too big to EDC once I get to the destination. \n\nI stay in hotels/AirBNBs (no hostels), and my traveling is primarily urban environments (so I’m not typically doing a lot of outdoor activities, such as camping, hiking, etc.).\n\n24L seems like a good size for shorter trips, and I was intrigued by the Aer CPP and PP 24L, which seem very similar (more on that later).\n\nCapacity\nAs they’re both 24L, I used the same load out:\n\n- Large Minaal packing cube\n- Purevave toiletry kit - a less expensive version of the Nomatic/Gravel toiletry bags\n- Ulanzi tech organizer - one of the smallest tech kits I could find\n- Hoodie (not pictured)\n\nEverything fit in both bags without any struggle.\n\nFit\nI saw a post here that mentioned the PP’s straps were narrower than the CPP, and the Pack Hacker review also mentioned this. The PP is indeed narrower, but I really couldn’t tell much difference in fit between the two; for reference, I’, 5’10” and 150 pounds.\n\nMaterials\nI really like the new material of the CPP - it reminds me of the material on my Bellroy Transit; I should note my Bellroy is one of the early production runs, before they changed the materials slightly (at least for the black color way).\n\nThat being said, I’ve always been a fan of X-PAC, and I don’t find it overly crinkly or noisy. All of the zippers on the CPP are Aquaguard, whereas on the CPP only the laptop zipper is an Aquaguard.\n\nThe Aquaguard zippers are a little stiff to open, I hope they’ll loosen up over time. On the CPP’s front there’s a hypalon tab on the left side to hold onto as you open the horizontal zipper, but I wish they added tabs to the bottom that you can hold onto when you open the main clamshell compartment; however, the PP has tabs on the bottom.\n\nI’ve also read conflicting posts around the web; some claim X-PAC is highly abrasive on wool, and some claim that high denier ballistic nylon is also rough on wool. I’ve never had an issue with either materials, and the only part of the backpack that touches clothing are the straps and back panel, which are foam padded, so it seems like a moot issue.\n\nOther Notes\nThe CPP has a traditional dump pocket at the top (for glasses, keys, etc.), whereas the PP has a new pocket they call a “valet pocket”. I was able to fit all my tech that I would normally keep in the Ulanzi in the valet pocket, which means I could potentially leave the tech organizer at home (and potentially free up a little space in the main compartment).\n\nThe Pack hacker review mentioned that the material in the valet pocket was folder over, and it might lose structure over time, so something to keep in mind.\n\nA few other differences:\n\n- the PP has two water bottle pockets, the CPP has one (with a zipper compartment on the other side)\n- the PP has handles on all sides, whereas the CPP only has the top handle\n\n\nThe One I’m Keeping\nThey’re both nice bags, but I think I’m keeping the CPP for these reasons:\n\n- better organization: I like the horizontal front pocket\n- I only need one water bottle pocket, and can utilize the side pocket\n- the valet pocket instead of the dump pocket is nice, but not enough to put the PP over the top\n- although the narrower straps on the PP didn’t really make it a deal breaker,, the CPP felt slightly more comfortable\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThese bags are obviously very similar, with a lot of functional overlap. I would love to see a bastard love child of these two bags with these features:\n\n- CPP with the PP’s materials\n- CPP with handles on the side\n- CPP with tabs on the bottom\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know and I’ll try to answer them.",

However, at 28L it’s just a little too big to EDC once I get to the destination. \n\nI stay in hotels/AirBNBs (no hostels), and my traveling is primarily urban environments (so I’m not typically doing a lot of outdoor activities, such as camping, hiking, etc.).\n\n24L seems like a good size for shorter trips, and I was intrigued by the Aer CPP and PP 24L, which seem very similar (more on that later).\n\nCapacity\nAs they’re both 24L, I used the same load out:\n\n- Large Minaal packing cube\n- Purevave toiletry kit - a less expensive version of the Nomatic/Gravel toiletry bags\n- Ulanzi tech organizer - one of the smallest tech kits I could find\n- Hoodie (not pictured)\n\nEverything fit in both bags without any struggle.\n\nFit\nI saw a post here that mentioned the PP’s straps were narrower than the CPP, and the Pack Hacker review also mentioned this. The PP is indeed narrower, but I really couldn’t tell much difference in fit between the two; for reference, I’, 5’10” and 150 pounds.\n\nMaterials\nI really like the new material of the CPP - it reminds me of the material on my Bellroy Transit; I should note my Bellroy is one of the early production runs, before they changed the materials slightly (at least for the black color way).\n\nThat being said, I’ve always been a fan of X-PAC, and I don’t find it overly crinkly or noisy. All of the zippers on the CPP are Aquaguard, whereas on the CPP only the laptop zipper is an Aquaguard.\n\nThe Aquaguard zippers are a little stiff to open, I hope they’ll loosen up over time. On the CPP’s front there’s a hypalon tab on the left side to hold onto as you open the horizontal zipper, but I wish they added tabs to the bottom that you can hold onto when you open the main clamshell compartment; however, the PP has tabs on the bottom.\n\nI’ve also read conflicting posts around the web; some claim X-PAC is highly abrasive on wool, and some claim that high denier ballistic nylon is also rough on wool. I’ve never had an issue with either materials, and the only part of the backpack that touches clothing are the straps and back panel, which are foam padded, so it seems like a moot issue.\n\nOther Notes\nThe CPP has a traditional dump pocket at the top (for glasses, keys, etc.), whereas the PP has a new pocket they call a “valet pocket”. I was able to fit all my tech that I would normally keep in the Ulanzi in the valet pocket, which means I could potentially leave the tech organizer at home (and potentially free up a little space in the main compartment).\n\nThe Pack hacker review mentioned that the material in the valet pocket was folder over, and it might lose structure over time, so something to keep in mind.\n\nA few other differences:\n\n- the PP has two water bottle pockets, the CPP has one (with a zipper compartment on the other side)\n- the PP has handles on all sides, whereas the CPP only has the top handle\n\n\nThe One I’m Keeping\nThey’re both nice bags, but I think I’m keeping the CPP for these reasons:\n\n- better organization: I like the horizontal front pocket\n- I only need one water bottle pocket, and can utilize the side pocket\n- the valet pocket instead of the dump pocket is nice, but not enough to put the PP over the top\n- although the narrower straps on the PP didn’t really make it a deal breaker,, the CPP felt slightly more comfortable\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThese bags are obviously very similar, with a lot of functional overlap. I would love to see a bastard love child of these two bags with these features:\n\n- CPP with the PP’s materials\n- CPP with handles on the side\n- CPP with tabs on the bottom\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know and I’ll try to answer them.",

        "selftext": "I recently picked the Aer City Pack Pro (X-Pac) and Pro Pack 24L to compare (I’m only going to keep one). Here’s a quick review - feel free to ask any questions about these bags.\n\nBackground + Usage\nMy current travel bag is the Bellroy Transit backpack (28L). I’ve been able to pack for a short weekend trip to a 7 days, and it’s been my favorite bag. However, at 28L it’s just a little too big to EDC once I get to the destination. \n\nI stay in hotels/AirBNBs (no hostels), and my traveling is primarily urban environments (so I’m not typically doing a lot of outdoor activities, such as camping, hiking, etc.).\n\n24L seems like a good size for shorter trips, and I was intrigued by the Aer CPP and PP 24L, which seem very similar (more on that later).\n\nCapacity\nAs they’re both 24L, I used the same load out:\n\n- Large Minaal packing cube\n- Purevave toiletry kit - a less expensive version of the Nomatic/Gravel toiletry bags\n- Ulanzi tech organizer - one of the smallest tech kits I could find\n- Hoodie (not pictured)\n\nEverything fit in both bags without any struggle.\n\nFit\nI saw a post here that mentioned the PP’s straps were narrower than the CPP, and the Pack Hacker review also mentioned this. The PP is indeed narrower, but I really couldn’t tell much difference in fit between the two; for reference, I’, 5’10” and 150 pounds.\n\nMaterials\nI really like the new material of the CPP - it reminds me of the material on my Bellroy Transit; I should note my Bellroy is one of the early production runs, before they changed the materials slightly (at least for the black color way).\n\nThat being said, I’ve always been a fan of X-PAC, and I don’t find it overly crinkly or noisy. All of the zippers on the CPP are Aquaguard, whereas on the CPP only the laptop zipper is an Aquaguard.\n\nThe Aquaguard zippers are a little stiff to open, I hope they’ll loosen up over time. On the CPP’s front there’s a hypalon tab on the left side to hold onto as you open the horizontal zipper, but I wish they added tabs to the bottom that you can hold onto when you open the main clamshell compartment; however, the PP has tabs on the bottom.\n\nI’ve also read conflicting posts around the web; some claim X-PAC is highly abrasive on wool, and some claim that high denier ballistic nylon is also rough on wool. I’ve never had an issue with either materials, and the only part of the backpack that touches clothing are the straps and back panel, which are foam padded, so it seems like a moot issue.\n\nOther Notes\nThe CPP has a traditional dump pocket at the top (for glasses, keys, etc.), whereas the PP has a new pocket they call a “valet pocket”. I was able to fit all my tech that I would normally keep in the Ulanzi in the valet pocket, which means I could potentially leave the tech organizer at home (and potentially free up a little space in the main compartment).\n\nThe Pack hacker review mentioned that the material in the valet pocket was folder over, and it might lose structure over time, so something to keep in mind.\n\nA few other differences:\n\n- the PP has two water bottle pockets, the CPP has one (with a zipper compartment on the other side)\n- the PP has handles on all sides, whereas the CPP only has the top handle\n\n\nThe One I’m Keeping\nThey’re both nice bags, but I think I’m keeping the CPP for these reasons:\n\n- better organization: I like the horizontal front pocket\n- I only need one water bottle pocket, and can utilize the side pocket\n- the valet pocket instead of the dump pocket is nice, but not enough to put the PP over the top\n- although the narrower straps on the PP didn’t really make it a deal breaker,, the CPP felt slightly more comfortable\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThese bags are obviously very similar, with a lot of functional overlap. I would love to see a bastard love child of these two bags with these features:\n\n- CPP with the PP’s materials\n- CPP with handles on the side\n- CPP with tabs on the bottom\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know and I’ll try to answer them.",

He’s not on here, but check out [The Perfect Bag](https://youtube.com/@ThePerfectBag) on YouTube. \n\nFirst impressions below:\n\nPLC 20 was always something I wanted to check out, but I could never pull the trigger due to the lack of an external water bottle and luggage pass-through. After traveling quite a bit by plane pre-Covid, I had a mindset that these are must-haves. \n\nA lot has changed since then, though. I drive to work now rather than take public transit, so the quick access to a water bottle isn’t a huge deal, as I can have another bottle in the car. I also haven’t flown much at all now that I’m a dad to a 15-month-old. Therefore, I won this bag at a perfect time in my life to reassess my assumptions of what my needs are in a bag. \n\nPros:\n- It’s quite slimmer and smaller than the CPP overall\n- I can pack everything I had for daily carry with some adjustments (see cons below) and still have room to spare (see pics)\n- I like the front dump pocket more than I thought I would. The simplicity of putting my sunglasses, flashlights, small tripod, etc., in one pocket rather than having to open several zippers was more appealing to me than I had expected. \n\nCons:\n- No strap keepers. It’s such a simple thing not to include, especially as other Evergoods bags have them. \n- I had to add another pouch for my random items that I throw in the bottom front pocket of the Aer bag as I didn’t want these small items to get lost in bag dump areas. Not a big deal, but this is a trade-off for the simplicity of the bag. \n- No dedicated laptop compartment. This is especially a big deal for me as I didn’t like the weight distribution of having the water bottle in the front pocket (which means I’m carrying a bottle of water in the same compartment as my laptop) \n\nI’m going to try it out for a couple of weeks.

After traveling quite a bit by plane pre-Covid, I had a mindset that these are must-haves. \n\nA lot has changed since then, though.

The simplicity of putting my sunglasses, flashlights, small tripod, etc., in one pocket rather than having to open several zippers was more appealing to me than I had expected. \n\nCons:\n- No strap keepers.

Not a big deal, but this is a trade-off for the simplicity of the bag. \n- No dedicated laptop compartment. This is especially a big deal for me as I didn’t like the weight distribution of having the water bottle in the front pocket (which means I’m carrying a bottle of water in the same compartment as my laptop) \n\nI’m going to try it out for a couple of weeks.

It might be the best purchase I made in 2022!\n\nFirst impressions:\n- it’s incredibly light weight especially for its size \n- stands on its own (I have a somewhat heavy tech pouch at the bottom)\n- x-pac not as noisy or shiny as I feared\n- the interior is smaller than I had expected as water bottle takes up part of the interior room\n- orange inside is really nice!\n- the bag is bigger than I’m used to carrying, but not overly large (I’m 5’7 for reference) \n- it looks much bigger if you stuff up the top front admin area, but it looks average if you only put flat items there\n- still deciding whether to keep it or get it in olive\n\nQuick update 10/26/2022: \n\n- I used it for work yesterday and felt that it was a bit bulky for my needs (I only ended up filling less than half of the main compartment. \n- While I like the idea of the extra space for when I need it, I’m not sure if I want the extra bulk for 90% of the time I won’t need it. \n- [Wander EDC’s Comparison Video](https://youtu.be/dF-hIf2i1n0) made it clear to me that the non-pro may need my needs the vast majority of the time.  \n- I had initially thought the regular city pack would be smaller due to its 14L capacity, but based on the side-by-side views and listed dimensions, I’m not convinced that it’s a true 14L bag.  It’s probably closer to 16-18L. [Danny Packs also mentioned this in his review.](https://youtu.be/fFSqImzunkw)\n- With the listed dimensions, non-pro CP should allow me to put my drone kit and a small packing cube in the main compartment for flights (we’ll see). \n- Also, the better tech admin panel on the non-pro might allow me to eliminate my tech pouch (freeing up some space to make up for the loss of liters)\n\nLong story short:\n- I decided to order the non-pro just now and hoping it’ll get here before my return period ends for the pro so I can compare. \n- I still might keep the CPP, but I want to see if I should go with the regular City Pack and pack a shopping bag or something for those rare occasions when I need it. \n- Will update everyone on what I decide next week!",

[Pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/jnuPd2V)\n\n- I decided that I would never use it this packed, and started the return process (holding on until I get the regular CP on Wednesday to be sure)\n\n- [Wander EDC’s Comparison Video](https://youtu.be/dF-hIf2i1n0) was super helpful in helping me choose. \n\n- For weekend trips, I can just use my Patagonia Chacabuco 30L as it can hold just as much and I don’t mind getting it dirty either (CPP was going to be my work pack primarily)\n\n- My regular City Pack in X-Pac is coming next week. I think I will love it since I really like everything about the CPP, I just wish it didn’t stick out so much. \n\n- In a perfect world, I would make the middle part of CPP about 1.5 inches shorter and the front panel would mimic regular city pack.",

            "body": "Final TLDR update (full story below and in replies) 12/30/22: [decided to keep it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ykp0k8/aer_city_pack_and_city_pack_pro_sidebyside/iuwwpps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) and very happy with my purchase. It might be the best purchase I made in 2022!\n\nFirst impressions:\n- it’s incredibly light weight especially for its size \n- stands on its own (I have a somewhat heavy tech pouch at the bottom)\n- x-pac not as noisy or shiny as I feared\n- the interior is smaller than I had expected as water bottle takes up part of the interior room\n- orange inside is really nice!\n- the bag is bigger than I’m used to carrying, but not overly large (I’m 5’7 for reference) \n- it looks much bigger if you stuff up the top front admin area, but it looks average if you only put flat items there\n- still deciding whether to keep it or get it in olive\n\nQuick update 10/26/2022: \n\n- I used it for work yesterday and felt that it was a bit bulky for my needs (I only ended up filling less than half of the main compartment. \n- While I like the idea of the extra space for when I need it, I’m not sure if I want the extra bulk for 90% of the time I won’t need it. \n- [Wander EDC’s Comparison Video](https://youtu.be/dF-hIf2i1n0) made it clear to me that the non-pro may need my needs the vast majority of the time.  \n- I had initially thought the regular city pack would be smaller due to its 14L capacity, but based on the side-by-side views and listed dimensions, I’m not convinced that it’s a true 14L bag.  It’s probably closer to 16-18L. [Danny Packs also mentioned this in his review.](https://youtu.be/fFSqImzunkw)\n- With the listed dimensions, non-pro CP should allow me to put my drone kit and a small packing cube in the main compartment for flights (we’ll see). \n- Also, the better tech admin panel on the non-pro might allow me to eliminate my tech pouch (freeing up some space to make up for the loss of liters)\n\nLong story short:\n- I decided to order the non-pro just now and hoping it’ll get here before my return period ends for the pro so I can compare. \n- I still might keep the CPP, but I want to see if I should go with the regular City Pack and pack a shopping bag or something for those rare occasions when I need it. \n- Will update everyone on what I decide next week!",

                "body": "Update 10/27/2022:\n\n- I tried packing it full to see if I would ever need that use case. [Pictures here](https://imgur.com/a/jnuPd2V)\n\n- I decided that I would never use it this packed, and started the return process (holding on until I get the regular CP on Wednesday to be sure)\n\n- [Wander EDC’s Comparison Video](https://youtu.be/dF-hIf2i1n0) was super helpful in helping me choose. \n\n- For weekend trips, I can just use my Patagonia Chacabuco 30L as it can hold just as much and I don’t mind getting it dirty either (CPP was going to be my work pack primarily)\n\n- My regular City Pack in X-Pac is coming next week. I think I will love it since I really like everything about the CPP, I just wish it didn’t stick out so much. \n\n- In a perfect world, I would make the middle part of CPP about 1.5 inches shorter and the front panel would mimic regular city pack.",

I also have a Patagonia Chacabuco that’s pretty flimsy when not filled out (excellent way to get extra space as a personal item on flights). \n\nI guess this is the trade off of getting a larger EDC bag with some structure that gives me a bit extra space.  The Everki allows me to carry a T-shirt and shorts after my EDC carry load, CPP basically allows me to use it as a weekender since it gives me space for a medium-large packing cube, small Dopp kit, and collapsible/flat shoes in addition to my EDC items.",

        "selftext": "Happy holidays everyone. 🎄🥰\n\nI’ve been in the market for a new pack for a while now and thanks to this sub I narrowed it down to this beauty. Can’t wait to take it for a spin. \n\nI was torn between a number of similar packs: \n\n* Fjallraven Raven\n* Fjallraven Skule\n* Osprey Nebula\n* AER Go pack \n* + some more I can’t remember off the top of my head. \n\nI went with the AER due to its more subdued and professional look (it’s about time I had a proper ‘work’ pack). I also love the fact that it has so many storage and quick access options. \n\nI own a Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21l, which has great reviews, but I really did not get on with it. The access is terrible (I like to rip into a pack to grab things, like my bottle, and the Urban Assualt did not allow for this) and it was too long for my body. When taking it off to put on my chest in trains (something I do a lot in crowded trains), the hard plastic would dig under my chin.\n\nMy fave pack that the AER will be replacing is my trusty and honestly best EDC pack up until now: the **Freitag Hazzard**. An absolutely phenomenal pack imo. I’ve used it almost daily since 2016 and it still holds up well. If you. An afford one and like the look, get one (again, imho).\n\nI’ll clock in again with a field report of the AER in a couple of months. \n\nUntil then! 👋",

But, in all honesty, it was a *bit* too small, so the AER with its larger capacity will, I hope, allow me to travel with less restrictions. Now, why I didn't go for the travel pack is because I want to use the AER as an EDC pack, too. (Basically, I'm looking for the goldilocks zone between \\[not too big for daily use\\] and \\[not too small that I need to take a suitcase too\\])\n\nAnd yes, the look of the bag is what grabbed me too. Going forward, I think this is the professional, EDC pack I want in my life. The Hazzard will definitely be seeing some use though. Like I said, I really like that pack).",

                "body": "So for the same load, it has the CPP around 2/3 full and just small flat items in the admin pockets. \n\n- Surprisingly, CPP feels lighter. It’s because CP gets very stiff when fully packed. The bulk of the items starts to stench out the back panel, reducing the contact surface area between your back and the backpack. CPP has plenty of room to spare, so your whole back carries the weight. I hope this makes sense. \n\n- yes, the internal org, for daily carry purposes, is far superior in CP, in my opinion. It’s because CPP basically only has one pocket and a zipper pocket in the admin panel, with a large drop pocket making up the rest of the space.  If you don’t want it to look bulky, you can’t put much stuff in the CPP admin panel, either.  Meanwhile, you get four small pockets, a pens pocket, one mesh pocket, a zipper pocket, a large flat pocket, and a general drop pocket just in the admin area since it stretches all the way to the bottom. CPP does have two more pockets in the storage compartment, but they are a bit out of reach for daily carry items. \n\n- when CP is packed out, you must remove some items to access the laptop. Therefore, CPP’s separate compartment makes it much easier to access at the cost of added bulk. \n\n- I would love a mash-up of the two bags, honestly. The front panel of CP, separate laptop access of CPP, and maybe 1.5 inch reduction in the middle area of CPP. \n\n- For daily carry use with just light items, CP is far superior. You have enough room for a laptop, a tablet and all tech gear can be stored in the admin panel, eliminating the need for a tech pouch. You still have some space for a light jacket, a pouch, and umbrella or gym clothes (not shoes unless they’re are flat) in the main area. \n- You can actually fit a fully packed medium size packing cube in the CP (what I had in these pics), but it’ll stuff it up and make it feel heavy, as described above. \n- If you need to carry anything extra such as shoes, a lunch box, a thick jacket or hoodie, or packing cubes packed with clothes for light travel, CPP is a better choice. \n- CPP is best used around 2/3 full as it can get unwieldy beyond that for day to day use. \n- So here’s the gist, you can pack the CP as much as you could pack a CPP 2/3 full (optimal amount to keep it manageable.) CPP can handle the volume better but will need a tech pouch to keep things organized.  CP can handle it, too but at the cost of making the whole bag stiff. \n- So you should go with CP if you rarely need to pack it out (it’ll fit likely), but go with CPP if your daily carry needs include things like gym shoes,  thick hoodie/jacket, DSLR, or similarly bulky items.",

It’s because CPP basically only has one pocket and a zipper pocket in the admin panel, with a large drop pocket making up the rest of the space.  If you don’t want it to look bulky, you can’t put much stuff in the CPP admin panel, either.  Meanwhile, you get four small pockets, a pens pocket, one mesh pocket, a zipper pocket, a large flat pocket, and a general drop pocket just in the admin area since it stretches all the way to the bottom. CPP does have two more pockets in the storage compartment, but they are a bit out of reach for daily carry items. \n\n- when CP is packed out, you must remove some items to access the laptop. Therefore, CPP’s separate compartment makes it much easier to access at the cost of added bulk. \n\n- I would love a mash-up of the two bags, honestly. The front panel of CP, separate laptop access of CPP, and maybe 1.5 inch reduction in the middle area of CPP. \n\n- For daily carry use with just light items, CP is far superior. You have enough room for a laptop, a tablet and all tech gear can be stored in the admin panel, eliminating the need for a tech pouch. You still have some space for a light jacket, a pouch, and umbrella or gym clothes (not shoes unless they’re are flat) in the main area. \n- You can actually fit a fully packed medium size packing cube in the CP (what I had in these pics), but it’ll stuff it up and make it feel heavy, as described above. \n- If you need to carry anything extra such as shoes, a lunch box, a thick jacket or hoodie, or packing cubes packed with clothes for light travel, CPP is a better choice. \n- CPP is best used around 2/3 full as it can get unwieldy beyond that for day to day use. \n- So here’s the gist, you can pack the CP as much as you could pack a CPP 2/3 full (optimal amount to keep it manageable.) CPP can handle the volume better but will need a tech pouch to keep things organized.  CP can handle it, too but at the cost of making the whole bag stiff. \n- So you should go with CP if you rarely need to pack it out (it’ll fit likely), but go with CPP if your daily carry needs include things like gym shoes,  thick hoodie/jacket, DSLR, or similarly bulky items.",

I decided to buy both the City Pack and [City Pack Pro in XPac.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ycqi8x/aer_city_pack_pro_xpac_impressions_and_pics/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). \n\nHere are some side-by-side comparisons. Some thoughts:\n\n- both are nearly identical in size once City Pack is fully packed out and pro is filled with the same content (about 2/3 full since it has more capacity)\n- the smaller City Pack is definitely sleeker looking of the two with my EDC items\n- CPP can fit a lot more and could be useful as my light travel bag (would work for week long trip to warm destinations that won’t require bulky clothes)\n- CPP can look bulkier once you start putting things in the front top panel pocket. \n- water bottle can get in the way of City Pack zipper operations (not an issue on the CPP since the zippers don’t end at the bottle pocket)\n- I need to return one and now it’s about looks vs. versatility (can’t decide!)\n\n\n[added some more details in a reply to someone here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ykp0k8/aer_city_pack_and_city_pack_pro_sidebyside/iuv1yra/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)",

                "body": "Update 11/3/22 -\nDecided to return the smaller City Pack. My rationale:\n\n- While CP has better organization, it’s still isn’t enough for me to not use a separate tech pouch\n- CPP is roughly the same size as CP using the same daily load, but it gives me the option to load it up for trips. \n- CPP’s clamshell makes it easier to get at things that can end up at the bottom while traveling. \n- CPP feels lighter on my back when 2/3 full. CP can carry the same content, but it stretches the limit of the fabric and result in less surface area of the back panel touching my back. This makes CP feel heavier with max load. \n- In summary, both meet my EDC needs and even to be used as a personal item for flights.  CPP just gives me a bit extra room with the small sacrifice of not looking as sleek as CP. CPP is still a great looking bag!",

And wow, olive green is a fantastic colorway.\n\nOriginally, i had thought about attaching some paracord or some leftover Gravel branded rubber pulls in yellow or orange for a contrast color but there's no need! Didnt want to detract from the sweet color. Their website pics do not do this justice. Not as drab as a true military olive but slight sheen of the 1680D makes it a bit more vivid and richer in hand. Cordura knocking this color outta the park.\n\nExternally, its thankfully not as boxy as their bags can seem. Its got a slight flattened eggshell shape, which I really like. Best of all, the flat bottom does allow the bag to easily stand on its own.\n\nOn body, with my usual office load out, it does feel heavier than my Evergoods PLC20. Their implementation of Aer's version of the back yoke just doesnt feel as hugging or \"attached\" to my body as Evergood bags, who's design i much prefer. But the carry is quite comfortable, and the burly straps are wonderful. The back mesh is acceptable. It does grab the back of my shirt.\n\nThe amount of internal space doesn't feel as oversized as some seem to describe. And i can imagine this not nearly as big feeling as the Travel Pack Small, and don't think they're in the same league in terms of internal packing space. If anything, feels about the same as my Evergoods CHZ22. I can comfortably fit my small and medium Eagle Creek Spector packing cubes for quick weekend trip.\n\nOne thing to note that I havent really seen mentioned are the nylon straps that attach the straps to the body: their width is much thinner, measuring 3/4” vs the usual 1” on most bags! See 3rd slide. They're about the same width as most sternum straps. At first, kinda stunned me at how thin they looked but after a few days, didnt feel any less secure than usual width'd straps.\n\nAlso, I'm finding the main compartment's flap pocket really unnecessary. I just don't know what its use? Wish the main compartment was just an empty bucket with nothing there but glorious space.\n\nOther than the little niggles, I really like this bag. I wanted something slightly larger than my regular daily carry for those days I'll be carrying some extra gear, and this guy does it nicely.\n\nMore to come!",

            "body": "Just received this beauty. And wow, olive green is a fantastic colorway.\n\nOriginally, i had thought about attaching some paracord or some leftover Gravel branded rubber pulls in yellow or orange for a contrast color but there's no need! Didnt want to detract from the sweet color. Their website pics do not do this justice. Not as drab as a true military olive but slight sheen of the 1680D makes it a bit more vivid and richer in hand. Cordura knocking this color outta the park.\n\nExternally, its thankfully not as boxy as their bags can seem. Its got a slight flattened eggshell shape, which I really like. Best of all, the flat bottom does allow the bag to easily stand on its own.\n\nOn body, with my usual office load out, it does feel heavier than my Evergoods PLC20. Their implementation of Aer's version of the back yoke just doesnt feel as hugging or \"attached\" to my body as Evergood bags, who's design i much prefer. But the carry is quite comfortable, and the burly straps are wonderful. The back mesh is acceptable. It does grab the back of my shirt.\n\nThe amount of internal space doesn't feel as oversized as some seem to describe. And i can imagine this not nearly as big feeling as the Travel Pack Small, and don't think they're in the same league in terms of internal packing space. If anything, feels about the same as my Evergoods CHZ22. I can comfortably fit my small and medium Eagle Creek Spector packing cubes for quick weekend trip.\n\nOne thing to note that I havent really seen mentioned are the nylon straps that attach the straps to the body: their width is much thinner, measuring 3/4” vs the usual 1” on most bags! See 3rd slide. They're about the same width as most sternum straps. At first, kinda stunned me at how thin they looked but after a few days, didnt feel any less secure than usual width'd straps.\n\nAlso, I'm finding the main compartment's flap pocket really unnecessary. I just don't know what its use? Wish the main compartment was just an empty bucket with nothing there but glorious space.\n\nOther than the little niggles, I really like this bag. I wanted something slightly larger than my regular daily carry for those days I'll be carrying some extra gear, and this guy does it nicely.\n\nMore to come!",

I hope this helps. \n\nFirst reactions:\n\n- The 20L PP is noticeably tighter in space than the 24L of CPP.\n- The new material looks and feels high quality, at least in Olive. \n- The new logo doesn’t bother me as much in person. You can barely see it. It’s much more noticeable in stock photos. \n- I’m probably going to return the Pro Pack as I would miss the front bottom pocket more than I’d gain with the valet pocket. \n- Valet pocket fits my fully loaded Aer Slim Pouch",

            "body": "This would have been so helpful when I was deciding between the two bags! I live in UK so once I purchased the Pro Pack there was no going back 😅 \n\nFor reference, I bought the City Pack Pro and returned it for the 20L Pro Pack.\n\nHere’s my thoughts:\n- CPP seemed too big for me for my everyday essentials. I’d never use a bag like that for ‘travel’ so my use case is mainly EDC and I could never see myself filling that up.\n- CPP had a weird hunched forward lean which I found quite frustrating.\n- I never found myself using all of the pockets on the CPP, particularly that small side pocket.\n\nOtherwise a really high quality and satisfying bag. That lead me to think the Pro Pack 20L would be perfect middle ground - less pockets, more refined, smaller for EDC and I do love that valet pocket. So I bought that and heres what I think:\n\n- 20L Pro Pack seems significantly smaller. It’s by far the smallest 20L pack I’ve owned. The Peak design 20L everyday zip is much bigger. \n- Pockets just seem more useful to me but I’m used to having 2 bottle pockets for a coke and a water.\n- Valet pocket (and a couple of other bits) seem lower quality, potentially due to the eco material. It’s just missing some really nice mesh and instead all you’re getting is folded material that doesn’t stretch.\n- Sits up straight and seems more structured than the CPP so you don’t get that forward lean.\n- Straps are just as comfy, maybe very slightly less padded but it’s 20L so not too bad.\n- Bag is quite short and not well shaped to the back like the CPP so for someone of my height (6ft 2”) the bag sort of sits in the arch of my back which could get uncomfortable.\n\nOverall I much prefer the Pro Pack in a lot of ways, but can’t help but think the 24L might have been the better choice due to just how much smaller this one is and how it sits on my back.\n\nMy first time commenting on Reddit so hope it helps someone anyway!",

It feels pretty comfortable but I have relatively wide shoulders (size 40 in suits) \n- The cushion material on back and straps looks different but they feel about the same\n- If you actually use two water bottles (I have Yeti 18oz ramblers) you lose about 3-4 inches of width on the inside. \n- You can fit an additional medium size packing cube or flat’ish pair shoes in CPP after the same load that maxes out PP20\n\n[Added interior comparison here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1255bc3/aer_city_pack_pro_vs_pro_pack_20l_interior_space/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) since Reddit won’t let me add pics to this post\n\nUpdate:  I tried loading out the Pro Pack 20L with what I would normally carry for EDC (roughly half capacity for CPP) and it wasn’t pretty. PP20 has a bulge on top, it looks like the bottom is indented, and my water bottle sticks out quite a bit due to the way the bag tapers down. It’s only noticeably thinner than CPP in the indented area. Returning. [Posted a pic here](https://imgur.com/a/qPF5zy2).",

        "selftext": "Ok this looks like a classic question, but I also have an EDC bag and this would be an adding to my setup, because I fall in this damned rabbit hole and know I would like to have…..so many bag \n\nI have and use Alpaka Metro Backpack Pro 24L as work EDC (I need to take laptop, lab coat and lunch box) and Metro Backpack 12L when I go out for my free time (I am in love with this 12L version)\n\nI just need a bag for weekend trip to take some clothes (and sometimes my laptop) e strolling around cities and country I want to visit (so I need comfort e beefy harnesses system). \n\nYou can’t imagine how little space has Metro 24L, it’s stiff and without clamshell it doesn’t expand, but it’s perfect for my half loadout. But my old school backpack (a simple Eastpack) contains much more clothes.\n\nSo, CPP or TP3Small? I am 5’6 (168cm) so I looked at CPP and thought “damn, that’s perfect for me”, but is it a little bigger than Metro 24L?\n\nOr I would be an idiot with a second 24L back a so “go for TP3Small”? The fear is that is too much big, I never seen a comparation between two on YouTube\n\nThank you for your help",

I would lean towards the CPP, being a whole lb lighter, but I can't know until I use mine. \n\n\nI own the Alpaka elements backpack pro which is 26l and feels much smaller than that, so I get where you're coming from! I would guess that the aer 24l will feel bigger than the Metro pro, but again, can't answer quite yet.

But I like the beefy Aer so would be ok.\n\nAbout CPP instead I like all, and if it is only a little smaller than TP3S would be PERFECT. I could also use it as EDC. In the worst case I would go with TP3S and bye bye EDC alternative, I would became a ninja turtle\n\nWhat I need is a clamshell travel/edc bag NOT SO MUCH BIGGER than my Metro 24L where I can put a medium packing cube with clothes, a Nintendo switch and a small tech pouch (and laptop in his compartment).

I’m getting the city pack pro soon, but that’s because I’m a law student and I’m carrying more stuff than you are. \n\nI think the city pack will be ok for everything listed, with it getting kinda stuffed when you toss in your sling and jacket, but it should manage. If anything the jacket might be the tipping point, might. But the pro def looks to be bigger than you’ll need",

I just don’t want to limit the use of the bag to only being able to carry what I do on the daily. \n\nI will say that the Venture is basically packed when carrying everything plus the extras I listed. So that’s my concern. If it will all fit without being overly tight.",

Comments like this make me think I should just get the CPP but at the same time I don't want it to be obnoxiously big and then just go back to using my Venture for day to day and the CPP for air travel. Most of my traveling is done by vehicle so a smaller backpack accompanied by a duffel is how I typically pack.",
