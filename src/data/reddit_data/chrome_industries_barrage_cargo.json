I have this ILE Default, which I have been loving except for that it's lacking just a tiny bit of fast access organization. Since I have the MOLLE model, I figured I can just add a small pouch onto the outside to give myself said organization, but actually finding a low profile MOLLE pouch online has been a little bit of a struggle. I thought I might as well pick the brains on this sub and see if y'all have any recommendations. \n\nMy criteria would be as follows:\n- fits on the bottom of the Default (3 rows x 6 columns of webbing)\n- is fairly low profile and doesn't stick out from the bag much\n\nThe pouch in the second picture is too bulky and sticks out too much for my taste. I'd like something that doesn't drastically alter the side profile of the bag.\nI have considered the ones made by ILE that are shown in the post, but figured I'd do some more research before buying. Thanks!",

Yet there it was, some visible distress, but those might well not prove deep, or be easy to patch stronger than new. Listed at $27-some odd and the kind feller let me walk away with it for $23.\n\nYea tomorrow I will ascend to a new and rarified level of poser-hipster-punk-trash when I decide which of the three bags to stuff my weed in. \n\nWhere does my degeneracy rank?
