The pro had good organisation and a good space to pack out but now I found it was a little too big....

This time I fell into the claws of tomtoc ( I forget the exact model).\nThis was a suprisingly good bag with more pockets and organisation than I needed. But,   it was to boxy. Good god I'm fussy!

Surely they could be the perfect bag provider! Transit workpack first edition orderd and on its way (didn't want the V2 as it lost lots of organisation!). It arrived and my gosh the materials and quality of the bag was lovely, everything just felt so soft and premium. However and this is a big however, those straps. My god they are probably hands down the worst shoulder straps I have ever experienced! They cut into with only the smallest amount of weight in the bag! Oh well. Time to find my perfect bag.\n\n\nI say this with every my whole chest, Able carry is a god tier bag. The materials are amazing, the comfort is unrivaled, the organisation is perfect for my needs and gosh do I love xpac. This bag looks amazing, feels amazing on my back and ticks all the boxes. Will this mean I don't buy another bag in 2025? Who knows. I do however know that I will be putting this bag through the ringers and enjoying every moment with it!\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for reading that brain dump.

Surely they could be the perfect bag provider! Transit workpack first edition orderd and on its way (didn't want the V2 as it lost lots of organisation!). It arrived and my gosh the materials and quality of the bag was lovely, everything just felt so soft and premium. However and this is a big however, those straps. My god they are probably hands down the worst shoulder straps I have ever experienced! They cut into with only the smallest amount of weight in the bag! Oh well. Time to find my perfect bag.\n\n\nI say this with every my whole chest, Able carry is a god tier bag. The materials are amazing, the comfort is unrivaled, the organisation is perfect for my needs and gosh do I love xpac. This bag looks amazing, feels amazing on my back and ticks all the boxes.

I do however know that I will be putting this bag through the ringers and enjoying every moment with it!\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for reading that brain dump.

        "selftext": "Apologies for the dramatic title but for the last 9 months I've been on a mission to find my perfect bag! This has cumulated into a obsession with bags. But, I know believe I have found \"the one\".\n\nThis journey started around 9 months ago when a changed of work meant I would be commuting and officed based.The perfect excuse to buy a new bag i thought.\n\nAfter many hours on YouTube I found the aer daypack 3 in xpac. Initial impressions where great, I loves the xpac and the front organisation pocket. But after a couple of weeks the honeymoon period ended and I was left with a bag that was just to restrictive for my needs. Alas it was time for another bag.\n\nRoll on to alapaka, there bags where sleek looking and there advertising drew me in, 2 weeks later I had the elements backpack pro and the shift back V3 (not sure what I was thinking there..). Again the initial impressions where good. The quality was top notch and the bags where both great. The pro had good organisation and a good space to pack out but now I found it was a little too big.... This is starting to sound like a Goldie locks problem. \n\nSo ever the explorer I decided to try my luck with another bag... This time I fell into the claws of tomtoc ( I forget the exact model).\nThis was a suprisingly good bag with more pockets and organisation than I needed. But,   it was to boxy. Good god I'm fussy! It also just didn't have the top tier finish I had come to enjoy from the other brands. \n\nBellroy to the rescue? I had the sling mini and I had used and loved that weekly for the last year. Surely they could be the perfect bag provider! Transit workpack first edition orderd and on its way (didn't want the V2 as it lost lots of organisation!). It arrived and my gosh the materials and quality of the bag was lovely, everything just felt so soft and premium. However and this is a big however, those straps. My god they are probably hands down the worst shoulder straps I have ever experienced! They cut into with only the smallest amount of weight in the bag! Oh well. Time to find my perfect bag.\n\n\nI say this with every my whole chest, Able carry is a god tier bag. The materials are amazing, the comfort is unrivaled, the organisation is perfect for my needs and gosh do I love xpac. This bag looks amazing, feels amazing on my back and ticks all the boxes. Will this mean I don't buy another bag in 2025? Who knows. I do however know that I will be putting this bag through the ringers and enjoying every moment with it!\n\nIf you made it this far thank you for reading that brain dump. I know this is the place to come and admit I have a problem with buying bags and I hope you all convince me to buy more.\n\nGoodnight and godbless ",

Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

Also the hidden water bottle eats into the main compartment? Worst of all the bag retains the thin shoulder straps with no added hip belt. As a traveler you'd want a quality carry system.\n\nAll for a total of $329, with no lifetime guarantee? Though, I'll admit it's a nice looking bag like all other Bellroy bags.",

            "body": "Was umming and ahhhing about this backpack but pulled the trigger, even though I was hesitant to spend that kind of money on a bag I hadn't seen in person.  Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

            "body": "Was umming and ahhhing about this backpack but pulled the trigger, even though I was hesitant to spend that kind of money on a bag I hadn't seen in person.  Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

            "body": "Is it just me or does anyone else not see how this is this is geared towards travel? Especially when compared to the existing Venture Ready. I'm really confused by the choices here.\n\nThe biggest differences I see between this an the Venture Ready non-travel is the water-resistant fabric, the gimmicky tote, additional increased dimensions (except the reduction in depth) and hidden water bottle container? I guess you could count the additional interior straps as a travel feature. But the bag only has a 6.1 inch depth, so is that really needed?\n\nDimensions measure 22 inches x 15.75 inches x 6.1, so it can't take advantage of the typical carry on sizes (22 in x 14 in x 9 in) offered by major airlines and it's too big for a personal item. Also the hidden water bottle eats into the main compartment? Worst of all the bag retains the thin shoulder straps with no added hip belt. As a traveler you'd want a quality carry system.\n\nAll for a total of $329, with no lifetime guarantee? Though, I'll admit it's a nice looking bag like all other Bellroy bags.",

Having it in hand, I can see it’s no worse than all the other backpacks I’ve had in the past.  I also can understand the hate for it - being way overpriced for its size. But nothing wrong on this end, very usable day to day, durable and proved great for a weekend getaway. Some features may seem gimmicky but usable. I’ve used the zipper water bottle pocket - it’s great. Tote, used it, works, is actually a decent shape and clips on the front of bag, so don’t need to awkwardly hold in on shoulder with the pack. Yes RFID is pointless. ",

I packed it up like I would on a flight with a Hydroflask, an Eagle Creek quarter packing cube with a light merino layer, and my EDC Tom Bihn Side Effect. My sunnies case and a coin purse with advil/nail clippers/etc... went in the inside pocket and keys clipped to the leash. It folds down into quarters slightly smaller than the 1/4 packing cube and much thinner. It can also roll up into a large fist sized roll but I think that would take up unnecessary space in my main bag (either a Kanken, a Tom Bihn Paragon or S25 depending on the trip).\n\nThe whole tote is really light, not much more than the packable grocery bags I use. I'll likely fold it into quarters and slide it in the top of my main pack, with the Side Effect worn cross body. Before boarding I'll slide out the tote, throw in the Side Effect and pop all my in flight bits in. There is still room for a bigger sweater or snacks and the book I inevitably acquire while waiting to board. The straps are a good length to wear over a jacket and not too slippery. I prefer a tote to be wider than tall and this is visually a good size on me but might look a little small if you're a big guy (I'm a US size 16, 5ft 10\" tall woman). I do wish there was a clip or something to hold it rolled up but other than that it's great.",

It can also roll up into a large fist sized roll but I think that would take up unnecessary space in my main bag (either a Kanken, a Tom Bihn Paragon or S25 depending on the trip).\n\nThe whole tote is really light, not much more than the packable grocery bags I use. I'll likely fold it into quarters and slide it in the top of my main pack, with the Side Effect worn cross body. Before boarding I'll slide out the tote, throw in the Side Effect and pop all my in flight bits in. There is still room for a bigger sweater or snacks and the book I inevitably acquire while waiting to board. The straps are a good length to wear over a jacket and not too slippery. I prefer a tote to be wider than tall and this is visually a good size on me but might look a little small if you're a big guy (I'm a US size 16, 5ft 10\" tall woman). I do wish there was a clip or something to hold it rolled up but other than that it's great.",

The 30L seems a good size with decent amount of storage. Laptop is protected by a stiff plate between it and the backpack straps. Backpack straps are nicely padded, nuch nore robust than their Lite ready packs.\n\nThe main compartment and top pocket zippers do not having locking loops on them, but the lower pocket and thr laptop pocket have a fanncy zipper where it can only be opened if the zipper is lifted up.\n\nThere's also an attachment loop top right of the bag, that lines with anothet loop bottom right of the bag, which would seem suggest a shoilder strap for duffel carry, but Bellroy doesn't supply such a strap.\n",

Compared to the Chimera, it is extremely hard to justify double the price of that limited edition bag. It’s literally the exact same bag with some nitpicky details being different. However in person, the Venture backpack just looks more professional and sophisticated making it a more suitable option for EDC/the office than the Chimera! I like the Chimera a lot less now and regret buying it.",

I wasn't sure how I'd feel about it, only owning a few ripstop items that I use in cycling, I was concerned it would feel plastic-y. But I got it, love it, love the material, feels like a nicely worn in windbreaker almost",

Typically I've always had a roller that usually goes in the overhead bin along with a small backpack. But decided to remove that outright and just settle for one bag and nothing else.\n\nHence the 28 Liter Bellroy Transit bag\n\n**The Dilemma**\n\nI was debating between the 20 Liter and the 28 Liter. There's a ton of happy campers with the 20 Liter variant but admittedly they mentioned that the 20 liter wasn't a Onebag travel bag. It's more used for EDC stuff.\n\n**Gripes and Gloss**\n\nThere's things that people love about this bag. And there's things people don't like.\n\nPeople love the look of it. It really is a beautiful looking bag.\n\nPeople love the simplicity of it\n\nPeople love that it's a clamshell opening\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05oj2v3q3r591.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2093738683a890eefa2d4030a6b11693de7ecd67\n\nPeople love that it can be used as carry-on\n\nPeople love that it  can be used as a personal item if you don't stuff it\n\nPeople love that it can be used as an EDC bag somewhat if you don't stuff it\n\nPeople hate the water pouch. Problem is that the water pouch can't even fit a 20 oz Zojirushi bottle. It also eats into the space.\n\nPeople are so-so about the comfort of it.\n\nPeople don't like the consistency of it. The black version is the best made version. It's not just a color thing. The entire material is different depending on what color you choose.  If you choose a blue one, it's something else entirely and looks far cheaper. Bellroy has different material depending on which variant of the 28 liter you get. The best version is the black one. Don't get the other colors as those are made of uglier, cheaper materials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1o8t44v14r591.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45ff65a7e316bdbdedf4c9b67cf1365f078ad94e\n\n**Ok so how much can it hold?**\n\nSo it can hold quite a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n**All of the images below are what fit inside the bag.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FRONT POCKET\n\n[2 wet wipes, coin bag, passport, 2 pens, Logitech K380, Vapur water bottle, Field notes](https://preview.redd.it/wbkveg8hcr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43d789401993068b1f2f42fb78c558d7cf743c4d)\n\n# INSIDE THE CLAMSHELL OPENING\n\n[2 shorts, Matador towel, eye cover](https://preview.redd.it/4fpoacnncr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86fe59c9c156e717307e87eb9087d78d14f3e055)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A bunch of Anker cables, chargers, Logitech Pebble, thumb drive, battery, USB hub, tiny flashlight](https://preview.redd.it/2evp2auucr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=193768bd43c0ffedb15ae4174fb5ef7e00339ca1)\n\n[4 shirts, 4 underwear, 4 socks](https://preview.redd.it/1ngbcbl1dr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15649862061bc504b45cebca64f723f28f6b7bde)\n\n[OneBlade, chapstick, deodorant, contact lens, lotion, sunblock, Toothbrush, melatonin, earplugs, cologne \\(I just realized I needed to add toothpaste\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rjtmjpu1er591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a338fdd953fdd655f20db82ce13dfd2cca0d920e)\n\n[Sennheiser MKH 416, XLR cable, portable neck pillow, belt, shockmount, Tripod, Zoom F3](https://preview.redd.it/q44153badr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bf169a1214188699a79eb28266e1af5166c6667)\n\n# BACK OPENING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Moondrop Blessing 2, Surface Go, Macbook Pro](https://preview.redd.it/4tpllupger591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b0268757571c3f4a7f2bf9126107a4a5f67193)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok so how bad are the flaws of this bag?**\n\nSo as mentioned there are 2 major flaws of this bag. The 1st flaw is that there's a slot in the back where you're supposed to put a water bottle. But the problem is that when you put a water bottle in there it's very difficult to take out. I consider myself fairly athletic and it wasn't easy to take out. Required a lot of force with a Zojirushi 20 oz bag.\n\n2nd major flaw is that the straps are a bit thin. They also kind of have an edge to them. So it can be uncomfortable.\n\n**Can it be fixed?**\n\nYes! In a way.\n\nHere was my workaround.\n\nI just didn't use the water pouch. Instead I just brought a Vapur Water bottle instead. The problem with using the water pouch is that when you put a water bottle inside, it eats into your space. So I solved the problem by just not getting a hard-case water bottle. That said if I really really wanted to get a water bottle like a Hydroflask to work on this, I'd either pack it inside or I'd attach it with a carabine on the outside.\n\n**But what about the straps?**\n\nI found a way to fix the problem. What you can do is buy shoulder pads on Amazon and when you attach them to the bag it becomes much much more comfortable. So I modded the Bellroy bag to be super duper comfortable by buying one of these shoulder pads. Shoulder pads like these: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHKVRX7/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHKVRX7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yf18hwxcku591.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3518d54b89475a283d92eced3adb1dfcd85940cd\n\n**How much did it weigh in the end?**\n\nIt weighed a total of 15 pounds for everything here. So by all accounts it should be enough to pass through to any airline.\n\n**My overall thoughts**\n\nI am super stoked with this bag! I love how it looks. And as mentioned, when you add the shoulder pads, it makes it super comfortable. And I don't mind that I don't use the water pouch - because by just using a Vapur water bottle, I save so much space. So overall a really great Onebag. I'd even argue that I should and could be bringing much less. But this just goes to show how much it can hold! :D\n\nThat's all folks! :D",

For privacy reasons I don’t want to show pics of how I had it packed, but know I had plenty of room to spare! I ended up picking up a plush toy and a sweatshirt that also fit in just fine, and I was still able to shove it under my seat on the plane. \n\nIt’s got a water bottle holder, which I love — most of the travel backpacks I’ve seen omit this. Chest and waist straps and the shoulder straps can be put away if you want to carry it like a duffel. I’m so glad I found this bag and plan to use it for most of my short flights from now on!",

The green and gray small pouch is by the Doughbut brand—bought that one on JetPens—and it contains work items like my badge and work keys. I carry everything in my backpack into my clinic and office areas, then if I’m lucky with a lunch break, I take the sling with me to grab coffee or go on a quick walk. That allows me to carry my badge, keys, AirPods, phone, and sometimes a book with me without the “bigness” of the backpack for what’s usually a pretty quick jaunt outside. On the weekends, that little green pouch gets tucked away, and I use the backpack for daily carry. I have been LOVING this setup so far!!!",

            "body": "I’m intrigued by this bag, honestly. The look leaves a little bit to be desired, but the functionality is what’s piqued my interest. My use case would be car travel and business travel by air. For business travel, I have to take a pair or two of dress shoes that I’ve put a lot of time and energy into shining properly and I refuse to check those so I always end up traveling with backpack, duffel, and carry-on suitcase that I check. Clothes in the carry-on, shoes in the duffel, work tech in the backpack. \n\nI have the Peak Design travel duffel 35L, and hate it. The carry handles are horrendous; the magnets don’t work at all, either to snap the carry handles together or to snap the bag’s sides down as advertised; and the bag itself has no real structure and sags down in the middle at the bottom like every other trash duffel I’ve had. The exterior pockets are fine, but not revolutionary. The only thing it does well is look really good. \n\nI’m not as triggered to immediately buy the EG TD35 as I’ve been to buy their CPLs, CTB26, and CAPs, but I’m leaning towards giving it the ol’ college try. I think with packing cubes, it’ll load beautifully and do exactly what I need it to do, but do it better than any other duffel I’ve tried. \n\nI do wish they’d given us the option to either load a laptop or use that panel as a luggage pass-through. A simple extra panel of 840D fabric on that exterior side would’ve given us the choice.",

It's 840D fabric and I'm sure their seams are more than up to the task. The thread they use is like fishing wire.\n\nAnd as another comment said, it's actually spreading the load across a wider area which should be a good thing.",
