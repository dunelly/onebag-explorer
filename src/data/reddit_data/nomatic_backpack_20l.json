            "body": "**Review**:\n\nA few weeks back, I decided that my Yeti Crossover 27 would not cut it for an international business trip I have coming up in a couple of weeks.  While I have never had an issue using that bag as my personal item, I’m sick of sacrificing legroom for it, and it’s not the type of item I’d bring to a client's office.  I decided to check in and see if my favorite internet strangers here on Reddit had any opinions on backpacks, and I stumbled across this subreddit.  Glad to see that I’m not the only detailed obsessed gearhead out there!\n\nMy Use Case: With two weeks in Europe to meet with clients in the field, I needed a backpack that would look professional but would complement my B&amp;G Spinner as my personal item.  That turned out to be a bit of an issue for me as the EDC bags tended to lack some of my travel bag requirements (luggage pass-through, side handle, clamshell opening, etc) while the travel backpacks (like the Aer Travel 3 Small) had the same issue as my Yeti, their size cannibalized my legroom and would potentially look weird in an office setting (I have to be hyper-focused on this because it’s not *my* office).\n\nAfter days of research, the closest I had come was the Evergoods CTB 20 (which was out of stock and still probably bigger than what I wanted), and the Black Ember Citadel 20 (which was expensive, required additional purchases for handles, and I was turned off by the complex, seemingly redundant internal storage).  I was about to give up when one of you beautiful people put the Sympl Commuter 20L in some random comment.\n\n**The Bag**:\n\nI’m pretty sure I ordered this bag on the last day of pre-orders and it just showed up today.  It’s probably premature for a review since I haven’t used it yet, but overall I’m pretty psyched about it.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* It looks fantastic\n* The harness is luxuriously thick and comfortable\n* It checks all of my non-negotiables:\n   * Smaller size while still being able to easily fit my personal item stuff.\n   * Luggage passthrough\n   * Side handle\n   * Admin panel\n   * Drop pocket \n   * Clam shell opening\n   * Stands on it’s own",

            "body": "Just got mine yesterday as well so I'll join the party!\n\nThe water bottle pocket sounds good in theory, but even with a 24oz bottle it's kind of a pain to take in and out; it's a tight fit.  I'm just going to carry my bottle in the main compartment, I prefer a 32oz anyway.  The pocket is a good size for a typical 20oz bottled water, Monster can, or similar.  Good for a quick drink stash before getting on the plane\n\nI'm disappointed with the laptop sleeve design.  I have a thin and light 15\" laptop for work and they advertised the bag as holding up to a 16\" laptop.  I could only get it in by sliding the laptop in \"short side first\" then forcing it through the opening at an angle.  The zipper has a little strap that blocks access of the entire length of the opening (you can see it in your second pic).  I cut this strap off so I could have access to the entire zippered opening and now i can slide my laptop in fine.  I think they should remove that.\n\nI agree the admin pouch is tighter than i was expecting.  I can carry a lot less than i thought I could.  But it did make me consolidate to only the true daily stuff.  I also would have preferred two zippers here.\n\nThe internal zippered pouch, next to the black slide pouch, is too tight for anything except a fieldnotes or passport.  No compliance in the zipper.\n\nThe front pocket seems pretty useless.  Poor access to the slip pockets.  I guess it could be good for loose items you need to stash quickly like receipts in the airport for reimbursement from work.  I think it would be much more useful with an accordion opening like the admin panel.\n\n  \nI also wish they would have put the side handle such that when it's on your rolling luggage, the front pocket zipper was accessible.  Currently this pocket faces down when the side handle is up, meaning you can't use the front pocket when its on your luggage.  Kind of a strange oversight.  Or better yet, make the luggage strap horizontal.\n\nDespite all my complaints the bag does look and feel very nice and high quality, and it's comfortable to wear.  I also LOVE that it self stands no matter what you have in it, or don't have in it.  Going to give it a shot as my work daily.",

Thought maybe it was there to force the zipper pull into a locked position, but clearly it's not locked when flat.  Maybe some kind of anti-theft thing?  Getting rid of it was a clever solution to the \"big laptop\" problem, though.\n\nI also find that my 20 oz Kleen Kanteen and Hydroflasks fit pretty well into the water bottle pocket (though I wouldn't say \"easy\"), but my Contigo travel mug has a slight flare in the lid where you sip from...if the flare is positioned to point outward, it causes a bulge in the zipper guaranteed to break it eventually.  If the flare faces inward, there's no problem (though I did find out the hard way that, in this position, if I forgot to set the \"button lock\" on the travel mug, the pressure of the elastic on the mug's \"press to drink\" button will cause the contents to immediately spill out when the bag is on its side)\n\nHaven't transferred my admin panel stuff to the top tech compartment yet, so can't evaluate that.

            "body": "Just got mine yesterday, agree with most your review. Overall, fantastic bag. One of the best I've ever owned and very happy with it having used it for 24 hours. A few additional notes:\n\n* Love the organization features. Lots of separate pockets and compartments.\n   * Despite that, I wish there were one or two pen slots to slip writing utensils or a stylus in. Right now I'm throwing them into the zippered compartment in the \"tech caddy\", but they kinda just sit in there like a pencil case.\n   * I also wish the laptop compartment had a suspended/false bottom. It feels like the pocket runs all the way to the bottom of the bag. There's still a good amount of padding at the bottom, so I'm not too worried, but would have been nice to have that peace of mind if I ever drop the bag.\n* The back panel is padded and breathable, and very comfortable to wear.\n   * However, it's very \"stiff\" in the sense that it in no way adjusts to the curvature of my back. This makes it able to stand up nicely on its own when put down, but while I'm wearing it it *visually* looks like I've got a plank of wood attached to my back. So while comfortable, I'm not sure I love aesthetically how it sits against my back just yet.\n* The water bottle holder is sleek the way it gets hidden away, but my 24 oz. Owala barely fits in, and takes some effort to zip up. This is not a quick access thing if you have a sizable water bottle.\n\nThese things are far from dealbreakers, and the pros outweigh the cons by a large margin. Highly recommend this bag!",

I'm just going to carry my bottle in the main compartment, I prefer a 32oz anyway.  The pocket is a good size for a typical 20oz bottled water, Monster can, or similar.  Good for a quick drink stash before getting on the plane\n\nI'm disappointed with the laptop sleeve design.  I have a thin and light 15\" laptop for work and they advertised the bag as holding up to a 16\" laptop.  I could only get it in by sliding the laptop in \"short side first\" then forcing it through the opening at an angle.  The zipper has a little strap that blocks access of the entire length of the opening (you can see it in your second pic).  I cut this strap off so I could have access to the entire zippered opening and now i can slide my laptop in fine.  I think they should remove that.\n\nI agree the admin pouch is tighter than i was expecting.  I can carry a lot less than i thought I could.  But it did make me consolidate to only the true daily stuff.  I also would have preferred two zippers here.\n\nThe internal zippered pouch, next to the black slide pouch, is too tight for anything except a fieldnotes or passport.  No compliance in the zipper.\n\nThe front pocket seems pretty useless.  Poor access to the slip pockets.  I guess it could be good for loose items you need to stash quickly like receipts in the airport for reimbursement from work.  I think it would be much more useful with an accordion opening like the admin panel.\n\n  \nI also wish they would have put the side handle such that when it's on your rolling luggage, the front pocket zipper was accessible.  Currently this pocket faces down when the side handle is up, meaning you can't use the front pocket when its on your luggage.  Kind of a strange oversight.  Or better yet, make the luggage strap horizontal.\n\nDespite all my complaints the bag does look and feel very nice and high quality, and it's comfortable to wear.  I also LOVE that it self stands no matter what you have in it, or don't have in it.  Going to give it a shot as my work daily.",

This makes it able to stand up nicely on its own when put down, but while I'm wearing it it *visually* looks like I've got a plank of wood attached to my back. So while comfortable, I'm not sure I love aesthetically how it sits against my back just yet.\n* The water bottle holder is sleek the way it gets hidden away, but my 24 oz. Owala barely fits in, and takes some effort to zip up.

I'm just going to carry my bottle in the main compartment, I prefer a 32oz anyway.  The pocket is a good size for a typical 20oz bottled water, Monster can, or similar.  Good for a quick drink stash before getting on the plane\n\nI'm disappointed with the laptop sleeve design.  I have a thin and light 15\" laptop for work and they advertised the bag as holding up to a 16\" laptop.  I could only get it in by sliding the laptop in \"short side first\" then forcing it through the opening at an angle.  The zipper has a little strap that blocks access of the entire length of the opening (you can see it in your second pic).  I cut this strap off so I could have access to the entire zippered opening and now i can slide my laptop in fine.  I think they should remove that.\n\nI agree the admin pouch is tighter than i was expecting.  I can carry a lot less than i thought I could.  But it did make me consolidate to only the true daily stuff.  I also would have preferred two zippers here.\n\nThe internal zippered pouch, next to the black slide pouch, is too tight for anything except a fieldnotes or passport.  No compliance in the zipper.\n\nThe front pocket seems pretty useless.  Poor access to the slip pockets.  I guess it could be good for loose items you need to stash quickly like receipts in the airport for reimbursement from work.  I think it would be much more useful with an accordion opening like the admin panel.\n\n  \nI also wish they would have put the side handle such that when it's on your rolling luggage, the front pocket zipper was accessible.  Currently this pocket faces down when the side handle is up, meaning you can't use the front pocket when its on your luggage.  Kind of a strange oversight.  Or better yet, make the luggage strap horizontal.\n\nDespite all my complaints the bag does look and feel very nice and high quality, and it's comfortable to wear.  I also LOVE that it self stands no matter what you have in it, or don't have in it.  Going to give it a shot as my work daily.",

This makes it able to stand up nicely on its own when put down, but while I'm wearing it it *visually* looks like I've got a plank of wood attached to my back. So while comfortable, I'm not sure I love aesthetically how it sits against my back just yet.\n* The water bottle holder is sleek the way it gets hidden away, but my 24 oz. Owala barely fits in, and takes some effort to zip up.

        "selftext": "Hi all, I just wanted to share my positive experience with Nomatic as a brand. I bought a 20L Travel Pack for $150 back in 2020, and probably within a year the metal tabs of the magnetic bottle pockets ripped through the fabric. It didn’t really affect usability, so I ignored this because I didn’t want to have to send the bag back. That was until 2 months ago, when the front pocket zipper rail tore away from the bag, making the front zipper unusable. At that point, functionality was impaired, so I decided to start looking for a new bag, which brought me to this subreddit.\n\nAside from all of the negative comments regarding Nomatic, I saw one mention that they have a lifetime warranty for certain defects (including broken zippers), so I reached out to Nomatic to see if they could provide a replacement. They approved a return about two weeks later, and once they received the bag, they offered me a credit for the original purchase price of the bag. I reached out via their chat system and pointed out that their return policy states it should be a full replacement, as this was not a discontinued product, and the bag now costs double what I initially paid for it. Cam from Nomatic looked into it and changed it to a full replacement within minutes, no questions asked.\n\nObviously, it would be great if none of this was necessary in the first place, but in my experience it’s increasingly rare to have that kind of responsiveness with warranty claims. I’m generally happy with the bag itself, so I just want to give credit where it’s due.",

Didn't even want it but now is my most used bag haha\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qci1b8a3u0c1.jpeg?width=3492&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c990e11b3ebefe37d10188d47cee39abb149fdc",

The 20L Travel uses mostly coated zippers and one uncoated zipper on the expansion. Also, I presume all of the zippers on the Essential are YKK, whereas the Travel uses a mix of YKK and Zoom.   \n- The Essential has a back panel similar to the 14L Travel variant, with horizontal luggage passthrough, no hidden passport pocket, and non-stowable straps. The 20L Travel has vertical passthrough, stowable straps, and the hidden back pocket.  \n- The Essential is missing a couple of mesh dividers in the admin compartment and the main compartment.  \n\nPersonally, I prefer all of the changes in the Essential, so for me it's a win-win that the Essential is significantly cheaper.",

One of the best bags I've had.\n\nIt really seems to do the job well as a smaller pack for every day work and as a personal item on flights. A couple times I've expanded it to the 20L and got 4 days worth of clothes in it (including shoes). And that 14L size that can still expand if needed was important to me. Kinda hard to find that with the features included. Gets tons of compliments as well.\n\nThe issue is that everyone values something different, as you mention. When I was researching initially, none of the suggested alternatives fit the bill for me. But I am slowly being drawn in, I'm trying not to buy many more bags that I dont really need haha.",

They look great, as the bag is expandable to cater for those extra bits. \n\nHas anyone used one before? They are on the more expensive side (£279) so wanting to look at options. \n\nThanks all. ",

For every setting where I don't need camera gear, the versatility of the 30L Travel is just - awesome.   \nTypical use:\n\n\\- everyday office   \n\\- overnight trips as complete luggage  \n\\- Hand luggage that goes along with check in stuff or cabin trolley   \n\\- shopping \n\nTried over the years lots of setups for my different needs and now have LOTs of different style of bags at home - since I got the Travel almost no use any more. \n\nThe only thing that I miss is that I'm not so satisfied with S Camera cube integration. It works, yes, but for a V2 I'd like to see a side access and some possibility to have a great match with a sling size camera pouch. Just something i could better trow in my A7 and a additional optic.",

        "selftext": "Over the last six months or so, I’ve been searching for the perfect bag. Today, with the Evergoods Civic Travel Bag 26L Griffin, I may have found it!\n\nI’ve purchased, used, and loved all of these bags. This form ruined my life (and finances LOL!!), I was happy with my Swiss Gear bags. Then, my life changed. \n\nIf I had to rate the top three that stand out to me, the CTB I got today is easily the #1, and a work of art. Packing it out, it seems on point. The quality and materials, seem well worth the price of admission. \n\nSecond, the City Pack Pro, this is a bag I’ve grown to love for EDC, but felt something missing (like a side handle and the pretty small top pouch for organization!). \n\nThird, the bag I wanted to love, is the Travel Pack 3 Small. Bag is almost perfect, but a bit “too bulky” for EDC. \n\nThe Alpaka Elements Backpack Pro is a solid, smaller bag not bad for daily carry. \n\nEvery one of these has some advantages and opportunities. I don’t see much for the Evergoods bag tho! Think this one’s a winner! ",

So bad, that I regretfully returned the bag.   \n  \nAll the layers inside met about that spot where the lower of the two pulls is in your picture, if bag wasn't full the fabric would make a bend that stopped zipper from moving freely.  I was told it was partially because of the heavier fabric in the Griffin edition, but \"by design\" and it couldn't be helped so I returned it.   \n  \nOh why I clicked this thread open. Now I want to try that CTB also... :P",
