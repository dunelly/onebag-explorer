I have been using Fj√§llr√§ven products for the last four to five years and they do seem to last for life. \n\nThank you for the information on the seat pads.

If you are coming from a clamshell it may take some time getting used to it. I had a Arcteryx Brize 25 so the bucket/cavernous space is not that much a difference from a use perspective but the comfort, carry and volume is significantly better on the Smith. The amount the thing can carry is phenomenal and find it perfect for one bag travel. Try Chase Reeves, Odie Matthews and Rushfaster on YouTube for there review. I love the bag, design, flexibility for day use and travel.",

I also didn't like that the laptop section wasn't padded against the main section. When it was packed full, laptop would catch on stuff in the main section. I just got a ynot magnetica which I kind of put in the same category as the Smith and find it better thus far for my needs. Definitely a different vibe though than the Millican heritage look.",

Functional.  \n\nEver since having a kid, I find myself taking more and more items with me each time I leave the house. (Extra clothing, hand sanitizer, wipes, tissues, snacks, jackets, gloves, drinks, diapers, small first aid items, etc.) And that‚Äôs before I include any of my own edc items.  \nI‚Äôve made due for years with some other packs I already have around (Burton Tinder tote, generic Fanny pack, Jack Wolfskin Berkeley) but have been looking for something a bit more sharp/sophisticated yet practical and home both in the city/traveling/ and the outdoors.  This appears to check many of my boxes and I like the expansion ability of the rolltop without there being too many external straps.\n\nMainly (and for the money) I need for it to hold up from a quality perspective and to be effectively utilitarian in its function.\n    \n\nI ordered one last week, and it arrived with the bags back padding oddly creased/kinked/folded and bulging in the middle. My first impressions of the bag were very positive but this small damage/defect slightly undermined my confidence in the products.\n/materials.  \n\nI ordered another (will return the first one) from the same retailer and the crease is not present, though a small bulge is vaguely showing in the new bag in the same location.   \nUnexpectedly, the replacement pack also had slightly different components/features, such as an additional external tripod/hiking pole strap, and slightly different buckles, size straps, as well as small additions like leather reinforcements around the hook straps, and fleece lining on the tablet sleeve, the original bag did not have. The material felt slightly different, and the back padding was slightly different.  \nI am presuming this is actually a newer/updated model as things like the leather reinforcements would logically be in response to typical wear points on the bag.   \nHowever I have not been able to verify anything on different versions existing and the retailer mentions no distinction anyone on the listing or website.",

Currently they're about ¬£125 so significantly cheaper. Shipping is probably about 2-3 weeks for Europe. \n\nSimple roll top closure, highly water resistant, high quality metal parts and expandable capacity. I have the 18L Smith - comfy straps and I found it more than enough for daily hikes when travelling, could probably one-bag on it for a week. The rolltop closure can be a bit of a faff but it feels bombproof. The waxed cotton fabric is really tough and I think will last me a lifetime.

On the one hand, this is a good thing for small manufacturers as they don't need to reach scale in Vietnam to be profitable. On the other hand, some of the more functional, basic production bags like the Brown Buffalo Conceal are way out of reach (for me) now in terms of price.\n\nI said this about a year ago when the first Carryology x MR bag came out for $350. $350 for a backpack!! Imagine that. The only bags that dared to go more than that were the ROFMIA and Nomin. \n\nMy sweet spot for bags is typically $150 - $250. Evade 1.5, MR UA 24, Millican Smith, Able Carry Max, RFF 24, Tom Bihn Synapse 25l, etc. \n\nMaybe I need to stop thinking like a Manny Bagger moron that somehow needs more (many more) than 10 bags, and thinking more like buy-it-for-life one bag.
