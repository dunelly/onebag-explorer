I’m pretty happy with it overall, it’s reasonably compact and has everything I need for a day of shooting. \n\nThe bag is a WANDRD PRVKE 31L with the Pro Plus insert. I am able to fit the Intrepid 4x5, three Schneider lenses with lens boards (90/f5.6, 150/f5.6, 210/f5.6), 4 film holders, 6 filters, dark cloth, loupe and few other little bits. Not pictured is the travel-ish tripod that straps to the side of the bag. \n\nIt’s not a cheap bag by any means but it is really well made and thoughtfully designed. There’s no getting around the weight of all that stuff but it does fit comfortably and has as much support as you could hope from a bag without a proper frame. I have a separate smaller insert for carrying 35mm or digital kits and it takes ~5min to swap out the inserts, the biggest advantage being that I don’t have to pull out everything individually, the insert just comes out and everything stays together and stays protected in storage. \n\nAnother big plus for me is that it looks a bit more stylish than the average camera bag and I don’t immediately stand out as a camera dweeb, unless I’m walking around wearing the darkcloth like a cape.

You can see the difference in actual storage space vs the overall size of the bag in that last pic of just the insert. Technically you could throw a couple straps on that insert and wear it like a backpack and it is significantly smaller, but it’s obviously not meant to be carried like that everyday.\n\nI initially had the camera in the bottom but realized that I could squeeze in the 150mm lens next to it up top and I like that the top half has the little zippered cover that protects the ground glass. My only complaint with this arrangement is that the film holders are a little tough to access way at the bottom, especially if trying to get into it without laying it down and completely unzipping the back.",

I already have a pretty good bag for the 67 and I can still fit it in if I really want to fit it in the PRVKE, I just have to take the lenses off.

There’s no getting around the weight of all that stuff but it does fit comfortably and has as much support as you could hope from a bag without a proper frame. I have a separate smaller insert for carrying 35mm or digital kits and it takes ~5min to swap out the inserts, the biggest advantage being that I don’t have to pull out everything individually, the insert just comes out and everything stays together and stays protected in storage. \n\nAnother big plus for me is that it looks a bit more stylish than the average camera bag and I don’t immediately stand out as a camera dweeb, unless I’m walking around wearing the darkcloth like a cape.

I don’t think it’s the latest one based on the official website photos. Doesn’t matter to me, but was curious.",

Even though I'm not a photographer/ don't travel with camera gear, the bag has worked so well for me.  My work trips are usually only several days - 1week long and 21L has been more than enough space for me. The camera compartment is removable and has plenty of space for my clothes. I love the clamshell opening- it makes packing and accessing items really easy. The back flap has lots of pockets and a really nice padded laptop sleeve, and I love that I can easily access my laptop without having to open up the bag completely. My favorite feature is the roll top compartment, which adds an additional 5L. The water bottle sleeve is kind of small, but I usually hold my water bottle so it's not a huge issue for me. The only issue I've had so far is that if I pack my bag to the absolute max then it is a bit difficult to slide underneath the plane seat. Also, if you fully extend the roll top, it doesn't fit under the seat completely so I end up having to move it to the overhead bins.

            "body": "I travel once a month every 1-2 months for work and making the switch to one-bagging has been life changing. I decided to invest in the Wandrd Prvke 21L and absolutely love it. Even though I'm not a photographer/ don't travel with camera gear, the bag has worked so well for me.  My work trips are usually only several days - 1week long and 21L has been more than enough space for me. The camera compartment is removable and has plenty of space for my clothes. I love the clamshell opening- it makes packing and accessing items really easy. The back flap has lots of pockets and a really nice padded laptop sleeve, and I love that I can easily access my laptop without having to open up the bag completely. My favorite feature is the roll top compartment, which adds an additional 5L. The water bottle sleeve is kind of small, but I usually hold my water bottle so it's not a huge issue for me. The only issue I've had so far is that if I pack my bag to the absolute max then it is a bit difficult to slide underneath the plane seat. Also, if you fully extend the roll top, it doesn't fit under the seat completely so I end up having to move it to the overhead bins. The bag measures about 18inches tall if I'm not using the roll top compartment.\n\nI'm going to a tech conference in SF this week , and wanted to share what I'm packing with me. The weather is supposed to be in the upper 50s/low 60's and chances of rain, hence the rain jacket. I decided not to pack a puffer jacket and plan to just layer up.  For this trip I only plan on bringing 1pair of shoes which I will be wearing on the plane with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClothes:\n\n1. fleece jacket\n2. wool cardigan, black jeans, and tank top ( wearing on plane)\n3. button down shirt\n4. long sleeve shirt\n5. tshirt and shorts (pjs)\n6. sweat pants\n7. rainjacket\n8. 3 pairs underwear\n9. extra pair of wool socks\n10. belt\n\nToiletries:\n\n1. deodorant\n2. face wash\n3. makeup remover\n4. face cream\n5. face serum\n6. hair oil\n7. hand cream\n8. makeup\n9. toothbrush + toothpaste\n10. medicine/first aid kit\n11. hair brush\n\nMisc items:\n\n1. jewelry case\n2. wallet\n3. notebook\n4. sunglasses\n5. macbook + phone charger + laptop charger  (not pictured)\n6. stanley 30oz water bottle (not pictured)",

Now that I have them here, the decision was easy. Was expecting the Wandrd to be too big, but it’s perfect. All the compartments, ways to get to stuff, roll top, they just work like I want a backpack to work and fit everything I want (which is clothing in packing cubes (picture), a camera in the peak design sling 3L (pictured) and enough space left for other essentials and MacBook AND iPad. And it still doesn’t feel cramped. Love the look as well. Very happy. If you’re on the verge and looking for a bag and we’re looking at one of them, feel free to AMA. \n\nThe heimplanet is not a fair comparison. It’s smaller, not as accessible, looks good as well but doesn’t seem as durable (but the material is sustainable..).",

                "body": "Yes! I’ve used it for many trips, some just a weekend, some 2 weeks. I wasn’t too sure on the quality of the Wandrd, some of the parts, like the main zip and the zippers between laptop compartment and the main compartment felt cheap in the beginning. But having used it, I feel like it is super sturdy and nothing creaks or is not top notch quality. I love the size, the many super useful little gadgets, like the quickaccess from the left small compartment. The small fleece lined tech pocket is nice for small things like keys and AirPods, but I find it interferes with the two big pockets of the bag and is inelegantly in the way at times. The magnetic tote handles are a nice idea, but the magnets are a joke. The expandable roll top leaves some extra space, which is super helpful. The water bottle pocket is handy, but could be bigger (a 950 ml Nalgene hardly fits). But all in all, I wanted a backpack for onebagging that has very good quick access to a laptop, a roll top, and useful pockets. The wandrd is perfect for me in that regard. I could use more Liters, the 41 litre version must be awesome, but I don’t want the bigger overall size. I decided for longer trips I’ll get an additional small suitcase. For shorter trips I can easily fit my clothes, a tech kit, dop kit and a peak design 3L camera sling in the wandrd and have a very mobile travelling backpack still. Can recommend. I bought the heimplanet packing cubes, and find that they are a very good addition to the wandrd prvke.",

Even like three days of clothes is too heavy and breaks the Velcro unless the bottom compartment is full (from like a camera cube).

Ultimately, I went with Wandrd.\n\nI have to say, the build quality on this bag is superb. I don't have the previous versions of this bag to compare to, but the bag has very good materials and feels great on the back. I also got the photo bundle which includes the essential camera cube; great for my Sony A6400 + 2 lenses.\n\nI have a Japan/Korea trip coming up this year and am very excited to see how this bag will perform on the upcoming trip. \n\nWhat are your experiences with the Wandrd Prvke as a travel/camera bag?",

This bag is very well built and very VERY comfortable. The only gripe I had was that there aren't many pockets to put small stuff in.\n\nWandrd sells a \"pouch\" but I cant find any reviews or something about it. The tech pouch from Peak Design looked very tempting although a bit expensive. I decided to jump on it an boy, what a great combo.\n\nThe pouch fits in PERFECTLY, like it was made for it. \n\nThe organization of the pouch is also very good, so I keep all my small things like dongles, SSD, cables, charger bricks and cleaning stuff for my lenses in it.\n\nOnce again not trying to start any discussion, just wanted to share!\n\nHave a nice day,\n\nRiemer",
