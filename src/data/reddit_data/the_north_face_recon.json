        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1ee7y6k/north_face_surge_review/",
        "selftext": "tl;dr—Bought a North Face Surge backpack and like it.\n\nThough there are many reviews of the North Face Surge, I figured I’d share my recent experience with it. Using Reddit and YouTube was a great resource for me in choosing the bag, so hopefully this will offer some help for others in the future.\n\nI originally purchased an Osprey Nebula several weeks ago to replace my work backpack for commuting to the office a few days a week and also as a larger day pack to use while traveling (flying and walking around places like New York City). The Nebula was constructed very well, was extremely comfortable, and has Osprey's famous lifetime warranty. I ultimately returned it, as it had some quirks I didn't like after using it for a week or so. I didn't like the lack of organization for the admin functions (e.g., pens, notebooks), the compression straps covering the opening for the main compartment, and the location of the grab handle on top.\n\nAfter more research (mainly on here and YouTube), I opted for the North Face Surge. I initially thought I would get the Recon, since it's similar to the Nebula, but the Surge checked all of the boxes for me. The laptop/tablet storage is far better than the Nebula and Recon and the storage is far more plentiful. It's comfortable and fits me very well (I’m 6’4”), though the shoulder harness of the Nebula was more comfortable. The bottle holders on the sides of the Surge are far better than the Nebula and Recon (in my opinion). Aesthetically, the Surge is a fine-looking bag without looking ostentatious. I liked the look of the Nebula as well, but the function of the Surge was greater than the form of the Nebula. Many don’t care for the prominent TNF logo, and while I would appreciate it blacked out, it doesn’t bother me.\n\nSince I often carry a laptop or my iPad (2024 13” Air) in the bag, the laptop/tablet storage section was important to me. The storage section is suspended in the Surge and the Nebula, though I prefer the overall storage compartment on the Surge. As mentioned earlier, I didn't like how the compression straps cover the storage compartment. On the Surge, it's a traditional compartment, whereas the Nebula has a TSA-friendly clamshell design, though as someone who travels several times a year, I've never seen a need for this as most TSA checkpoints require the device to be taken out of the bag.\n\nRegarding the bottle pockets, the Surge has well-constructed and deep pockets that have elastic built in to the top of the pocket. The Nebula has compression straps on the bottom of the pockets, while nice they exist at all, I'd prefer they were at the top more like the Recon. I tested each bag with my Camelback 1,000 ml bottle, and the Surge held the bottle very well. When I travel, I always keep my bag underneath the seat in front of me, so I consider how well the bottle well stay in the pocket when doing so.\n\nThe Surge’s daisy chain webbing on the front with multiple connection points is a nice feature that was missing from the Nebula. I have a couple of S-biners attached that blend in with the bag, offering additional utility without looking like a tacticool bag.\n\nI like to have easy access to my phone, so I added a Matador Speed Stash Pocket to the strap. Though it is a bit large and breaks up the symmetry of the front design, it matches the bag quite well and serves to offer function over form.\n\nI did some minor customization to the bag as well. I added six additional zipper pulls to the zippers that didn’t have them. They’re OEM ones I received directly from the manufacturer, so now all of the zippers open as easily as the main two compartments that originally had them. I also added some elastic strap keepers to keep the extra portion of the sternum strap out of the way by folding it up and securing it.\n\nFinally, I added a small tomtoc electronic organizer to hold basic items (e.g., cables, battery pack). Essentially a compartmentalized Dopp kit, it works quite well and fits perfectly in the bottom of the main storage compartment.\n\nI’ve used the bag several times for commuting to the office, and it’s worked well. I recently got back from a trip, where I carried it through a couple of airports and used it as my personal carryon. It fit very well underneath the seat in front of me.\n",

For bigger people, the Surge is a great option. \nI’ve had a bad experience with the new Borealis; I returned it two times because the original one and the backup I got broke (zippers and the bungee cord). \nI really hope that this was just a fluke, maybe a bad batch because TNF is pretty renowned for their durability. \n\nBeen using an Opsrey Apogee for the last year now, but I’m selling it because it’s just a little too big and I’m not a fan of the main compartment zipper, the location compression straps, and the lack of external webbing/attachment points. I do have to say though that it is the most comfortable backpack I’ve used so far.",

            "body": "I followed the link you provided in the comments to my own review and see that you had very similar findings between the Surge and Nebula. Also, I love the tip about keeping S-biners clips on the daisy chain! That just solved my dilemma about how to carry my sandals when traveling and I no longer care that the Surge doesn't have an external mesh pocket. In fact, the daisy chain/carabiner combo is so much more versatile. \n\nI also didn't realize the tech compartment on the Nebula was designed as a clamshell for TSA compliance. I guess that makes sense. I couldn't figure out why one would want the tech compartment to be a clamshell design because they can be prone to opening while on the move if not fully zipped up. Also, if a clamshell is closed with both zippers on the bottom of one side there can be a small gap between the zippers that small items can fall out of. I do wish that the main compartment was a clamshell though, for when I fly Allegiant and use the backpack as my only luggage bag. Just easier to pack and unpack clothes.\n\nI agree that the water bottle compression straps on the Nebula are way too low. On 2 occasions I blindly slid my water bottle in thinking I had pushed it to the bottom below the straps, but because the straps were tight, the bottom of the bottle was just hitting the straps. This left the bottle only halfway in the pocket and it fell out after I swung the bag over my shoulder.\n\nI also agree that the grab handle of the Surge is more convenient and comfortable for picking up the bag, but I understood that the Nebula makes it bigger and puts it lower so that it can double as a loop to couple to a roller-bag's handle.  \n\nHere's the link to my review: [https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1erglgd/osprey\\_nebula\\_32\\_vs\\_north\\_face\\_surge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1erglgd/osprey_nebula_32_vs_north_face_surge/)",

        "selftext": "tl;dr—Bought a North Face Surge backpack and like it.\n\nThough there are many reviews of the North Face Surge, I figured I’d share my recent experience with it. Using Reddit and YouTube was a great resource for me in choosing the bag, so hopefully this will offer some help for others in the future.\n\nI originally purchased an Osprey Nebula several weeks ago to replace my work backpack for commuting to the office a few days a week and also as a larger day pack to use while traveling (flying and walking around places like New York City). The Nebula was constructed very well, was extremely comfortable, and has Osprey's famous lifetime warranty. I ultimately returned it, as it had some quirks I didn't like after using it for a week or so. I didn't like the lack of organization for the admin functions (e.g., pens, notebooks), the compression straps covering the opening for the main compartment, and the location of the grab handle on top.\n\nAfter more research (mainly on here and YouTube), I opted for the North Face Surge. I initially thought I would get the Recon, since it's similar to the Nebula, but the Surge checked all of the boxes for me. The laptop/tablet storage is far better than the Nebula and Recon and the storage is far more plentiful. It's comfortable and fits me very well (I’m 6’4”), though the shoulder harness of the Nebula was more comfortable. The bottle holders on the sides of the Surge are far better than the Nebula and Recon (in my opinion). Aesthetically, the Surge is a fine-looking bag without looking ostentatious. I liked the look of the Nebula as well, but the function of the Surge was greater than the form of the Nebula. Many don’t care for the prominent TNF logo, and while I would appreciate it blacked out, it doesn’t bother me.\n\nSince I often carry a laptop or my iPad (2024 13” Air) in the bag, the laptop/tablet storage section was important to me. The storage section is suspended in the Surge and the Nebula, though I prefer the overall storage compartment on the Surge. As mentioned earlier, I didn't like how the compression straps cover the storage compartment. On the Surge, it's a traditional compartment, whereas the Nebula has a TSA-friendly clamshell design, though as someone who travels several times a year, I've never seen a need for this as most TSA checkpoints require the device to be taken out of the bag.\n\nRegarding the bottle pockets, the Surge has well-constructed and deep pockets that have elastic built in to the top of the pocket. The Nebula has compression straps on the bottom of the pockets, while nice they exist at all, I'd prefer they were at the top more like the Recon. I tested each bag with my Camelback 1,000 ml bottle, and the Surge held the bottle very well. When I travel, I always keep my bag underneath the seat in front of me, so I consider how well the bottle well stay in the pocket when doing so.\n\nThe Surge’s daisy chain webbing on the front with multiple connection points is a nice feature that was missing from the Nebula. I have a couple of S-biners attached that blend in with the bag, offering additional utility without looking like a tacticool bag.\n\nI like to have easy access to my phone, so I added a Matador Speed Stash Pocket to the strap. Though it is a bit large and breaks up the symmetry of the front design, it matches the bag quite well and serves to offer function over form.\n\nI did some minor customization to the bag as well. I added six additional zipper pulls to the zippers that didn’t have them. They’re OEM ones I received directly from the manufacturer, so now all of the zippers open as easily as the main two compartments that originally had them. I also added some elastic strap keepers to keep the extra portion of the sternum strap out of the way by folding it up and securing it.\n\nFinally, I added a small tomtoc electronic organizer to hold basic items (e.g., cables, battery pack). Essentially a compartmentalized Dopp kit, it works quite well and fits perfectly in the bottom of the main storage compartment.\n\nI’ve used the bag several times for commuting to the office, and it’s worked well. I recently got back from a trip, where I carried it through a couple of airports and used it as my personal carryon. It fit very well underneath the seat in front of me.\n",

        "selftext": "tl;dr—Bought a North Face Surge backpack and like it.\n\nThough there are many reviews of the North Face Surge, I figured I’d share my recent experience with it. Using Reddit and YouTube was a great resource for me in choosing the bag, so hopefully this will offer some help for others in the future.\n\nI originally purchased an Osprey Nebula several weeks ago to replace my work backpack for commuting to the office a few days a week and also as a larger day pack to use while traveling (flying and walking around places like New York City). The Nebula was constructed very well, was extremely comfortable, and has Osprey's famous lifetime warranty. I ultimately returned it, as it had some quirks I didn't like after using it for a week or so. I didn't like the lack of organization for the admin functions (e.g., pens, notebooks), the compression straps covering the opening for the main compartment, and the location of the grab handle on top.\n\nAfter more research (mainly on here and YouTube), I opted for the North Face Surge. I initially thought I would get the Recon, since it's similar to the Nebula, but the Surge checked all of the boxes for me. The laptop/tablet storage is far better than the Nebula and Recon and the storage is far more plentiful. It's comfortable and fits me very well (I’m 6’4”), though the shoulder harness of the Nebula was more comfortable. The bottle holders on the sides of the Surge are far better than the Nebula and Recon (in my opinion). Aesthetically, the Surge is a fine-looking bag without looking ostentatious. I liked the look of the Nebula as well, but the function of the Surge was greater than the form of the Nebula. Many don’t care for the prominent TNF logo, and while I would appreciate it blacked out, it doesn’t bother me.\n\nSince I often carry a laptop or my iPad (2024 13” Air) in the bag, the laptop/tablet storage section was important to me. The storage section is suspended in the Surge and the Nebula, though I prefer the overall storage compartment on the Surge. As mentioned earlier, I didn't like how the compression straps cover the storage compartment. On the Surge, it's a traditional compartment, whereas the Nebula has a TSA-friendly clamshell design, though as someone who travels several times a year, I've never seen a need for this as most TSA checkpoints require the device to be taken out of the bag.\n\nRegarding the bottle pockets, the Surge has well-constructed and deep pockets that have elastic built in to the top of the pocket. The Nebula has compression straps on the bottom of the pockets, while nice they exist at all, I'd prefer they were at the top more like the Recon. I tested each bag with my Camelback 1,000 ml bottle, and the Surge held the bottle very well. When I travel, I always keep my bag underneath the seat in front of me, so I consider how well the bottle well stay in the pocket when doing so.\n\nThe Surge’s daisy chain webbing on the front with multiple connection points is a nice feature that was missing from the Nebula. I have a couple of S-biners attached that blend in with the bag, offering additional utility without looking like a tacticool bag.\n\nI like to have easy access to my phone, so I added a Matador Speed Stash Pocket to the strap. Though it is a bit large and breaks up the symmetry of the front design, it matches the bag quite well and serves to offer function over form.\n\nI did some minor customization to the bag as well. I added six additional zipper pulls to the zippers that didn’t have them. They’re OEM ones I received directly from the manufacturer, so now all of the zippers open as easily as the main two compartments that originally had them. I also added some elastic strap keepers to keep the extra portion of the sternum strap out of the way by folding it up and securing it.\n\nFinally, I added a small tomtoc electronic organizer to hold basic items (e.g., cables, battery pack). Essentially a compartmentalized Dopp kit, it works quite well and fits perfectly in the bottom of the main storage compartment.\n\nI’ve used the bag several times for commuting to the office, and it’s worked well. I recently got back from a trip, where I carried it through a couple of airports and used it as my personal carryon. It fit very well underneath the seat in front of me.\n",

For bigger people, the Surge is a great option. \nI’ve had a bad experience with the new Borealis; I returned it two times because the original one and the backup I got broke (zippers and the bungee cord). \nI really hope that this was just a fluke, maybe a bad batch because TNF is pretty renowned for their durability. \n\nBeen using an Opsrey Apogee for the last year now, but I’m selling it because it’s just a little too big and I’m not a fan of the main compartment zipper, the location compression straps, and the lack of external webbing/attachment points. I do have to say though that it is the most comfortable backpack I’ve used so far.",

            "body": "I followed the link you provided in the comments to my own review and see that you had very similar findings between the Surge and Nebula. Also, I love the tip about keeping S-biners clips on the daisy chain! That just solved my dilemma about how to carry my sandals when traveling and I no longer care that the Surge doesn't have an external mesh pocket. In fact, the daisy chain/carabiner combo is so much more versatile. \n\nI also didn't realize the tech compartment on the Nebula was designed as a clamshell for TSA compliance. I guess that makes sense. I couldn't figure out why one would want the tech compartment to be a clamshell design because they can be prone to opening while on the move if not fully zipped up. Also, if a clamshell is closed with both zippers on the bottom of one side there can be a small gap between the zippers that small items can fall out of. I do wish that the main compartment was a clamshell though, for when I fly Allegiant and use the backpack as my only luggage bag. Just easier to pack and unpack clothes.\n\nI agree that the water bottle compression straps on the Nebula are way too low. On 2 occasions I blindly slid my water bottle in thinking I had pushed it to the bottom below the straps, but because the straps were tight, the bottom of the bottle was just hitting the straps. This left the bottle only halfway in the pocket and it fell out after I swung the bag over my shoulder.\n\nI also agree that the grab handle of the Surge is more convenient and comfortable for picking up the bag, but I understood that the Nebula makes it bigger and puts it lower so that it can double as a loop to couple to a roller-bag's handle.  \n\nHere's the link to my review: [https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1erglgd/osprey\\_nebula\\_32\\_vs\\_north\\_face\\_surge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1erglgd/osprey_nebula_32_vs_north_face_surge/)",

It’s a perfect blend of durability, comfort, and organization, making it ideal for daily use, travel, and outdoor adventures.\n\n**What I love about it:**✅ **Comfortable Fit** – The FlexVent suspension system with padded shoulder straps and a breathable back panel makes carrying it for long hours a breeze. Even when fully loaded, it feels well-balanced and doesn’t strain my back.\n\n✅ **Spacious &amp; Well-Organized** – With multiple compartments, a laptop sleeve, and plenty of pockets, it easily fits all my essentials. The front stash pocket and side mesh pockets are super handy for quick access. Side waterbottel pockets (2x)\n\n✅ **Durable &amp; Weather-Resistant** – The high-quality materials and sturdy YKK zippers ensure longevity, and it holds up well even in light rain.Not waterproof!\n\n✅ **Versatile Use** – Whether I’m commuting,  or traveling, the Recon adapts to any situation. It’s compact enough for everyday carry but roomy enough for longer trips.(  from businesstrip to family holiday)\n\n⚠️ **Note:** The laptop sleeve is padded but **not fully suspended**, so extra care is needed when placing the backpack down on hard surfaces. Easy Fix- I use a litte of Bubblewrap at the bottom\n\nIf you’re looking for a **reliable, stylish, and functional backpack**, the North Face Recon is an excellent choice! Highly recommend. You can even match a kids Recon , so you have travel buddy\n\nBought it in 2022 for 90€ 👌🎒",

        "selftext": "So I got my first north face back in early 2019. So I’m not talking about models before 2018. Im sure the older ones were way better. This is strictly about the 2018 vs post 2021 bags. \n\nIt was the recon not the Borealis (the picture in this post isn’t mine) but I know that aside from the front pocket vs the strings they’re the same design on the inside. A few weeks ago I got the newer borealis one cause I always wanted the Borealis and regretted not getting that one in the first place and I wanted a newer bag to carry around for work (I got the recon for college initially and it was always super heavy to carry around honestly even with little things in it).\n\nI gotta say I enjoy this newer model much better! The material is lighter, less bulky, the pockets in the front are bigger, it’s exponentially easier to fit things in the main pocket! While the newer one still has some issue with the middle section kind of caving in (if you have one of these you know what I mean) it’s not nearly as bad as it was with my 2019 recon. I always had to make sure to put my bulky items in the bottom or nothing would fit. This newer bag (while still have a very slight issue with that) is much, much improved in my opinion. It’s also much more comfortable on me but that may just because it’s a lighter material. I’ve seen on this and other subs that people tend to hate the newer models of the north face bag and like the ones from 2018. But honestly the only thing i preferred about the older one was the water bottle pockets cause they were a little more flexible. Other than that i really prefer this newer model much more",

I compared it to the newer style recon and absolutely hate them. I treat it with loving kindness, because once it tears, it will be no more.

        "selftext": "So I got my first north face back in early 2019. So I’m not talking about models before 2018. Im sure the older ones were way better. This is strictly about the 2018 vs post 2021 bags. \n\nIt was the recon not the Borealis (the picture in this post isn’t mine) but I know that aside from the front pocket vs the strings they’re the same design on the inside. A few weeks ago I got the newer borealis one cause I always wanted the Borealis and regretted not getting that one in the first place and I wanted a newer bag to carry around for work (I got the recon for college initially and it was always super heavy to carry around honestly even with little things in it).\n\nI gotta say I enjoy this newer model much better! The material is lighter, less bulky, the pockets in the front are bigger, it’s exponentially easier to fit things in the main pocket! While the newer one still has some issue with the middle section kind of caving in (if you have one of these you know what I mean) it’s not nearly as bad as it was with my 2019 recon. I always had to make sure to put my bulky items in the bottom or nothing would fit. This newer bag (while still have a very slight issue with that) is much, much improved in my opinion. It’s also much more comfortable on me but that may just because it’s a lighter material. I’ve seen on this and other subs that people tend to hate the newer models of the north face bag and like the ones from 2018. But honestly the only thing i preferred about the older one was the water bottle pockets cause they were a little more flexible. Other than that i really prefer this newer model much more",

I’ve used it exclusively when visiting clients and needing to bring my laptop and everything else I need for demos and exhibitions. I have also used it to pack toiletries and a change of clothes for overnight stays while visiting clients. It has always been and will always remain one of my most favorite backpacks ever. I compared it to the newer style recon and absolutely hate them. I treat it with loving kindness, because once it tears, it will be no more. I have used it so much that the elastic in the water bottle nets on either side have stretched out to the point that they do not have any more elasticity left.",

Don’t soak and do what you can to minimize wet time. DO NOT scrub on wet interior coatings. Go easy on the outside. I use Zepp Citrus Degreaser for grease and oil stains. Oxyckean is good on coffee stains. Remember that detergents are not good for water repellent coatings. Something like Nikwax Tech wash is best if that is a concern. \n\nI hang the pack upside down to drip for a while and then gently towel off any excess water. Don’t rub the inside, just pat off the drips. I do press the foam outer padding with the towel to get more water out. I hang it upside down again with all the zippers open and turn it right side up the next morning to continue drying. I have an aquarium air pump with long hoses to get air down into the deep pockets (works great on shoes and boots too). Don’t hang in direct sun— UV is not your friend. \n\nIf the pack is already delaminated, smells like vomit inside or the coating is sticky, washing will probably peel the interior coating off. There’s nothing you can do with a sticky interior coating. I cut the hardware off for future repairs and landfill the leftovers.",

It's tasteful at least and not taking up 1/4 of the bag's outer face.\n* GORUCK - Very minimal branding, most of mine have the blank 2x3 velcro patch, but my EDC bag has a black leather patch sewn in, the bag is also black, so it's not super duper obvious\n* EVERGOODS CPL24 - No branding whatsoever beyond a small velcro panel that has their logo sort of embroidered in.

Other than that, I can't see why it couldn't keep functionally going for another 8 years. Not a single tear or any significant wear to be concerned about. Ogio know their shit 👍\n\nThe materials the Recon uses don't feel as strong so I don't think this will last as long.

I also appreciated that the bag is on the slimmer side and doesn't look so bloated. I also plan to make use of the orange loop points to tie up some shock cord when I need it.\n\nOn first impressions, I wish the side compression straps were higher to avoid the side pockets as I can't compress the side my bottle goes into and just compressing the opposite side makes the bag look too lopsided.\n\nI would have liked if the admin pocket zippers were a little easier to unzip one handed but it will be fine.\n\nI could have made use of maybe 1 more admin pocket somewhat like the new Surge has, but I wasn't willing to give up my front stretchy pocket. Also, the Surge isn't available here in Australia for some reason.\n\nI already knew this bag wasn't the best at standing on its own despite being better than previous iterations. It can if you pack it right and that's good enough for me. My previous bag couldn't at all so anything better than that is a nice bonus.\n\nLooking forward to using it as my EDC bag next week!",

Had it for over 11 years until I caught a bed bug in a hotel and had to leave it behind with my suitcase. It was falling apart a bit, lots of shedding and flaking of the inside material, but I absolutely loved it. \n\nDon’t know if I should just buy one of the recent TNF Recon backpacks or look for something else. Budget around $100 - hotel will pay to reimburse me. \n\nTried to find one on Mercari, eBay etc but all are super used and one of the few similar good condition ones I found is listed for like $250. \n\nNeed: mesh on the front as I am a pin collector and frequently swap them out. \n\nAlso surprised the new versions still don’t have a luggage strap?
