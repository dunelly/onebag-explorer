        "selftext": "As the post suggests I just got a new Tumi Hannah Backpack. Literally brought it home and dropped it in my garage. It has a light scratch, read online that Vaseline could help. Now it has a light scratch and very minor discoloration from the Vaseline. I know, I'm dumb. The question I have is, is it possible for me to fix it myself with a repair kit or something else? And the other question is if Tumi could repair it I know they have a good repair service and warranty. I'm pretty upset over this, the bag brand new was 600$ (I paid 300$ thank you Ross.) ",

Backpacks are backpacks, and they're going to get scratched. I would either not worry about this, or take it back (and they almost certainly won't notice).",
