It's really hard to explain. Luxurious, feels very \"quality\". I was on the fence about ordering it, but so glad I did. I do not regret at all.  \n  \nThis is my 4th TB Backpack. I also have Synik 22L (grey ballistic), Synik 30L (Nightwalk Halcyon), 30L Techonaut (black ballistic). \n\nIn my packing demo, in the main compartment I have 15\" ASUS Gaming Laptop in sleeve, CAP2, HLT2. Still extra room to cram more things in if needed. CAP1 in the bottom front pocket. This fit snuggly, no extra room. Side pocket held phone, wallet, edc pouch. Other side pocket held sunglasses, lotion, small travel towel. Both had extra room for smaller bits if needed. Center water bottle pocket fit perfectly my 18oz purist water bottle.\n\nTo note, my laptop (\\~14\"x10\"x1\") does not fit in the laptop compartment. I wasn't sure if it would. It does fit nicely in its sleeve in the main compartment, which suits me fine as I'm not a fan of the small access/side entry of the Syniks anyways. My laptop in its sleeve does not fit at all in the main compartment of my Synik 22L.",

The GR1’s main space is quite a bit bigger than the Synik’s main space even though it’s advertised at 26L compared to 30L for the Synik.

My daily switches between the two but these are very different in use and design. \n\nThe Tom Bihn has compartments and a more user friendly design with multiple zippers on the outside for storage and laptop options. The material design is better on your body IMHO, the internal frame and the straps don't fight your shoulders to sit when the bag is full. Combined with the internal slip sleeve, I can easily store my office go kit, or have access to my notebooks, pens without any issues. \n\nThe downside of the Tom Bihn is the design doesn't allow for customization or multiple use. The bag shape as an oval and rounded means the internal space is limited, especially for items that are taller (like 17\" laptops). The added materials for those pockets and sleeves make this bag feel very heavy when compared to the GR1. Also my biggest issue is their laptop sleeve design drops the laptop on the floor (which could have been easily solved by adding a false bottom). \n\nThe Goruck GR1 is a bucket bag like those roll tops but with a zipper clam shell design. It's great to customize your daily carry, but out of the box it's not great on pockets and organization like the Tom Bihn (or any other bag out there). But this is something unique about the GR1, unlike those bucket roll tops, there are not many square-ish bags out there that you can carry both a laptop very safe in a protected sleeve yet have this open space to customize. \n\nMy personal GR1 has the Tom Bihn sleeve inside to help hold the small items like notebooks and papers, then I use the mesh pocket internally to hold the cables, etc. This bag is also my daily bag as I carry a large 15\" usb monitor and something so flat doesn't fit well in the Tom Bihn. \n\nMy suggestion is to look at what you intend to use in either bag and go from there. If you want to keep the bag as a dedicated laptop and travel bag, both work, with the Tom Bihn edging out for the compartments. If you're looking at keeping a large space for filling with a set of clothes to travel, or maybe a box of tools, PC parts, anything, then I would consider the Goruck. \n\nHonestly, if you keep one and don't like it, both have a good resell market on eBay and other platforms so you won't lose much money.

It's like a magic bag that can hold everything you need.\n\nBut is that the only reason it's worth the premium price? Are there other fantastic features I might be missing?\n\nWhat do you like most about this bag? Any tips on how to get the best use out of it?",

The bag is dangerously stuffed full and survived a full school year so far and looks great. She has had a Timbuktu start coming apart in one year at the seams. A Thule bag didn’t make it 2 months. On those two bags, I spent more combined than on her synapse 25. I’m going to be impressed if this bag can take another year’s beating.",

When you divide the price you paid over that time frame, cost savings are put into perspective. \n\nI do love my Synik 30 but it is a divisive bag because of the shape. Some people like the shape and style. Others don't. Because of this, I find it often comes up on the secondary market (which is where I grabbed mine).\n\nA lot of TB bags are as close to buy-it-for-life type bags as they come.

I am just loving everything about it! \n\nThe only issues I have had with it are:\n1. I rest it towards walls often it and leaves a white mark on it, which goes away but is a bit weird in general for cleaning up.\n2. The bottom pocket is so big and I cannot fill it up, it makes the backpack sit a bit weirdly since all the top pockets are more full. \n\n",

One of the things I feel hasn't translated well from online to in-person, though, is its size—photos and video make the bag appear massive, especially compared to the Synapse 25 which it shares general dimensions with. In person, though, the Synik compares almost directly with my collection of North Face bags; in this case, a Surge in the middle and a Router to the right. In this photo, the Synik is packed with my EDC and the TNF bags are empty. It's still a large bag at 30L, but if you have the ability to try out the Surge and don't think it's too large for your frame then a Synik 30 should feel right as well. Hope that helps anyone trying to suss out the daily carry size of it.",

I don't feel like it would handle well as an \"oh shit, i have a bunch of extra shit to carry today\" bag -- however, i had tried the 30 as well and that one felt massive (made of ballistic nylon) on my 5'5\" frame. So, until Tom comes out with my dream 26L bag -- im going to take this as a personal challenge to minimize the amount of shit i carry every day. so far, so good.",

The extra space in the Synik is because there’s a wider gusset surrounding the main compartment side of the clamshell. So unless you’re using the main compartment more than the external pockets, I imagine the 22’s going to feel more like the 19 in daily use.",
