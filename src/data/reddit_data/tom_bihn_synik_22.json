The small version weighs only 1lbs 2oz and is rated for 28L. And the burnt orange is quickly becoming my fav neutral TB color, right after ursa.\n\nIt fit all my usual packing cubes that normally go into my aer tp2, and still had some room. \n\nUnsurprisingly, was lighter to carry, but very surprisingly, felt crazy light! one handed carry is so easy! \n\nAlso, needed something larger than my usual evergoods mhp sling for a large water bottle, light jacket, laptop, extra nice shoes, among other things. so brought along my summer companion, the synik 22 in rx30. \n\nNeedless to say, daytrippin with the synik was fantastic.\n\nBeen using this setup for several trips and already really loving this overall setup. cant wait to use it again.",

It’s my first Tom Bihn and I am very impressed with the material and build! \n\nBut the laptop compartment is a squeeze and I can barely fit in my 14” ThinkPad Carbon X1. I feel that the internal straps and waist straps are overkill for a bag this small although you can remove them. \n\nWish that there is one or two more pockets in the main compartments although the pockets on the front panel have good volume and lets me stuff different items in them. \n\nI can say the key feature that I am happy with is the luggage pass-through which is vertical and designed really well. Looking forward to bringing it in overseas trips soon. \n",

(I’m in Portland OR).\n\nI agree with you on all these points. \n\nWhile I really like the Spectron textile I find it a little visually loud combined with all the pocket seams and zipper pulls on such a small bag. And regarding the Synik itself (the bag design, not the Spectron), the Synik bells and whistles feel excessive for the small size as does the resulting weight compared to the Synapse 19/25 or Synik 26.\n\nI’m wishing I ordered the Synik 26 now but I had tried the Synapse 25 and it was way too big on me (5’2”), so I’d assumed the Synik 26 would also overwhelm me.\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m going to return the 22 sadly.\n\nDoes anyone know what the deal with extras and second runs is?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about the Spectron Synik 26 as people start using theirs!",

It’s my first Tom Bihn and I am very impressed with the material and build! \n\nBut the laptop compartment is a squeeze and I can barely fit in my 14” ThinkPad Carbon X1. I feel that the internal straps and waist straps are overkill for a bag this small although you can remove them. \n\nWish that there is one or two more pockets in the main compartments although the pockets on the front panel have good volume and lets me stuff different items in them. \n\nI can say the key feature that I am happy with is the luggage pass-through which is vertical and designed really well. Looking forward to bringing it in overseas trips soon. \n",

(I’m in Portland OR).\n\nI agree with you on all these points. \n\nWhile I really like the Spectron textile I find it a little visually loud combined with all the pocket seams and zipper pulls on such a small bag. And regarding the Synik itself (the bag design, not the Spectron), the Synik bells and whistles feel excessive for the small size as does the resulting weight compared to the Synapse 19/25 or Synik 26.\n\nI’m wishing I ordered the Synik 26 now but I had tried the Synapse 25 and it was way too big on me (5’2”), so I’d assumed the Synik 26 would also overwhelm me.\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m going to return the 22 sadly.\n\nDoes anyone know what the deal with extras and second runs is?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about the Spectron Synik 26 as people start using theirs!",

The material and construction is very, very high quality. The 22L is a perfect size for me, and can definitely use this as an EDC.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use it like I was planning to thanks to cancellations and travel restrictions.\n\nI was debating between the 22 and 30. Like you, I think the 22 would be perfect as a primarily EDC bag, but I ended up going for the 30 because I wanted a one bag travel pack. I had the Aer Travel Pack 2 small, but I think I enjoy the Synik much more. Disregarding the 2L difference in total capacity, the Synik just feels like it can hold more things because of the way the pockets are placed. I think both could fit about the same amount of things in their respective main compartments, but when fulled packed, the Synik seems like it's been able to fit more in the front pockets while the Aer's front pocket was basically already filled because of the stuff in the main compartment taking away volume from it.",

This one is surprisingly lightweight, comfortable on my back, and the quick-access pocket is phenomenal. The straps do have a tendency to twist around themselves excessively, and I sometimes struggle with the magnetic closure on the sternum strap, although maybe that’s just me 🤪 So far, it kinda feels like the bag that I “know” I’m going to keep, even though I’m going through the motions of all these comparisons",
