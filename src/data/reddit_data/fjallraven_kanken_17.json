My Lenovo ThinkPad t590 has a height of 36.5 cm, which doesn't fit in my normal Kånken, but the Laptop 15 is 40cm tall so I deciding to order both a 15 and a 17 to see for myself and thought I'd write a quick review about it for others wondering. \n\nFirst of all, I got the 15 in the no.2 version and I have to say that it's beautiful. This is the Deep Patina color and it's amazing. The hardware is really pretty and I'll definitely will look into a no.2 version if I ever want to replace my normal Kånken. I got the 17 in Frost Green which we all know and love.\n\nBoth bags have a pocket on the inside of the flap which I really like and think is missing from the normal bags. They also both have a seat pad, the no.2 has a bit of a more luxurious pad which is made of the same G-1000 material the bag is made of. \n\nNow for the measurements. My 15.6 inch laptop fits very comfortably in the laptop compartment of the 17 with room to spare. It does not fit in the compartment of the 15. However, it does fit well in the 15's main compartment. \n\nI'm a short person and to be honest, the 17 looks to me like I'm going to school for the first time with all my books in a bag that's too large for me. It's not a pretty look. I wanted to try to make the 15 version work and just put my laptop in the main compartment. I filled up the entre bag with daily stuff I bring to work and really liked how everything fit and I was convinced this was the way to go. Until I found out you can't add a chest strap to the bag since the shoulder straps are padded and there's no room to add the strap. Since my bag gets quite heavy with my daily gear/water/food and I need a chest strap to comfortable carry everything around I'm very sad to conclude neither of the bags will work for me. \n\nI hope this review helps anyone who's wondering about the Kånken Laptop bags. I'm not a native English speaker so please be kind about any mistakes.",

My Lenovo ThinkPad t590 has a height of 36.5 cm, which doesn't fit in my normal Kånken, but the Laptop 15 is 40cm tall so I deciding to order both a 15 and a 17 to see for myself and thought I'd write a quick review about it for others wondering. \n\nFirst of all, I got the 15 in the no.2 version and I have to say that it's beautiful. This is the Deep Patina color and it's amazing. The hardware is really pretty and I'll definitely will look into a no.2 version if I ever want to replace my normal Kånken. I got the 17 in Frost Green which we all know and love.\n\nBoth bags have a pocket on the inside of the flap which I really like and think is missing from the normal bags. They also both have a seat pad, the no.2 has a bit of a more luxurious pad which is made of the same G-1000 material the bag is made of. \n\nNow for the measurements. My 15.6 inch laptop fits very comfortably in the laptop compartment of the 17 with room to spare. It does not fit in the compartment of the 15. However, it does fit well in the 15's main compartment. \n\nI'm a short person and to be honest, the 17 looks to me like I'm going to school for the first time with all my books in a bag that's too large for me. It's not a pretty look. I wanted to try to make the 15 version work and just put my laptop in the main compartment. I filled up the entre bag with daily stuff I bring to work and really liked how everything fit and I was convinced this was the way to go. Until I found out you can't add a chest strap to the bag since the shoulder straps are padded and there's no room to add the strap. Since my bag gets quite heavy with my daily gear/water/food and I need a chest strap to comfortable carry everything around I'm very sad to conclude neither of the bags will work for me. \n\nI hope this review helps anyone who's wondering about the Kånken Laptop bags. I'm not a native English speaker so please be kind about any mistakes.",

This is the Deep Patina color and it's amazing. The hardware is really pretty and I'll definitely will look into a no.2 version if I ever want to replace my normal Kånken. I got the 17 in Frost Green which we all know and love.\n\nBoth bags have a pocket on the inside of the flap which I really like and think is missing from the normal bags. They also both have a seat pad, the no.2 has a bit of a more luxurious pad which is made of the same G-1000 material the bag is made of. \n\nNow for the measurements. My 15.6 inch laptop fits very comfortably in the laptop compartment of the 17 with room to spare. It does not fit in the compartment of the 15. However, it does fit well in the 15's main compartment. \n\nI'm a short person and to be honest, the 17 looks to me like I'm going to school for the first time with all my books in a bag that's too large for me. It's not a pretty look. I wanted to try to make the 15 version work and just put my laptop in the main compartment. I filled up the entre bag with daily stuff I bring to work and really liked how everything fit and I was convinced this was the way to go. Until I found out you can't add a chest strap to the bag since the shoulder straps are padded and there's no room to add the strap. Since my bag gets quite heavy with my daily gear/water/food and I need a chest strap to comfortable carry everything around I'm very sad to conclude neither of the bags will work for me. \n\nI hope this review helps anyone who's wondering about the Kånken Laptop bags. I'm not a native English speaker so please be kind about any mistakes.",

The tailor at my Fjällräven store agreed and she made the alterations in addition to adding the luggage passthroughs.\n\nI'm doing a quick weekend trip this weekend so I'm not packing it at full capacity, but the bag fits under the seat of an airplane and I haven't had any issues with wearing the backpack normally! I also just realized I now essentially have four \"holes\" I can clip things to on the outside of my Kanken when I don't have the Tree-Kanken Pocket attached.",

What is also kinda cool is the new stuff fits old bags, two years ago we bought strap pads and a water bottle pocket for a Kanken that my husband inherited from his Dad that was almost 40 years old. Still going strong!",

I got my Kånken Classic second hand and it was working out great as an EDC bag but when I packed it really full for travel, the straps dug into my shoulders. \n\nSince I missed having a laptop compartment, I upgraded to the Kånken No. Laptop 15”last year. It has built-in padded shoulder straps. But to my surprise, they didn’t work for me. The straps kept pulling away and off my narrow shoulders, something that never happens with my Kånken Classic. Adding a sternum strap likely would’ve solved the problem but there’s no place for the sternum strap to go on this model.The straps are sewn directly onto the padding with no gaps so the sternum strap accessory has no place to attach. I just couldn’t make the bag work for me so I sold it on Poshmark, from whence it came. \n\nI still use my Kånken Classic as an EDC but am thinking about taking it on my upcoming trip. I just wanted to find out how the shoulder strap and sternum strap accessories have worked out for others before investing in them. ",
