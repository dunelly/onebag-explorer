The large logo isn’t the best but I’ve heard that it’s easy to remove so I’ll see about that. Water bottle pockets are nice, don’t take up space and are tight so things don’t fall out. Interior space is nice and large and I’ve managed to fit a pretty decent amount of things inside. I might be blind but it seems like they removed the hydration hose pass through.  My only slight annoyance is that the top pocket is slightly inconvenient to use when the bag is packed to the top. If anyone’s got any questions about the bags I’m happy to answer them.",

Zero issues fitting it under the seats on a Ryanair 737 and also had enough space to stack my sling on top. \n\n\nPacking list:\n3 shirts-Patagonia responsibilitee long sleeve, Uniqlo airism short sleeve and another random Uniqlo shirt. \n2 pairs of trousers being the Patagonia Venga rock pants and Lululemon abc’s. \n1 pair of shorts:Patagonia strider pro shorts\n3 pairs of random underwear and 3 pairs of socks+ one extra of each worn on me whilst travelling. \n\nJackets: I brought my Patagonia nano puff, Arcteryx Beta LT and Lululemon sojourn windbreaker. The windbreaker was worn on me on the way there whilst the other two jackets were in the bag and on the way back the beta and nanopuff were worn. \n\nAside from that I brought my blunt umbrella which fit nicely in the bottle pocket, a headlamp and my tech pouch with chargers, adapters etc and also a 32oz Nalgene which fit nicely in the bottle pocket. Also picked up a copy of dune which was pretty thick and went into the laptop sleeve but didn’t cause any discomfort. \n\nI also managed to fit my Dji drone with the carrying case inside the bag with zero issues.\nSling was carried outside and has worked perfectly over the years. Overall there’s not really anything I’d change with the current setup and the black hole has taken everything I’ve thrown at it. Whether it’s daily use, travelling, hiking, climbing etc it’s worked perfectly. \n\nI’m happy to answer any questions/concerns/comments anyone might have. ",

I found one last bag on display at the store yesterday so I pulled the trigger it before leaving for my trip monday. The goal is to ideally one-bag this trip and have a bag that can fit under an Air Transat seat.\n\nBecause of its box shape I can definitely fit more into it, but its also making me realize just how comfortable my Osprey bag is for carrying heavier weight around. I usually use it for hiking or bringing my laptop + other stuff to work. Also a fan of having so many pockets easily accessible (front hip strap pockets, both side zip-up pockets, etc). \n\nThe Patagonia on the other hand, does not feel like it'll be easy on the shoulders for the long-haul, not does it have hip strap pockets. Though its infinetely better for keeping this organized/accessible once arrived at accomodations. We'll be staying at Casa particular's in a few cities/towns so will be on the move quite a bit.\n\nWhich would you take?",

I've been one-bagging out of a 22L bag I've had since high school and got to looking for a new bag after a recent international trip. ~~Spain was rough on it~~ Me in Spain was rough on it, but it's been with me daily for almost eight years now. In person I actually like the BH's finish...it's different and it's own vibe, especially in this navy/orange color pair 😘\n\nI've been searching for a bag that would triple for EDC, hiking, and minimal one-bagging. I wanted an Ultra Dragonfly, but I just can't afford it right now. The REI Rucksack 28 seemed like a good fit (especially when on sale), but after trying it I didn't like how it wore and the side pocket things.\n\nI was planning on waiting out for Black Friday to maybe grab a Mystery Ranch Catalyst 26 or the new Patagonia Black Hole 25L, but with retailers clearing out stock of the previous model of the BH, I thought I'd try it out. I'll test pack it with my packing list from Spain over the weekend, but I've clocked some miles today with it and I'm pretty happy with it.\n\nI'm 6'5\", so the height of the bag works well for me, and I love the slim profile. I'm concerned it's tall for flight travel, but I'm willing to risk it or just plan on using an old bag if I'm flying on a strict airline.\n\nHoping this is going to be a win for me 🤞 I previously invested in some ~~top notch~~ Amazon Basics packing cubes to help when traveling—though if you've got experience with this bag I'm open to packing cube suggestions!",

On paper, these are two very similar bags, and seem in a lot of ways to be pretty competitive (size, price, features).  Summary below:\n\n* **Looks:**  Cause we all care, right?  Well for me its the Patagonia hands-down.  I got the Smolder Blue, which is actually a dark grey with some contrasting black parts.  Not a fan of the huge lettering on it, but otherwise it looks slick, with contrast stitching and a general premium look.  The Gregory isn't bad, but not a fan of the slick looking, plasticky nylon panel on the front, and its a more bulbous unstructured shape.\n* **Materials:**  Patagonia easily wins again here.  Both use a large amount of recycled materials.  The Patagonia seems sturdier and more refined, and the main panels resemble X-Pac while being bit more flexible and quieter, while the Gregory is more typical nylon of bags of this (or even a lower) range.  The Gregory has a front panel, that while its does look generally waterproof, looks and feels very cheap (but nearly as bad looking as the previous shiny Black Hole material).  Overall I would say the Gregory does not feel like a $130+ bag. Both have great zippers, although the Patagonia's are a bit smoother (Gregory is YYK, but seem maybe too small for the pack).  Both have back panels that look good for airflow, but again the Gregory just looks/feels cheaper and I would be concerned with it snagging or generally not holding up as well.\n* **Size:**  Both are great, and wouldn't have concerns about be used for personal carry-on (except for some smaller Euro airlines, as both are hair over 18\" tall).  Main compartment on the Gregory seems much bigger though, with easier access\n* **Organization:** Gregory is the clear winner here.  Neither have a ton, but Gregory provides some nice features without overdoing it.  The vertical pocket has an internal mesh pocket to keep things a bit more organized, and few pens holders, and a few internal pockets.  It also has a top pocket with a nice felt lining (Patagonia is just more nylon).  The main compartment feels a bit Tardisy, as it seems huge, with a whipe open and easy access.  The Patagonia has literally nothing except one, kinda flimsy mesh pocket in the main (and only) compartment.  Which leads to, no separate laptop compartment on the Black Hole.  Usually not a big issue for me, but it hurts it here, especially since the one the Black Hole does have, is just sloppy and flimsy feeling.  With the lack of any frame, it also just makes things a bit challenging when packing fuller.\n* **Carry:**  Well here is where the Patagonia fails for me, and kinda hard.  It has no structure... at all. Essentially think of this bag as a duffel, with a decent harness system tacked on.  The back panel is simple, thin foam with no rigidity, or even particularly cushioned.  That means with anything in the pack (and especially in you don't have a laptop) it causes the back panel to bulge out and into your back.  Using one strap cause the whole bag to sag and bend along the back panel as well.  Both have great straps, although the Gregory's are a bit thicker and wider, but again has a cheaper feel with its mesh material.  Patagonia straps were also a bit more flexible, and more cushiony feeling.\n* **Misc:** Both have luggage pass-throughs, which is great.  However the Gregory, because it goes behind the rigid back panel, makes it a tight fit for large roller bag handles (my Travelpro roller handle barely fit, and was a bit of a fight to get it off.  The Patagonia pass-through handle has a bit a stretch, which is nice.  Both have external bottle pockets (Patagonia 2, Gregory 1).  Both nice a stretchy, but the Gregory has a bit more room.  A 32 oz Hydro would be pretty tight in the Patagonia.  The Gregory also has a side handle, which is pretty handy.\n\nOverall:  Well neither of these are keepers for me, which is sad because they are both so close.  The lack of a frame/structure in the Patagonia is a no-go for me, especially at that size (and price), and getting a duffel makes more sense.  A few extra pockets would also greatly help it out.  The Gregory is a much better designed bag in almost every way, but the materials just seem cheap and I would be worried about durability.  If it was an $80 bag I think it would be great, so maybe on sale?",

Even though the depth is claimed at 6\", mine measured 9\" when fully packed (frontier limit is 8\"). The width is totally fine even with a water bottle in the side pocket.

It's possible that a stitch or two were sewn just off the line of where it should have been, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's coming undone. If you're not ready to mail it in to us, then you should be okay to continue using it. If you notice it getting worse over time, then contact us and we can set up a warranty evaluation. \n\nOf course, if you want to get it taken care of before there's a greater issue or you plan to take a trip with it sometime this year, I recommend sending it as soon as you can.”",

It would probably squeak by with the larger US airlines with limits more like 18x14x8” or “fits under the seat.” \n\nOf course it’s the typical dice roll, “can I get by the gatekeepers” game. The way to maximize the space and remain  “legal” is getting the proportions just right. And it does vary by airline. EasyJet is 17.75 x 14.2 x 7.9”; Wizz air is 40 x 30x 20cm  ;same as RyanAir official size) and so on.\n\nUpdate: I just got back from a short trip and dumped the packing cubes and pouches from a very full 19 liter pack in the Tres and with it so loosely packed, it would fit the RyanAir sizer and no problem under a seat. There was actually room for a bit more. You're still on the frugal side things. I'm leaning more to an under pack bag for the comfort of it and it takes some discipline to resist packing it to a barrel shape.",

            "body": "The shape of the Tres Pack tapers noticeably from back to front.  Imagine a pyramid with the top two thirds missing.  That's the shape of the Tres Pack.  So the bag really doesn't hold as much as its dimensions might suggest.  On the plus side, the bag is light, nicely organized, and can be carried three different ways.\n\nAs for placing the bag under the seat in front of you, I'm sure it can be done, though it will protrude from under the seat.  On my latest Ryanair flight, the flight attendants didn't bat an eye over the 19\" Osprey Daylite Plus that the guy across the aisle from me had stowed underseat.  The only time I can see this being an issue is if you are in an emergency exit row.\n\nRegarding the ability to 'sneak' the bag into the overhead bins, I'm sure that can also easily be done.  I paid for the Priority fare but no one checked my boarding pass.  I can see how one could easily pay the standard fare and then simply place a bag in the first open overhead spot while navigating to his/her seat.\n\nIf you are looking for a bag that can be carried multiple ways like the Tres Pack and hold roughly the same amount, but meet the personal item size restrictions of most European domestic flights, the [Fjallraven High Coast Totepack](https://www.fjallraven.com/us/en-us/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/shoulder-bags/high-coast-totepack) is one to check out.  The down side of that pack is that it's really lightweight and not meant to be compared to a full featured EDC bag.  Also, the shoulder/crossbody strap is thin and unpadded ... but it's removable so it can easily be replaced.",
