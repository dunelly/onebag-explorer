        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go.

I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe.

I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it.

Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

I also enjoy that it can carry less than capacity and it still looks ‘full’. So you can just roll it down more so it looks smaller or just fill it up and roll. \nThe main drawback is the one compartment with little to no organisation. Most hiking packs are like this so it sounded like an easy part to overcome, however it was annoying when airport security had to bring everything out to check on something at the bottom, and this is the same when you have a small item that you also want to find (if you can’t find it by hand feel).\nYou do have to get creative with adding things to the bag, I have a mini hero clip on the carry handle and the umbrella in the water bottle/side pocket with the umbrella strap on the bags compression strap.\nI did come from the Aer Travel Pack 3 Small which was a bit overkill (for me) with the organisation as I like to put things in pouches, so this was and still is my perfect bag…. I think if the fjallraven had one more pocket on the outside (big enough for glasses unlike the existing key pocket) then it would be perfect although I am not sure where they could put this without impacting its simple looks - maybe even just a zip on top of one of the water bottle pockets so I could use it as a storage area.",

I went the ultralight route for awhile and learned from the discipline, but I think the most important question to ask is, “why am I going backpacking?” If it is to test yourself with the lightest gear load possible, great. If it is to enjoy and explore the wilderness, great. If it is the relax and be comfortable in the backcountry, great. These aren’t mutually exclusive reasons, but they will rarely align naturally. The quality of one’s backcountry experience is not necessarily measured in ounces, though too few or too many may well impact the experience. Nor, as you suggest, does one load-out work for all locations or weather conditions. Ultimately, remembering why I’m going backpacking has helped me balance weight and comfort, leading to greater enjoyment, and freed me from worrying about my base weight (it settles into a personally acceptable range eventually). Enjoy your journey!",

It’s intriguing how crafty innovations can facilitate wonderful experiences. I’ve camped in thunderstorms, swinging blissfully in my hammock all because of something clever like a rainfly. Personally, I can say those reasons regularly align. I love testing the limits of my gear, trying out new gear, getting outside with friends or myself, and also trying to tweak my load out in a way that modulates or augments my experiences. All in good fun. I find just as much satisfaction in the preparation as I do the summation. \n\nIt’s about the climb, not the peak ya know?",

I could have used those 5 extra litres that the v1 has, but I’ll get a bit creative with my packing as needed. It definitely has a lot of neat features, lots of pockets and organization, and a good feel to it. \nI decided against my my veeeeeeeery close second, Atlas Packs Adventure, because it was sadly $150 more expensive and had a longer wait time.

From cushy train travel in Europe to the local bus in the Indian Himalayas and weeks of motorcycle travel, I have spent about time with this pack to give a solid review. \n\nOverall Rating 8/10\nPros: \n-Rugged design and material \n-Many tie down points \n-Simple interior layout\n-Side pockets\n-Lightweight \n-Hideable waist strap \n-Comfortable\n-Suitcase style opening\n\nCons-\n-Top pocket eats into main pocket space \n-Poor back ventilation \n-Side pockets hard to reach when wearing pack\n-interior mesh pockets are almost useless. Could only fit very thin items like papers \n-locking zippers \n\nMy favorite part of this pack is the versatility. Fits carry on requirements, straps are good enough for long trekking days, and the many tie down points make it easy to throw onto a motorcycle.\nHighly recommend this pack as it’s a simple do it all. Perfect for one bagging!",

From cushy train travel in Europe to the local bus in the Indian Himalayas and weeks of motorcycle travel, I have spent about time with this pack to give a solid review. \n\nOverall Rating 8/10\nPros: \n-Rugged design and material \n-Many tie down points \n-Simple interior layout\n-Side pockets\n-Lightweight \n-Hideable waist strap \n-Comfortable\n-Suitcase style opening\n\nCons-\n-Top pocket eats into main pocket space \n-Poor back ventilation \n-Side pockets hard to reach when wearing pack\n-interior mesh pockets are almost useless. Could only fit very thin items like papers \n-locking zippers \n\nMy favorite part of this pack is the versatility. Fits carry on requirements, straps are good enough for long trekking days, and the many tie down points make it easy to throw onto a motorcycle.\nHighly recommend this pack as it’s a simple do it all. Perfect for one bagging!",

Side pockets are a bit lacking as well, although I like the internal access. \n\nI've never had issues with it as a carry-on (USA + SA), even when full.",

Here's my packing list:\n\n**Clothes**\n\n* **(2) Fabletics \"the-one\" short** \\-my favorite light, quick drying, zippable pocket shorts that I wear every day in the summer.\n* **Kuhl shorts** \\- nicer looking quick drying shorts still good for hikes n what not\n* **(3) T-shirts**\n* **(4) boxers** \\- aren't the tye die ones pretty\n* **(4) socks** \\- my Darn Toughs are unfortunately a 2 hour drive away.\n* **Long sleeve pullover** \\- was told it gets \"cold\" at night in Oaxaca but I'm from the UP of MI and drive on the highway when its 32F in the spring...I think I'll survive.\n* **6 panel hat** \\- it goes on my head.\n* **La Sportiva Hiking shoes** \\- my all in one shoe. I have hiked, bouldered, ran, and used them as bar shoes. They're not the most stylish but super comfy and versatile.\n* **Outdoor Research packable rain/wind jacket** \\- this is from my backpacking kit\n* **Jeans** \\- not shown but wearing on plane - there is room in the bag if I need to pack them\n\nI ended up ditching the orange stuff sack and just jamming it into the bottom of the bag because it you can compress better when its not constrained to the shape of the bag. Maybe I'll buy some packing bags in the future.\n\n**Toiletries**\n\n* **Toothbrush &amp; mini toothpaste &amp; floss sticks**\n* **Lotion** \\- I'm a very dry man\n* **Little deodorant** \\- so I don't get too smelly\n* **Pepto bismal tabs** \\- to combat Montezuma\n* **Bar of soap** \\- cut in half\n* **Conditioner** \\- Is better.

I need to get a reusable one though.\n* **Mini flashlight** \\- I probably won't use it but I like flashlights\n* **Sony Noise canceling ear buds**\n* **Wired earbuds -** for plane\n* **USB-C to USB-C phone cord and brick**\n* **USB - USB-C cord** \\- short\n* **USB - USB-C adapter**\n* **Aux cord** \\- for the rental car\n\n**EDC**\n\n* Wallet - small single piece of leather\n* Sunglasses - its bright out yo\n* Pixel 5a - not shown\n\nIt all fits in the bag no problem with even a little room to spare which is good because I want to buy some rad shirts in Oaxaca.\n\nI'll post a bag/gear review after the trip!",

            "body": "My first attempt at posting this got auto-deleted and my second attempt was over the character count. Third time is a charm, maybe!\n\nWe recently returned from a two-week trip in Ireland with our toddler, and we wanted to share our approach to let other folks with kids know that one-bagging with toddlers is not only doable, but preferable — Given Air Canada's ability to be absolutely awful, we anticipated issues (and were proven correct), and one-bagging was a lifesaver for us on this trip.\n\n**Background**:\n\nI'm an experienced one-bagger, having traveled this way since I was 19 (nearly 40 now). We typically travel with camping via 4x4, so this was our first family trip via airline. This trip to Ireland was a multi-generational affair, involving grandparents and my sister's family.\n\nI recently upgraded from a Mountain Hardware Heuco 35 (which was losing integrity at the seams) to a Mystery Ranch Coulee 30, and my wife used the Osprey Archeon 30. We picked these bags because of their ease of access, size, and durability, but both are worthy of a post on their own so I won't say more other than: I would buy the exact pack again in a heartbeat and so would my wife. Our son had a roller case and a small backpack (small backpack breaks the \"one bag\" thing, but it would fit in the case - he just wanted to be like mom and dad!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Packing Philosophy:**\n\n* Pack for a week and you can travel indefinitely.\n* Be totally independent in our packs - in an emergency or if we got separated, we have everything we need with us individually at all times to not only survive but be comfortable.\n* Versatility: Beach to the Bush to the Boardroom, we didn’t want to miss out on anything because we lacked the right clothing or equipment.\n\n**Packing List:**\n\nWe used Taskin compression packing cubes - loved these things. Good compression, and a separate section for clean/dirty made keeping things organized very easy. Here’s what I had in mine:\n\n**Large**:\n\n* Two dress shirts, one technical shirt (Ex Officio) - one worn.\n* Two pants - dress pants and jeans, one worn.\n* Base Layer shirts (Helly Hanson Polypropylene &amp; True North Merino Wool) - one worn.\n* Two cotton t-shirts - one plain, one graphic.\n\n**Medium**:\n\n* 4 pairs of Ex Officio Give and Go underwear.\n* 4 pairs of Merino socks from Costco.\n* 1 pair of swim shorts.\n* 1 camp towel.\n\n**Toiletry Kit** \\- REI brand Dopp kit, had it for 10+ years.\n\n* Toothbrush, paste, floss\n* moisturizer\n* basic first aid\n* medications\n* beard brush\n* hair product\n* tweezers\n* nail clippers\n* Q-tips.\n\nElectronics in Eagle Creek kit:\n\n* 35 Watt USB C power brick (Came with MacBook Air)\n* Cable for Phone, Computer, AirPods, and Watch\n* Spare AAA batteries for headlamp,\n* Dongle for MacBook Air (USB &amp; HDMI)\n* Presentation remote\n* Battery pack\n\nMacBook Air in a Finpac hard sleeve case. Also brought a travel adapter.\n\n**Outerwear:**\n\n* Woods rain jacket\n* Paradox packable Puffer coat\n* North Face mid-layer.\n\n**Hip Belt Pockets:**\n\n* Garmin In-Reach\n* Headlamp\n* Straps.\n\n**Misc:**\n\nLifestraw, grey scarf. EDIT: Also forgot to mention the black rectangle - that’s my ticket/passport folio; I travel with two passports and I keep a few pens and my wedding ring in there. I also kept my son’s passport while my Wife kept her passport in her electronics kit.\n\nSECOND EDIT: Forgot to mention the ziplock. It had some masks, some lysol wipes, and some Cottonel wipes, and some hand sanitizer and tide. We used the masks on the flight there to avoid any unwanted bugs, and wiped down our tray tables and arm rests with the lysol as soon as we sat down.\n\n**Other:**\n\nOur son's dinosaur case contained all his necessities, including an iPad, Switch, toys, and clothing - including overnight diapers as he's still learning. My wife’s bag had different specific items, but generally mirrored the above (she had way more outfit combinations than I did - I can ask her to post her stuff if folks are interested in specifics, lots of layers and pieces that could mix and match for a total of about 15 outfits for her for all occasions).\n\nThis one-bag method was a game-changer, especially during Air Canada's challenging service on our return trip - delays happen, but AC’s policies and poor service meant we were in transit for over 35 hours without sleep. Our toddler was amazing, but we credit that to one-bagging as we had everything we need to be self sufficient.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything - and no, I’ll never fly AC again; if that’s the only option I’ll walk! - but I’ll continue to one-bag it for life, especially with my family, as I think it simplifies one of the greatest experiences a person can have - travel - in a huge way.",

            "body": "My first attempt at posting this got auto-deleted and my second attempt was over the character count. Third time is a charm, maybe!\n\nWe recently returned from a two-week trip in Ireland with our toddler, and we wanted to share our approach to let other folks with kids know that one-bagging with toddlers is not only doable, but preferable — Given Air Canada's ability to be absolutely awful, we anticipated issues (and were proven correct), and one-bagging was a lifesaver for us on this trip.\n\n**Background**:\n\nI'm an experienced one-bagger, having traveled this way since I was 19 (nearly 40 now). We typically travel with camping via 4x4, so this was our first family trip via airline. This trip to Ireland was a multi-generational affair, involving grandparents and my sister's family.\n\nI recently upgraded from a Mountain Hardware Heuco 35 (which was losing integrity at the seams) to a Mystery Ranch Coulee 30, and my wife used the Osprey Archeon 30. We picked these bags because of their ease of access, size, and durability, but both are worthy of a post on their own so I won't say more other than: I would buy the exact pack again in a heartbeat and so would my wife. Our son had a roller case and a small backpack (small backpack breaks the \"one bag\" thing, but it would fit in the case - he just wanted to be like mom and dad!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Packing Philosophy:**\n\n* Pack for a week and you can travel indefinitely.\n* Be totally independent in our packs - in an emergency or if we got separated, we have everything we need with us individually at all times to not only survive but be comfortable.\n* Versatility: Beach to the Bush to the Boardroom, we didn’t want to miss out on anything because we lacked the right clothing or equipment.\n\n**Packing List:**\n\nWe used Taskin compression packing cubes - loved these things. Good compression, and a separate section for clean/dirty made keeping things organized very easy. Here’s what I had in mine:\n\n**Large**:\n\n* Two dress shirts, one technical shirt (Ex Officio) - one worn.\n* Two pants - dress pants and jeans, one worn.\n* Base Layer shirts (Helly Hanson Polypropylene &amp; True North Merino Wool) - one worn.\n* Two cotton t-shirts - one plain, one graphic.\n\n**Medium**:\n\n* 4 pairs of Ex Officio Give and Go underwear.\n* 4 pairs of Merino socks from Costco.\n* 1 pair of swim shorts.\n* 1 camp towel.\n\n**Toiletry Kit** \\- REI brand Dopp kit, had it for 10+ years.\n\n* Toothbrush, paste, floss\n* moisturizer\n* basic first aid\n* medications\n* beard brush\n* hair product\n* tweezers\n* nail clippers\n* Q-tips.\n\nElectronics in Eagle Creek kit:\n\n* 35 Watt USB C power brick (Came with MacBook Air)\n* Cable for Phone, Computer, AirPods, and Watch\n* Spare AAA batteries for headlamp,\n* Dongle for MacBook Air (USB &amp; HDMI)\n* Presentation remote\n* Battery pack\n\nMacBook Air in a Finpac hard sleeve case. Also brought a travel adapter.\n\n**Outerwear:**\n\n* Woods rain jacket\n* Paradox packable Puffer coat\n* North Face mid-layer.\n\n**Hip Belt Pockets:**\n\n* Garmin In-Reach\n* Headlamp\n* Straps.\n\n**Misc:**\n\nLifestraw, grey scarf. EDIT: Also forgot to mention the black rectangle - that’s my ticket/passport folio; I travel with two passports and I keep a few pens and my wedding ring in there. I also kept my son’s passport while my Wife kept her passport in her electronics kit.\n\nSECOND EDIT: Forgot to mention the ziplock. It had some masks, some lysol wipes, and some Cottonel wipes, and some hand sanitizer and tide. We used the masks on the flight there to avoid any unwanted bugs, and wiped down our tray tables and arm rests with the lysol as soon as we sat down.\n\n**Other:**\n\nOur son's dinosaur case contained all his necessities, including an iPad, Switch, toys, and clothing - including overnight diapers as he's still learning. My wife’s bag had different specific items, but generally mirrored the above (she had way more outfit combinations than I did - I can ask her to post her stuff if folks are interested in specifics, lots of layers and pieces that could mix and match for a total of about 15 outfits for her for all occasions).\n\nThis one-bag method was a game-changer, especially during Air Canada's challenging service on our return trip - delays happen, but AC’s policies and poor service meant we were in transit for over 35 hours without sleep. Our toddler was amazing, but we credit that to one-bagging as we had everything we need to be self sufficient.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything - and no, I’ll never fly AC again; if that’s the only option I’ll walk! - but I’ll continue to one-bag it for life, especially with my family, as I think it simplifies one of the greatest experiences a person can have - travel - in a huge way.",

        "selftext": "I’m not a true one-bagger since I bring along a carryon bag and a personal item backpack. For years I had been carrying a basic Timbuk2 18-20L backpack but recently upgraded to this REI 28L bag, women’s size (half off from the recent sale). \n\nI just took it on a domestic trip and loved it. The reason I wanted a new bag (I’m a buy it for life kind of person) was because the older bag was just slightly too small to accommodate shifting packing when I would buy anything on a trip and it was getting uncomfortable because it didn’t have any real additional support (like chest or waist strap). This bag had just enough organizational pockets, one of them being the top pocket which was so easy to grab stuff from when the bag was stowed beneath the seat during the flight. I’m not tall, less than 5’2”, so it wasn’t in my way when tucked in the seat in front of me. I read older reviews of the bag that said the laptop sleeve went all the way to the bottom so your computer would hit the floor but it’s been changed and there are a couple inch gap. The top strap can also be used as a carryon pass through strap! \n\nOverall, happy with this upgrade (especially since I got a great deal on it). Can’t wait to take it on an international trip! ",

        "selftext": "Hello r/onebag! I recently made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1dxqbiv/aer_travel_pack_3_xpac_long_term_review/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) about my Aer TP3 and some alternatives I have been considering, one of them being the updated REI Ruckpack 40L ([this thing](https://www.rei.com/product/235558/rei-co-op-ruckpack-40-pack-mens)). Making this post to provide some information and pictures since it's new and, at the time of writing this, not yet in stores for people to try out.\n\n# Impressions\n\nFor reference, I shop at REI a lot, but the only other bag I own is an older version of their Flash 22. I view REI branded gear much like I view the Kirkland brand from Costco: reliable, solid, nothing flashy. I think this bag lines up with those expectations. Just like in my other review, I'll skip over the specs since that information is online. Here are some scattered thoughts:\n\n* I got the iron oxide color and it looks darker than it does on the website. Definitely reminds me of rust, while the website looks almost \\_red\\_.\n* Harness system feels good. I loaded up my bag and moved around the house for about 30 min and didn't feel fatigued. Certainly not as good as TP3's harness system, but that's totally fine for my use case.\n* There are some additional mesh compartments inside the main bucket that give just enough organization for random knick knacks. I attached some pictures of it since it's not shown on the website listing.\n\nOverall, I'm liking the bag, since the main thing I'm looking for is a ginormous bucket. Leave any questions below and I'll try to answer them.\n\n[Darker red than what I see on the website](https://preview.redd.it/3ct5vwsa7ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596b95d74911f4903973a23dc01b796cd60f49ef)\n\n[Top flap pocket not shown on listing](https://preview.redd.it/6mq03gcb7ebd1.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70fac7bbf0bf59a064f2a04ceefe8f07f4c0d189)\n\n[Big main bucket, 3.5L Bellroy Toiletry Kit Plus for reference](https://preview.redd.it/524nw6yb7ebd1.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e09301cfc5ebeb082260022c2e2b0b3b26a4daf9)\n\n[Mesh pockets](https://preview.redd.it/xnazhfhc7ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=095bf3e76741762108e1098ff8212dda59e40606)\n\n[3.5L + 13L + 4.5L cubes](https://preview.redd.it/nnkzaj4d7ebd1.jpg?width=955&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c89ad36cfd834f388e8ba5fe8a4d125a9fa2a67b)\n\n[After zipping up, depth-wise, there is still enough space to shove a pair of shoes or Sony XM5 headphones case like I did](https://preview.redd.it/ev00h0ud7ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd1596ecce68baae8a2118f426a2fd70856f2c4b)\n\n[What the harness system looks like zipped up](https://preview.redd.it/w6hbhgl98ebd1.jpg?width=1696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91d935cbeb91416e032578fbd2afa728be3435ef)\n\n",

        "selftext": "Yes, backpacks in the picture are of different kinds/purposes, but these are the most illustrative pictures to my question that I managed to find. \n\nPicture on the left. That’s, from my understanding, the most comfortable way to wear a backpack: tight to the body and somewhat high, so the weight pushes on shoulders from the top rather than pulling them back. Ignore the hip belt for now.\n\nPicture in the middle. Same idea, but the pack is half the size of the previous one, so its top part is lower, while it sits still high. Keep ignoring the hip belt. \n\nPicture on the right. And that is how I see majority of backpacks pictured being worn, except for big backpacking ones. Pack sits lower, straps pull shoulders back, making pack lean away from body and sit even lower, which in turn pull shoulders even further back and so on.\n\nI don’t find the third pictured way of wearing backpack comfortable. At all. Unless it’s very light and I’m carrying for a short period of time, then it’s okay, not great, just okay. Carrying heavier or longer makes me want to pull backpack closer and tighter (I guess, that’s because I’m trying to make load push down on my shoulders and not pull back). To make it sit more comfortably, I end up pulling it so high, that shoulder straps start to rub against my neck and upper traps. Also, that makes straps move apart and kinda sit in armpits; to prevent that I tighten chest strap, which pulls straps closer, putting even more side pressure on the neck.\n\nBackpacks I’m currently dealing with (and looking to possible update because of the reason above) are REI Ruckpack 18L and 28L. Aer Travel Pack 2 has pretty much the same issue but aided a little by having a waist belt, though not a lot. \nI do lift and have broad shoulders but by no means a big guy at 180lbs and 6ft. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? And how do I fix it?",

            "author": "gabek333",
            "body": "I used to work at REI so let me give a rundown of how to properly wear a backpack.\n\nSo first off, hiking bags and travel bags are made differently. Hiking bags are designed to be worn for long stretches of time and while walking. Travel bags are more convenient for packing (clamshell open vs. top loading) but are not designed to be worn for as long because the assumption is that you will put your bag down on a plane/bus/etc.\n\nThe features reflect this. Every single hiking backpack has (or should have) load lifters. If you look at the middle and left pictures, it's the little adjuster strap between the top of the back and the shoulder strap. These straps pull the upper part of the bag closer to your upper back. Hiking bags also have burly hip belts to evenly distribute weight to the legs and take the stress off of your back and shoulders. The shape is also usually designed to hug your back and therefore is curved to match your spine.\n\nMost of these features would be great on travel bags, but they aren't super practical. The burly hip belt on backpacking bags flops around and cannot really but put away. The curve of the bag is definitely not conducive to carrying laptops. The top loading is challenging for organization on a trip in a city. Even load lifters add weight and dangling straps. Most travel bags have chest straps in lieu of the other features. The chest straps keep your bag from sliding out to your outer shoulders, helping your back. Maybe try loosening the chest strap to where it's comfortable?\n\nThe reality is, though, that most bags of any style under 30 liters don’t usually have the hiking features because they become a little unnecessary. If the bag is light, there's not much of a need to have the fit be absolutely perfect. I think at 18 liters, those features are excessive. But at 28? Maybe find a bag with those features? Ask yourself if you'd rather have a better carrying experience or organizational experience because you usually sacrifice one.\n\nThe [Osprey Porter 30](https://www.rei.com/product/171302/osprey-porter-30-travel-pack) has load lifters, but I'm not a huge fan of the bag. The [Cotopaxi Allpa 28](https://www.cotopaxi.com/products/allpa-28l-travel-pack?variant=40467748519997) has those features as well, but reviews are mixed on the bag. Maybe go try it on?\n\nFor any hip belt, you ideally want the top of your hips to be in the middle of the hip belt. Everyone's hips are at different heights so find where yours are. They're usually higher than you expect (a bit higher than where most people wear pants), and usually around the belly button. With the hip belt in the right place, the shoulder strap should be flush with your shoulder (and not have space below). Actually, in the picture on the left, the strap/height of the bag should be adjusted a little bit haha.\n\nI think the first thing you should do is play with your chest strap to find a way where it doesn't cut into your neck. I've found that with my 30L Tom Bihn Aeronaut that I can wear the back for very long stretches (not quite as long as my hiking bags for when I backpack in the backcountry) and it's mostly because that bag rocks and the frame sheet/chest strap keep the bag structured and in place.\n\nIf the chest strap just doesn't work, you probably just need to find a bag with a real hip belt. Don't settle for webbing, that does absolutely nothing. You need a strap at least two fingers in width to transfer weight to your hips and ideally, you would have a rigid frame on the bag as well.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, hope this helped.",

                "body": "Thank you! This is an amazing reply that helps and clarifies a lot. \n\nMy question... rather my situation is I walk a decent amount (10 to 20km) almost daily. Either in the city or national parks; no wilderness and survival. My load is compact but dense, basically camera gear and water. Most of the time I carry light (\\~2.5kg) and it takes very little space (3-4L) plus water. And occasionally need to carry heavier but still under 30L volume for sure. I don't do anything extreme but go off beaten paths regularly. \n\nSo I want a backpack that I'll carry daily and that will be very comfortable :) And it seems to me more and more that I need a fully featured hiking style one. But carrying 4L load in a 30L or even 20L backpack looks questionable. \n\nWhat would be your advice?",

The logic \"tighter more secure\" might make sense, but in reality It will increase pressure fully on your shoulder muscles. Your body will compensate by leaning forward because of all the weight, &amp; now your whole posture is off balance and will hurt in the long run.\n\nGet the weight off your shoulders, onto your hips. Use the chest/sternum strap to \"float\" your pack off your shoulders. This may result in the top leaning back slightly, but again, you will naturally lean forward. The heavier the pack, the more it's about finding the balance of it all to get the most comfort.",

I need to choose it without being there as I’m meeting my friend at a conference and she will bring one for me to bring home. I’ve tried the REI Trail 25 on in-store and found it incredibly comfortable. I’m worried it’s a bit delicate and not waterproof enough for living in the rainy Northwest of Lancaster/Cumbria. The Gregory Resin looks a little “smarter” for going to conferences and is more likely to help me out in rain. Because I’ve one-bagged with as much as 20 lbs that needs to be taken into account as well (also need to just carry less). \n\nCrucial to me is the sternum strap, some back/shoulder paddding on straps etc, a water bottle pocket, and a large main compartment to take packing cubes/bags. My usual bag is a black Osprey Porter 30 but it’s too “cinched down” for every day use and no water bottle pocket. It also looks too big on some of the airlines I’ve brought it as my personal bag.",

That’s the point where I would shift to a pack that has a true load transferring harness and comes in a torso size that fits properly. That’s where the Osprey Farpoint and Mystery Ranch Scree 32 work well.",

Never check the water-resistance, mainly because I never use it for anything that’s critical for staying dry. I’d say just use a plastic liner if you’re worried about it. \n\nEither way, great bag. Wouldn’t say it’s worth the full asking price, I’d wait until REI runs one of its many sales to grab one. \n\nFor that matter I think the Resin may still be on sale in the outlet section of the REI website",

I tried the 26 as well and it was a bit too big (stuck out from my back too far). I like using the Resin 24 since I can pull out my packing cubes and use it as a daypack when I reach my destination. Main compartment is huge and just a giant bucket so you can fit a lot in there! The exterior is very durable and water resistant (haven't tried it in a downpour, but it's fine for drizzles I'd imagine). Fits under the seat of any airline I've tried.\n\nIt's very comfortable for regular usage and walking around (10 mile days, including many miles fully packed on the way to/from the airport). Wasn't as comfortable to use when biking, but I didn't get it for that purpose. The back panel has ventilation so my back stayed dry. It fits under the seat on airlines and the way it zips up with the gussets helps compress your stuff even more. I've taken it to Alaska, Michigan, and Minneapolis so far. Haven't tried the Trail 25, but the Resin 24 checked all of my marks!\n\nOne note is that I don't usually bring a laptop, so I wanted a bag with minimal laptop space but that still had a compartment just in case. With a laptop it would get a bit more snug inside but the laptop would be right next to your back which is nice for weight distribution. Good luck!",
