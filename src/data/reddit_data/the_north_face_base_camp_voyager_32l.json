I decided to post about this bag here, because I could not find this specific model on reddit yet.\n\nThe Voyager Rolltop is made off of a water resistant fabric which prevents anything inside from getting wet. This fabric also makes the bag look distinctively North Facy, which I like. I would not be exaggerating if I called this bag the transformer, since it can go from relatively slick looking to huge, depending on how much stuff you put into it.   \n  \nI have been using it daily for more than a year now. I've carried two laptops, a tablet, some books and 1.5L water bottle with me this whole time and the bag is not showing signs of aging. Some might find the lack of space for organization as frustrating, but I prefer this style now, since it is easy to stuff bigger objects, such as clothing, into this open-spaced type bag.\n\nIt can be used for various purposes. I myself use it daily for school/office. Furthermore, I occasionally take it with me as the only luggage while traveling for a few days across Europe. \n\nThings to be aware off: The rolltop version does not seem to be sold in the US. I personally don't roll it up and leave it as it is shown in the first picture. The bag buckles can be tightened quite well, so I do not worry about someone grabbing inside of it or it getting wet inside while it is raining",

I decided to post about this bag here, because I could not find this specific model on reddit yet.\n\nThe Voyager Rolltop is made off of a water resistant fabric which prevents anything inside from getting wet. This fabric also makes the bag look distinctively North Facy, which I like. I would not be exaggerating if I called this bag the transformer, since it can go from relatively slick looking to huge, depending on how much stuff you put into it.   \n  \nI have been using it daily for more than a year now. I've carried two laptops, a tablet, some books and 1.5L water bottle with me this whole time and the bag is not showing signs of aging. Some might find the lack of space for organization as frustrating, but I prefer this style now, since it is easy to stuff bigger objects, such as clothing, into this open-spaced type bag.\n\nIt can be used for various purposes. I myself use it daily for school/office. Furthermore, I occasionally take it with me as the only luggage while traveling for a few days across Europe. \n\nThings to be aware off: The rolltop version does not seem to be sold in the US. I personally don't roll it up and leave it as it is shown in the first picture. The bag buckles can be tightened quite well, so I do not worry about someone grabbing inside of it or it getting wet inside while it is raining",

I took 4 tees, one pant, one short, one bath towel, 4 underwear and 4 set of socks in a peak design medium packing cube. My camera gear in a peak design 6L sling bag. It fits them a bit tight with the packing cube squished. It’s got a padding for the laptop compartment and really nice cushion padding for the back. Lot of loops for carabiners and straps and the bag can stand on its own. So far, my only issue with this bag is that the padding in the laptop compartment is some hard plastic, so it’s not possible to compress the height of the bag. The opening is wide enough but it would have been great if it had a clamshell opening. \n\nLet me know if you guys got any questions.",

        "selftext": "Recently, my backpack needs changed, so I started looking for a new one. I ended up with The North Face Voyager Daypack 26L and have been really happy with it. Since there aren’t many reviews, I thought I’d share my experience.\n\nI chose the 26L version because I needed a bag that could carry my work gear, a chunky laptop, tablet… as well as some spare clothes and essentials for 1–3 day trips (usually by train). Since these are short trips, I don’t optimize for ultralight packing, and I usually have space left over for a book or jacket.\n\nThe dimensions are pretty true to size (I measured roughly 47cm x 30cm x 17cm when not fully packed). The laptop compartment is great, the front has solid internal organization, and the middle is just a big open space for other items. There’s also space for a large bottle on either side of the backpack.\n\nThe main critiques I’ve seen:\n\t1.\tShoulder straps being close together: True, I guess (see pic), but they feel really comfortable to me.\n\t2.\tZippers not being waterproof: A real shame, especially since the rest of the materials are durable and water-resistant.\n\nTo me, this backpack strikes a pretty unique balance between functionality, comfort, and design. It works well in both professional and more adventurous settings, feels great to carry whether fully packed or half-empty, and has just the right amount of storage options for my needs.\n\nI’ll be using this bag for longer trips in the future, swapping work gear for more clothes and stress-testing the capacity even more. I’d love to do a follow-up review when that happens!",

        "selftext": "I’ve been searching for a new daily commuter bag and finally pulled the trigger on a The North Face Voyager 26L daypack in New Taupe Green.\n\nThe bag seems great so far and essentially mimics the Aer City Pack Pro (without the clam shell) which was my main preference. Unfortunately in Canada the CPP is $340 Canadian plus shipping and any duty fees, whereas TNF voyager was $162 (with 10% off signup code) and free shipping from Altitude Sports.\n\nEither that being said, my only gripe is that the bag seems a bit big for a daily carry. My previous bag pictured was a Herschel tech daypack 25L. The voyager is 1 liter bigger at 26, but seems like a huge difference. Any thoughts on commuting (by bike) with this size? Does it seem like overkill? I typically only carry lunch, laptop, water bottle, sometimes a thermos, and a multi tool, possibly a light coat.\n\nIf anyone has any questions on the bag let me know.",

            "body": "I took a short trip using my North Face Voyager Base Camp. 42L.  \n\nWhile it’s technically too big, it fit so easily in the overhead (I was on a 737) and I also shoved it under my seat no problem (It’s first class—my work is paying for the trip).  The bag was lightly packed, and it looks about 1/2 the size of most of the suitcases that were lugged onto the plane. \n\nAs for the bag itself, I want to love it (love the look) but don’t.  It’s not very comfortable wearing with the straps on my back. I had to carry my laptop and some electronics and it just felt heavy.  There aren’t any load lifters, sternum strap or waist strap.   The shoulder straps also have reverse tightening. So instead of pulling down toward your back, you pull up and away from your body. \n\nMy laptop is too big to fit into the laptop space, so I just put it on top of my stuff in the bag for easy plane access and in case I had to take it out of the bag. \n\nI also feel like there’s lots of straps dangling everywhere. \n\nI’ll probably relegate it to car camping or lugging ski stuff.  Maybe I’ll sell it.",

Wanted the cavernous nature of a duffel but to be able to carry it like a backpack for a long walk from a train station, walk through air ports etc. We don’t plan on truly backpacking w them. Would’ve preferred two Smalls as we really don’t need that much room by volume but I’m pretty tall and when loaded with the same weight the S actually feels much heavier on my back as my lower back/waist aren’t supporting the weight at all. As far as being too big I’ve literally never had a problem carrying on a way too big duffle even on smaller aircraft. It always fits and as long as you just keep it moving no one is gonna stop you unless you just get unlucky with a gate agent who takes their job way too seriously.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1e3kgcf/tnf_base_camp_voyager_sling_review_almost_perfect/",
        "selftext": "I have been on sort of a sling voyage and have tried so many different slings and bought a few. Big to small and I think at one point I ordered all the TomToc slings. Eventually got to the point where I split time between a [Timbuk2 extra-small and small messenger bag](https://www.timbuk2.com/products/2023-classic-messenger-bag?variant=40578607415338), a [Patagonia Atom sling](https://www.patagonia.com/product/atom-sling-bag-8-liters/48262.html), a [Bellroy Venture 9L](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-sling) [Sling](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-sling), a [TomToc sling](https://www.amazon.com/tomtoc-Minimalist-Shoulder-Crossbody-Lightweight/dp/B08HSZ7HSF/) and probably a few others I’m forgetting.\n\nThe one sling I have used very consistently is a [Fjallraven High Coast Hip Pack](https://www.fjallraven.com/us/en-us/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/travel-bags/high-coast-hip-pack/) for my EDC. It’s perfect for a wallet, phone, sunglasses, keys, and headphones.\n\nWhat I have been looking for is a larger bag to carry my 11” iPad Pro, mirrorless camera and a few lenses, water bottle, bike lock, and other accessories for day trips and hikes. That’s where I would cycle through my various bags and find one that works. Each one had fatal flaws that if I was loaded out, I would just end up taking a backpack that was maybe half full. \n\n* The Timbuk2 XS was great but too tight, even fully extended (I am a taller, bigger dude). My wife eventually just stole that one but I would’ve been good with the XS if it had slightly longer straps. \n* The small messenger is just too big and flappy and I always had to strap down. I hated how insecure everything was in this one. \n* The Patagonia barely fits the iPad Pro but I really can’t take anything other than slim things with the Patagonia if I was taking that\n* The Bellroy was fine but still pretty tight with the iPad and it really didn’t work for things like hikes where I might want to clip something like sunscreen or a rain jacket to the outside\n* The TomToc was just stuck between my bigger slings and my Fjallraven so I would just never use it \n* I have a variety of other backpacks but I generally like having a sling for photography or biking\n\nI stumbled across The North Face Base Camp Voyager Sling and didn’t find a lot of reviews on it. So after about a month of using this thing, I will give you my impressions of the bag. \n\n[The bag as it sits, loaded up without being propped up](https://preview.redd.it/hrnzyb9dilcd1.jpg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48000f98c462b5a41abd3a1e8e6b5c49db3ee02)\n\n# Size\n\nThe first thing anyone should be aware of is the size of it definitely pushes the limit for what many would call a sling. As you can see in this comparison, while it’s not backpack-sized, it’s definitely bigger than some of the larger slings out there. \n\n[TNF Base Camp Voyager Sling, Patagonia Atom Sling, and the Bellroy Venture 9L](https://preview.redd.it/o97r0buhilcd1.jpg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daa2482d624e63254c86646fc1accc4d42c17f8e)\n\nThe size has advantages of course. A dedicated, fleece-lined tablet sleeve easily fits the 11” iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard. It also perfectly fits my 14” MacBook Pro. I can just chuck my Fjallraven in there, a jacket, waterbottle and camera and just go. \n\n[The 14 inch MBP fits in the back pocket like it was designed for it](https://preview.redd.it/udftdf0rilcd1.jpg?width=5000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e49bc1fb5a47eb61ff2fe7f8be59441b475afb7)\n\nWhen not fully loaded out, it will stay fairly thin. \n\n# How it wears\n\nI generally carry at least an iPad and water bottle and this thing feels great with pretty much any load i throw at it. The strap is long enough and it hits my shoulder just right. When I bring it to the front, everything is easily accessible. \n\n[No dedicated spot for a water bottle](https://preview.redd.it/f0j5yimxilcd1.jpg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74db6a4e5ef586e896016bdb92b0743cea80bc38)\n\nIt is not ambidextrous so you have to wear it on your right shoulder. Kind of a bummer but as a righty wearer, I feel like the ambidextrous bags always are at least a little bit less comfortable. \n\nIt does have a stabilizer strap but it is generally always tucked away. It’s nice to have it (and a dedicated spot to put it) but even on my bike, I generally don’t need it. \n\n# Functionality\n\nI really do like all the storage pockets on this. The front pocket is fleece lined but no interior pockets. It would be nice to have a key leash instead of inside the main compartment. \n\n[Front pocket](https://preview.redd.it/16ydr4e8jlcd1.jpg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=477fbd4252c56c3cca174a6e51f93688a2aa0243)\n\nInside the main compartment, there is a divider that is also a zippered pocket which is also fleece lined. There are also two pockets sewn into the divider as well as a zippered mesh compartment with a key leash. The divider only goes up about half way so you can pack this in pretty versatile ways. It isn’t designed for cameras but I don’t baby my mirrorless camera and it offers more protection than most of the other slings I’ve used. \n\n[The fleece lined divider zipper pocket with two open pockets on the side](https://preview.redd.it/abx1o3t5jlcd1.jpg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f384a525b78d13ea78ca49db09d4368d4e74007)\n\nThe main compartment can really swallow up anything. \n\nWhat’s missing? A dedicated pocket for a water bottle. Not a deal breaker and I do like that the water bottle sits upright on my back. \n\nThe back of the bag has the tablet/laptop sleeve. Also fleece lined. So much fleece. There is also a small pocket on the shoulder strap for a wallet, keys, headphones, etc…\n\n[Here is the 11\\\\\" iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard. Lots of room. ](https://preview.redd.it/u56415lcjlcd1.jpg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6b84b54f7b6cbce0a701e9915053f6d23dd4e3)\n\nI would’ve loved to have two sets of parallel lash points instead of one. It’s nice to be able to roll up a jacket or towel and throw it on the outside. \n\n# Other aesthetics\n\nI didn’t like any of the colors on The North Face site. I would normally just get black and black out the logos but they are gigantic. The other colors just didn’t do it, though the forest green was tempting. \n\nI found the asphalt color on Urban Outfitters and used a coupon to drop the price. The orange accents are okay for the trade off of having a blacked out logo. \n\nI also like that this sits upright when loaded up. I can just set it on a table or floor and it will just sit up. That’s nice and most of my other slings just kind of collapse. I think TNF did a good job here with the amount of rigidity. \n\nWhile the outside material seems very water resistant, the zippers are not coated. That's actually a positive for me because I find Aquaguard zippers to have a limited shelf life. I haven't tried this out in the PNW rain since we haven't had any since I've had it but I'm guess it will be okay. Personally, I wouldn't trust anything other than a rolltop or the Timbuk2 messenger for ability to deal with water.\n\n# Overall\n\nThis is really a nice bag for carrying everything I need for a day. The size is mostly a positive but if I were designing it just for me, I would make it an inch or so shorter on both ends. There are a few other minor issues that I would change but this has easily been the most versatile bag I've used for my specific needs. ",

Mainly why you choose it over any other backpack, roller for travel, ect. \n\nI’m a healthcare worker that flys once a week and I’m usually carrying a bunch of medical supplies and expensive medications. I see patients some times in rural areas. These are day trips on short flights. \n\nI’m thinking in my head of having a duffel as a carryon but I really dislike the backpack straps that I’ve seen on a lot of the modern duffels like the Patagonia Black Hole. I won’t be doing any long distant walks by any means with the bag at all. A robust kind of roller seems ok also but the wheels might get slightly beat up. \n\nThanks in advance. \n\n(Pictures: Wanded Carryall Duffel)",
