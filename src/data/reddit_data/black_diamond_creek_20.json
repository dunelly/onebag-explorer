I was in Portland in 2020 and scored a peak design bag for 150 so I always keep a eye out for premium bag deals.  Pre covid I saw more but not much since.

I am seeing them more often.  they can be a good spot for stock over runs on bags and other outdoor gear.  The stores usually have premium items that aren't available online. but like any clearance place if you see it and want it, probably should buy it and not expect it to be there later.  I usually go here first looking for stuff sacks, packing cubes, metal cups (including Yeti) and clothing.  The website is pretty solid and you can get free delivery to a store.  I like that because then I don't have to worry about package theft that way. I saw the yeti announcement for Mystery ranch, so I expect a lot of those bags to show up here over the coming months.",

            "body": "I‚Äôm going to be honest here - while I admire your ambition, my concern is that this product is just too specific and limited in its use and lifespan.  \n\nAs the parents of 3 who have grown up a bit now, we‚Äôve gone through a few different bags, but quickly realised that a simple, lightweight bag with a few easily accessible pockets that you can put anything in was the most practical.  We could then put in different pouches or containers depending on what we were doing, the age of the child, etc.  No need to carry dedicated storage for something we had no need for, or be unable to fit what we actually need into too small and restrictive pockets.\n\nFor example, how do you see the dedicated pocket for soiled items working?  Just shove them in there, so you have to clean and dry out the pocket every time you get home?  Or put things in a plastic bag first, in which case why do I need a waterproof, sealed pocket constantly taking up space and adding weight?\n\nOr the dedicated diaper storage.  How easily can I use that space for things other than what it was specifically designed for when my child no longer need diapers?  Same for the insulated storage, and the multiple separate parent pockets.  I can put 3 small things in one large pocket, but I can never put one large thing in 3 small pockets.  (But it would be good to see photos of the interior - I could be totally wrong and it really is far more key than the exterior.)\n\nCan I also ask what you intended use case is?  The features seem very focussed on airports and planes (laptop section, passport holder, luggage pass through, etc.), so it‚Äôs rather big and heavy for a day pack, but would struggle to hold enough clothes for baby and parent, so isn‚Äôt a dedicated travel backpack either.  (Edit: Looking at your specs and the photos, I don‚Äôt really get how it‚Äôs 30L capacity.  The external dimensions take up 28L, and I assume all the materials, zippers, etc. take up space.  How did you measure the capacity?)\n\nWithout meaning to be rude, to me this seems like a checklist of everything first time parents think they want beforehand, but as someone with experience, I could see myself very quickly being limited and frustrated by things that are tailored to a very short period of a child‚Äôs life, specific activities, and a specific way of doing things.  And this doesn‚Äôt look like a cheap bag I would be happy to grow out of after a couple of years.\n\n(And I have to agree with /u/agentoutlier - the leather just doesn‚Äôt do it for me, either aesthetically or practically.)\n\nI think what a good backpack for travel (and life) with children needs is flexibility - both in how individuals want to use it, and how it changes with the child.  This just seems too prescriptive to me.\n\nBut hopefully I‚Äôm very wrong, and it‚Äôs a great success.  Good luck!",

In addition to carrying your baby's belongings, we wanted to make it easy for parents to access their things as well - phone / wallet / passport / etc. Ultimately, whenever we've traveled (and seen other folks travel), it's always a hot mess. And our market research (surveys / interviews) indicate that most parents view that as being the most painful part of traveling -- *the journey*.\n\nYou make some good points about how the bag can grow with your children - there are some changes that we can make here so that the bag is more flexible (and not as prescriptive like you mentioned). \n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts! \n\nDaniel",

I LOVE that you plan to give your bag to your son some day - our bags collect our stories over time, and they'll create new memories with the next generation. Fun fact: the one backpack I bought for my dad was from DSPTCH. While he loved traveling with the bag, the one thing that bothered him was that it didn't have an external water bottle pocket (note: our bag absolutely needs to have that)! \n\nRe: the leather - that's good to know that you're concerned about how the bag will hold up in the washing machine. We're going to do a wash test this week, and will keep you posted! We did it with our last We think the leather will be fine if the machine's on gentle.\n\nRe: the spill proof pockets - is your concern here that the pocket will be less useful as children get older? I know you mentioned you'll follow up later, and so I'll patiently wait for some more info on this one haha :). \n\nThanks again for taking the time to write your thoughtful response, we're super grateful.",

It had a few key features:\n\n- Handle on top (easy to find and grab quickly or in the dark)\n- Long shoulder strap\n- Stood up on it's own\n- Spill resistant\n- One large main compartment for supplies and a blanket\n- One smaller pocket in the main compartment for snacks\n- Holders on each side, one for a water bottle, one for a baby bottle (or two bottles)\n- 3/4 zip that opened flat from the bag and had a fold out changing pad that could snap out if needed (I ended up using the pad all the time)\n- Neutral gray color (I'm a guy) with lighter inner green color to see items or spills\n- Minimal flat feet on each side of bottom to keep bag off ground like at movie theaters, street, etc.\n\nI'd personally rather have a regular backpack that doubled as a diaper bag simply by carrying a small changing pad, or a dedicated diaper bag that was light and without so many compartments and features. I never would have used most of the features you've added, like a passport pocket. \n\nAlso, it looks almost tactical, and that doesn't sell well with women, so you'd mostly be selling to men, who rarely shop for diaper bags on their own. The other post with the ruck bag is a good compromise (but the wife had to be sold on it), I'd add a diaper pad to that one and it does look like it can stand up straight.\n\nThe leather almost cheapens the look, since so many basic cheap bags online have added fake leather to them to try and looks \"premium\" when in reality a premium material choice from some of the bigger bag makers would be more optimal for withstanding use. \n\nPros:\n\n- Looks like a regular bag\n- Lots of compartments\n- Lots of opening options\n- Top compartment\n\nCons (for me):\n\n- Could just be a regular bag\n- No top handle\n- No diaper pad\n- Leather cheapens look\n- Weight\n- Hard to see in dim light (dark color and zips)\n- No shoulder strap option\n- Probably expensive for most people\n\nIt may sell well, even though it's very niche. I'd take everyone's feedback, look at other well made diaper bags, and maybe refine it slightly and I think you would have a good product. Half of the work would be marketing it to the right crowd IMO (I'm in marketing), so definitely make sure you get it on the right men's and women's blogs and reviews to get the most eyes on it.",

This past week was an exciting milestone for my wife and me - we got our third prototype in the mail, and we're so, so happy to see our vision come to life after working on this for over a year. While we're both hesitant to show a prototype to the public, we also really value the feedback - especially from this community, and so we're showing it here first!\n\n**Feedback Requested:** If you're a parent and have traveled with your little one(s) (ideally &lt; 2 years old), what features would you find most valuable? What features do you NOT find valuable? And if you love the backpack that you travel with right now with your family, we'd love to hear about it! \n\n**Background**\n\nWe‚Äôve always enjoyed traveling, so in our first year as parents, we took a two-week road trip and flew with our baby almost 10 times. We quickly realized that there had to be a better way to get to our destinations. We found ourselves helplessly digging through our baggage in dark flights or crammed cars, unable to quickly find anything we needed, and counting the minutes down to arrival. When we looked to the market for solutions, similar to our experiences with so many baby products, we were met with products that were either functionally inferior or aesthetically unacceptable (too mom-specific/feminine or childish). And so we set out to create the product that we would actually both want to buy (and carry) ourselves!\n\n**Features**\n\n* 3 Access Points into main compartment - front, side, top openings\n* Customizable Shelves to organize main compartment\n* Parent Pockets in lid, front and back to secure your essentials\n* Soiled Items Compartment at base - odor-resistant and waterproof\n* Diaper Essentials Compartment on left side for diapers, wipes, changing pad, cream\n* TSA-approved padded 15‚Äù laptop sleeve\n* Concealed back pocket for passports\n* Luggage handle pass-through\n* Spill-proof, insulated lunch bag\n* 2 External water bottle pockets\n* 2 Detachable stroller clips\n* Padded shoulder straps contour to mom or dad\n\n**Specifications**\n\n* Dimensions: 20.5‚Äù H x 12‚Äù W x 7‚Äù D\n* Capacity: 30¬†L\n* Weight: 3.0 lbs (empty), 3.5 lbs (with accessories)\n* Meets¬†international carry-on size¬†limits\n\n**Water-Resistant Sustainable Materials**\n\n* Exterior: 100% Recycled¬†polyester¬†with 100% vegetable-tanned leather panels at front and base\n* Interior: Recycled polyester printed lining\n\nThanks for tuning in, really appreciate it!\n\nDaniel",

            "body": "First of all, your bag looks pretty great, so good job on all the thought you've put into¬†it.\n\nI'll just throw in my two cents, which are basically along the lines of the other posters; for reference I mainly used an OG [North Face Recon](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/recon-backpack-nf0a3kv1) and a [Goruck GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1) as family bags and am now trying an [HMG Summit Pack](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/summit-pack).\n\nI think bag people essentially fall into two camps -- those who like built-in organization and those who don't, where the range is basically the style of [Tom Bihn Synapse](https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-25?_pos=6&amp;_sid=98880acaa&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=31746980184127) to [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), so it'll be hard to please everyone.  Modularity will ultimately cover everything, but it means you need to spend more to get all the modules.  So probably best to double-down on one of those segments.\n\nI think the ideal bag would have, in no particular order:\n\n* **Clamshell** \\-- ultimate access to everything, and the ability to tetris it all in.  Most of the time you lay the bag down on the straps, then zip open the flap (e.g. [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1)) but there are some bags (e.g. [Attitude Supply ATD1](https://atdsupply.com/products/atd1-backpack-black)) where you lay it on the front of the bag, then zip open the back panel.  The latter might be a little cleaner (since the part that touches you doesn't have to lay on the ground) and a little safer (the zippers are farther from wandering fingers), but *might* be less structurally sound (more weight on the zippers) and not as easy to get into (since the \"flap\" that opens is stiff).\n* **Quad-zip** \\-- when combined with a clamshell it gives you the side access that's all the rage, on any side, and still easy top-loading for quick-grabs.  Example: [5.11 Tactical Quad-Zip](https://www.511tactical.com/rapid-quad-zip-pack.html) or particularly the design of the \"wings\" on the [Peak Design Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).\n* **Security loops** \\-- to tuck the zipper under if you're worried about that sort of thing; particularly if quad-zip.  Example: [Topo Designs Travel Bag](https://topodesigns.com/products/convertible-travel-bag-laptop-backpack-30l) (which annoyingly doesn't have one on the smallest pocket) or attaching the zipper-pulls like [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).  Zipper pull locking might be a little more convenient, but easier to slash/cut.\n* **Internal attachment points** \\-- you could go with MOLLE/PALS webbing like [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), o-rings like [anything Tom Bihn](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/all-tom-bihn-stuff), or hook-and-loop (velcro) like [5.11 Tactical AMP line](https://www.511tactical.com/amp12.html?queryID=6c1b347c18500b85443d942e1e7b6abb&amp;objectID=214514&amp;indexName=magento2_productiondefault_products) or [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).  MOLLE-style webbing is more compatible with random accessories than o-rings and gives you more mounting options, but increases the complexity (gotta sew lots more stuff).  The good hook-and-loop stuff (not like typical cargo-pocket closure crap) seems like a neat idea, particularly when you can combine with something like [PD's FlexFold Dividers](https://www.peakdesign.com/search?q=flexfold&amp;type=product) which would require velcro on the front and back of the inside.\n* **Empty bucket** \\-- a bag's usable space should be pretty close to its external volume, and the more pockets and features you add will not only eat into that space (and add weight), but restrict your use cases (e.g. you can only fit a pen in a pen pocket).  Paired with 'internal access points' will let your users customize their experience.    Have some dirty stuff?  Get a rolltop dry sack (or a couple ziplocks) rather than a dedicated pocket you won't use most of the time (ditto for shoe pockets).  A converse example with too-much-but-well-thought-out organization would be the [Tom Bihn Synik](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/all-tom-bihn-stuff/products/synik-30?variant=31677201612863), or the really-cool-but-why-is-it-built-in tech pocket of the [Black Ember Shadow](https://blackember.com/products/shadow-22).  And as I've acknowledged this will be a contentious point.\n* **Quick-access pocket** \\-- an *external*, reasonably-secure (i.e. opens towards your back), volume-independent (i.e. doesn't eat into the space of another pocket, nor is it useless like the GR1 outer-slash pocket when your main pocket is full).  Example: [Topo Designs Global Briefcase](https://topodesigns.com/search?q=global+briefcase&amp;type=product) (more just an example of completely outside with it's own volume) or [Evergoods CPL24](https://evergoods.us/products/civic-panel-loader-24l-v2).  External water-bottle pockets on the other hand are overrated and stuff always falls out when you're bending over to pick up your kid/stuff they've dropped, and are unnecessary if you have easy side-access; if you do add them they should collapse out of the way.\n* **External atachment points** \\-- basically places to clip a water bottle, or strap your entire family's jackets when you leave on a chilly morning that immediately warms up.  Not compression straps (unless they're removable) because they just get in the way most of the time.  The loops on the [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?_pos=7&amp;_sid=9d4444ef4&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=29743829254188) look neat, but even just some plain daisy-chains you can loop some shock-cord or paracord through *when you want it* would be great.  External MOLLE is overrated because it's either too much when it's placed to be useful ([5.11 Tactical Rush](https://www.511tactical.com/rush-packs.html)) or just there for show ([GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), because anything you attach is balanced poorly or drags on the ground when you set your bag down).\n* **Integrated laptop sleeve** \\-- rather than a completely separate pocket (more zippers, more bag material, wasted space when you're not carrying a laptop) make easy top access *in the main compartment* to a thin internal, suspended sleeve.  The sleeve will be good for papers or other flat items, or a water bladder, without eating up any space (see \"empty bucket\").  Users that are really concerned about their laptop can get a soft/hard case, or offer a removable sleeve (using those internal attachment points) like the [Tom Bihn Laptop Cache](https://www.tombihn.com/products/cache?variant=6900434108479).  This will be another contentious point, but I've heard horror stories of the GR1's \"bombproof\" laptop pocket actually cracking screens when the bag is packed full so the pocket being separate doesn't really help.  Also most laptop pockets are designed for thin, Macbook-sized ultrabooks rather than Inspirons or chunky Lenovos (try fitting a T460 in a GR1...good luck).\n* **Removable hip-belt and sternum strap** \\-- for general carry around 20L you shouldn't need these for weight support, but they are useful for balance and to keep the bag from shifting around (e.g. if you have to run across the airport, or down a steep trail after your kids) so a simple removable webbing strap should be sufficient, and in a pinch will help support weight if you overpack or are carrying groceries/beer/bricks.  I leave two single-sided [Duraflex Slik Clips](https://milspecmonkey.com/store/hardware-diy/852-duraflex-slik-clip.html) on my GR1 and carry a webbing belt in the bottom of the bag if I need it.\n* **Lightweight** \\-- there are some really cool bags I've listed, but 3+ lbs *when empty* gets kind of old after a while.  This generally comes down to features (hence \"empty bucket\") and materials.  [X-Pac](https://www.carryology.com/liking/buyersguide/our-favorite-x-pac-backpacks-right-now/) and Dyneema Composite (DCHF) (like [HMG Daybreak](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/daybreak-ultralight-daypack)) are the cool new fabrics that can help, but also overkill padding or structure will weigh things down.\n* **Texture** \\-- there's just something about Topo Design's 1000D Cordura that feels so great.  Just sayin'.  Also interested to see the new 210D HT Cordura that's less abrasive (\"comfortable shirtless\") on the new [GoRuck Rucker 3.0](https://www.goruck.com/collections/rucksacks/products/rucker-3-0?variant=33023427444836).\n\nAnd obviously quality materials, good harness / padding, and all the other normal backpack stuff.  All of these things would be just as applicable to a diaper/parenting bag as any other use.",

            "body": "I‚Äôm going to be honest here - while I admire your ambition, my concern is that this product is just too specific and limited in its use and lifespan.  \n\nAs the parents of 3 who have grown up a bit now, we‚Äôve gone through a few different bags, but quickly realised that a simple, lightweight bag with a few easily accessible pockets that you can put anything in was the most practical.  We could then put in different pouches or containers depending on what we were doing, the age of the child, etc.  No need to carry dedicated storage for something we had no need for, or be unable to fit what we actually need into too small and restrictive pockets.\n\nFor example, how do you see the dedicated pocket for soiled items working?  Just shove them in there, so you have to clean and dry out the pocket every time you get home?  Or put things in a plastic bag first, in which case why do I need a waterproof, sealed pocket constantly taking up space and adding weight?\n\nOr the dedicated diaper storage.  How easily can I use that space for things other than what it was specifically designed for when my child no longer need diapers?  Same for the insulated storage, and the multiple separate parent pockets.  I can put 3 small things in one large pocket, but I can never put one large thing in 3 small pockets.  (But it would be good to see photos of the interior - I could be totally wrong and it really is far more key than the exterior.)\n\nCan I also ask what you intended use case is?  The features seem very focussed on airports and planes (laptop section, passport holder, luggage pass through, etc.), so it‚Äôs rather big and heavy for a day pack, but would struggle to hold enough clothes for baby and parent, so isn‚Äôt a dedicated travel backpack either.  (Edit: Looking at your specs and the photos, I don‚Äôt really get how it‚Äôs 30L capacity.  The external dimensions take up 28L, and I assume all the materials, zippers, etc. take up space.  How did you measure the capacity?)\n\nWithout meaning to be rude, to me this seems like a checklist of everything first time parents think they want beforehand, but as someone with experience, I could see myself very quickly being limited and frustrated by things that are tailored to a very short period of a child‚Äôs life, specific activities, and a specific way of doing things.  And this doesn‚Äôt look like a cheap bag I would be happy to grow out of after a couple of years.\n\n(And I have to agree with /u/agentoutlier - the leather just doesn‚Äôt do it for me, either aesthetically or practically.)\n\nI think what a good backpack for travel (and life) with children needs is flexibility - both in how individuals want to use it, and how it changes with the child.  This just seems too prescriptive to me.\n\nBut hopefully I‚Äôm very wrong, and it‚Äôs a great success.  Good luck!",

In addition to carrying your baby's belongings, we wanted to make it easy for parents to access their things as well - phone / wallet / passport / etc. Ultimately, whenever we've traveled (and seen other folks travel), it's always a hot mess. And our market research (surveys / interviews) indicate that most parents view that as being the most painful part of traveling -- *the journey*.\n\nYou make some good points about how the bag can grow with your children - there are some changes that we can make here so that the bag is more flexible (and not as prescriptive like you mentioned). \n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts! \n\nDaniel",

We're going to do a wash test this week, and will keep you posted!

            "body": "When mine was young, the best bag I had was from target. It had a few key features:\n\n- Handle on top (easy to find and grab quickly or in the dark)\n- Long shoulder strap\n- Stood up on it's own\n- Spill resistant\n- One large main compartment for supplies and a blanket\n- One smaller pocket in the main compartment for snacks\n- Holders on each side, one for a water bottle, one for a baby bottle (or two bottles)\n- 3/4 zip that opened flat from the bag and had a fold out changing pad that could snap out if needed (I ended up using the pad all the time)\n- Neutral gray color (I'm a guy) with lighter inner green color to see items or spills\n- Minimal flat feet on each side of bottom to keep bag off ground like at movie theaters, street, etc.\n\nI'd personally rather have a regular backpack that doubled as a diaper bag simply by carrying a small changing pad, or a dedicated diaper bag that was light and without so many compartments and features. I never would have used most of the features you've added, like a passport pocket. \n\nAlso, it looks almost tactical, and that doesn't sell well with women, so you'd mostly be selling to men, who rarely shop for diaper bags on their own. The other post with the ruck bag is a good compromise (but the wife had to be sold on it), I'd add a diaper pad to that one and it does look like it can stand up straight.\n\nThe leather almost cheapens the look, since so many basic cheap bags online have added fake leather to them to try and looks \"premium\" when in reality a premium material choice from some of the bigger bag makers would be more optimal for withstanding use. \n\nPros:\n\n- Looks like a regular bag\n- Lots of compartments\n- Lots of opening options\n- Top compartment\n\nCons (for me):\n\n- Could just be a regular bag\n- No top handle\n- No diaper pad\n- Leather cheapens look\n- Weight\n- Hard to see in dim light (dark color and zips)\n- No shoulder strap option\n- Probably expensive for most people\n\nIt may sell well, even though it's very niche. I'd take everyone's feedback, look at other well made diaper bags, and maybe refine it slightly and I think you would have a good product. Half of the work would be marketing it to the right crowd IMO (I'm in marketing), so definitely make sure you get it on the right men's and women's blogs and reviews to get the most eyes on it.",

This past week was an exciting milestone for my wife and me - we got our third prototype in the mail, and we're so, so happy to see our vision come to life after working on this for over a year. While we're both hesitant to show a prototype to the public, we also really value the feedback - especially from this community, and so we're showing it here first!\n\n**Feedback Requested:** If you're a parent and have traveled with your little one(s) (ideally &lt; 2 years old), what features would you find most valuable? What features do you NOT find valuable? And if you love the backpack that you travel with right now with your family, we'd love to hear about it! \n\n**Background**\n\nWe‚Äôve always enjoyed traveling, so in our first year as parents, we took a two-week road trip and flew with our baby almost 10 times. We quickly realized that there had to be a better way to get to our destinations. We found ourselves helplessly digging through our baggage in dark flights or crammed cars, unable to quickly find anything we needed, and counting the minutes down to arrival. When we looked to the market for solutions, similar to our experiences with so many baby products, we were met with products that were either functionally inferior or aesthetically unacceptable (too mom-specific/feminine or childish). And so we set out to create the product that we would actually both want to buy (and carry) ourselves!\n\n**Features**\n\n* 3 Access Points into main compartment - front, side, top openings\n* Customizable Shelves to organize main compartment\n* Parent Pockets in lid, front and back to secure your essentials\n* Soiled Items Compartment at base - odor-resistant and waterproof\n* Diaper Essentials Compartment on left side for diapers, wipes, changing pad, cream\n* TSA-approved padded 15‚Äù laptop sleeve\n* Concealed back pocket for passports\n* Luggage handle pass-through\n* Spill-proof, insulated lunch bag\n* 2 External water bottle pockets\n* 2 Detachable stroller clips\n* Padded shoulder straps contour to mom or dad\n\n**Specifications**\n\n* Dimensions: 20.5‚Äù H x 12‚Äù W x 7‚Äù D\n* Capacity: 30¬†L\n* Weight: 3.0 lbs (empty), 3.5 lbs (with accessories)\n* Meets¬†international carry-on size¬†limits\n\n**Water-Resistant Sustainable Materials**\n\n* Exterior: 100% Recycled¬†polyester¬†with 100% vegetable-tanned leather panels at front and base\n* Interior: Recycled polyester printed lining\n\nThanks for tuning in, really appreciate it!\n\nDaniel",

            "body": "First of all, your bag looks pretty great, so good job on all the thought you've put into¬†it.\n\nI'll just throw in my two cents, which are basically along the lines of the other posters; for reference I mainly used an OG [North Face Recon](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/recon-backpack-nf0a3kv1) and a [Goruck GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1) as family bags and am now trying an [HMG Summit Pack](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/summit-pack).\n\nI think bag people essentially fall into two camps -- those who like built-in organization and those who don't, where the range is basically the style of [Tom Bihn Synapse](https://www.tombihn.com/products/synapse-25?_pos=6&amp;_sid=98880acaa&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=31746980184127) to [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), so it'll be hard to please everyone.  Modularity will ultimately cover everything, but it means you need to spend more to get all the modules.  So probably best to double-down on one of those segments.\n\nI think the ideal bag would have, in no particular order:\n\n* **Clamshell** \\-- ultimate access to everything, and the ability to tetris it all in.  Most of the time you lay the bag down on the straps, then zip open the flap (e.g. [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1)) but there are some bags (e.g. [Attitude Supply ATD1](https://atdsupply.com/products/atd1-backpack-black)) where you lay it on the front of the bag, then zip open the back panel.  The latter might be a little cleaner (since the part that touches you doesn't have to lay on the ground) and a little safer (the zippers are farther from wandering fingers), but *might* be less structurally sound (more weight on the zippers) and not as easy to get into (since the \"flap\" that opens is stiff).\n* **Quad-zip** \\-- when combined with a clamshell it gives you the side access that's all the rage, on any side, and still easy top-loading for quick-grabs.  Example: [5.11 Tactical Quad-Zip](https://www.511tactical.com/rapid-quad-zip-pack.html) or particularly the design of the \"wings\" on the [Peak Design Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).\n* **Security loops** \\-- to tuck the zipper under if you're worried about that sort of thing; particularly if quad-zip.  Example: [Topo Designs Travel Bag](https://topodesigns.com/products/convertible-travel-bag-laptop-backpack-30l) (which annoyingly doesn't have one on the smallest pocket) or attaching the zipper-pulls like [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).  Zipper pull locking might be a little more convenient, but easier to slash/cut.\n* **Internal attachment points** \\-- you could go with MOLLE/PALS webbing like [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), o-rings like [anything Tom Bihn](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/all-tom-bihn-stuff), or hook-and-loop (velcro) like [5.11 Tactical AMP line](https://www.511tactical.com/amp12.html?queryID=6c1b347c18500b85443d942e1e7b6abb&amp;objectID=214514&amp;indexName=magento2_productiondefault_products) or [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).  MOLLE-style webbing is more compatible with random accessories than o-rings and gives you more mounting options, but increases the complexity (gotta sew lots more stuff).  The good hook-and-loop stuff (not like typical cargo-pocket closure crap) seems like a neat idea, particularly when you can combine with something like [PD's FlexFold Dividers](https://www.peakdesign.com/search?q=flexfold&amp;type=product) which would require velcro on the front and back of the inside.\n* **Empty bucket** \\-- a bag's usable space should be pretty close to its external volume, and the more pockets and features you add will not only eat into that space (and add weight), but restrict your use cases (e.g. you can only fit a pen in a pen pocket).  Paired with 'internal access points' will let your users customize their experience.    Have some dirty stuff?  Get a rolltop dry sack (or a couple ziplocks) rather than a dedicated pocket you won't use most of the time (ditto for shoe pockets).  A converse example with too-much-but-well-thought-out organization would be the [Tom Bihn Synik](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/all-tom-bihn-stuff/products/synik-30?variant=31677201612863), or the really-cool-but-why-is-it-built-in tech pocket of the [Black Ember Shadow](https://blackember.com/products/shadow-22).  And as I've acknowledged this will be a contentious point.\n* **Quick-access pocket** \\-- an *external*, reasonably-secure (i.e. opens towards your back), volume-independent (i.e. doesn't eat into the space of another pocket, nor is it useless like the GR1 outer-slash pocket when your main pocket is full).  Example: [Topo Designs Global Briefcase](https://topodesigns.com/search?q=global+briefcase&amp;type=product) (more just an example of completely outside with it's own volume) or [Evergoods CPL24](https://evergoods.us/products/civic-panel-loader-24l-v2).  External water-bottle pockets on the other hand are overrated and stuff always falls out when you're bending over to pick up your kid/stuff they've dropped, and are unnecessary if you have easy side-access; if you do add them they should collapse out of the way.\n* **External atachment points** \\-- basically places to clip a water bottle, or strap your entire family's jackets when you leave on a chilly morning that immediately warms up.  Not compression straps (unless they're removable) because they just get in the way most of the time.  The loops on the [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?_pos=7&amp;_sid=9d4444ef4&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=29743829254188) look neat, but even just some plain daisy-chains you can loop some shock-cord or paracord through *when you want it* would be great.  External MOLLE is overrated because it's either too much when it's placed to be useful ([5.11 Tactical Rush](https://www.511tactical.com/rush-packs.html)) or just there for show ([GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), because anything you attach is balanced poorly or drags on the ground when you set your bag down).\n* **Integrated laptop sleeve** \\-- rather than a completely separate pocket (more zippers, more bag material, wasted space when you're not carrying a laptop) make easy top access *in the main compartment* to a thin internal, suspended sleeve.  The sleeve will be good for papers or other flat items, or a water bladder, without eating up any space (see \"empty bucket\").  Users that are really concerned about their laptop can get a soft/hard case, or offer a removable sleeve (using those internal attachment points) like the [Tom Bihn Laptop Cache](https://www.tombihn.com/products/cache?variant=6900434108479).  This will be another contentious point, but I've heard horror stories of the GR1's \"bombproof\" laptop pocket actually cracking screens when the bag is packed full so the pocket being separate doesn't really help.  Also most laptop pockets are designed for thin, Macbook-sized ultrabooks rather than Inspirons or chunky Lenovos (try fitting a T460 in a GR1...good luck).\n* **Removable hip-belt and sternum strap** \\-- for general carry around 20L you shouldn't need these for weight support, but they are useful for balance and to keep the bag from shifting around (e.g. if you have to run across the airport, or down a steep trail after your kids) so a simple removable webbing strap should be sufficient, and in a pinch will help support weight if you overpack or are carrying groceries/beer/bricks.  I leave two single-sided [Duraflex Slik Clips](https://milspecmonkey.com/store/hardware-diy/852-duraflex-slik-clip.html) on my GR1 and carry a webbing belt in the bottom of the bag if I need it.\n* **Lightweight** \\-- there are some really cool bags I've listed, but 3+ lbs *when empty* gets kind of old after a while.  This generally comes down to features (hence \"empty bucket\") and materials.  [X-Pac](https://www.carryology.com/liking/buyersguide/our-favorite-x-pac-backpacks-right-now/) and Dyneema Composite (DCHF) (like [HMG Daybreak](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/daybreak-ultralight-daypack)) are the cool new fabrics that can help, but also overkill padding or structure will weigh things down.\n* **Texture** \\-- there's just something about Topo Design's 1000D Cordura that feels so great.  Just sayin'.  Also interested to see the new 210D HT Cordura that's less abrasive (\"comfortable shirtless\") on the new [GoRuck Rucker 3.0](https://www.goruck.com/collections/rucksacks/products/rucker-3-0?variant=33023427444836).\n\nAnd obviously quality materials, good harness / padding, and all the other normal backpack stuff.  All of these things would be just as applicable to a diaper/parenting bag as any other use.",

            "body": "I‚Äôm going to be honest here - while I admire your ambition, my concern is that this product is just too specific and limited in its use and lifespan.  \n\nAs the parents of 3 who have grown up a bit now, we‚Äôve gone through a few different bags, but quickly realised that a simple, lightweight bag with a few easily accessible pockets that you can put anything in was the most practical.  We could then put in different pouches or containers depending on what we were doing, the age of the child, etc.  No need to carry dedicated storage for something we had no need for, or be unable to fit what we actually need into too small and restrictive pockets.\n\nFor example, how do you see the dedicated pocket for soiled items working?  Just shove them in there, so you have to clean and dry out the pocket every time you get home?  Or put things in a plastic bag first, in which case why do I need a waterproof, sealed pocket constantly taking up space and adding weight?\n\nOr the dedicated diaper storage.  How easily can I use that space for things other than what it was specifically designed for when my child no longer need diapers?  Same for the insulated storage, and the multiple separate parent pockets.  I can put 3 small things in one large pocket, but I can never put one large thing in 3 small pockets.  (But it would be good to see photos of the interior - I could be totally wrong and it really is far more key than the exterior.)\n\nCan I also ask what you intended use case is?  The features seem very focussed on airports and planes (laptop section, passport holder, luggage pass through, etc.), so it‚Äôs rather big and heavy for a day pack, but would struggle to hold enough clothes for baby and parent, so isn‚Äôt a dedicated travel backpack either.  (Edit: Looking at your specs and the photos, I don‚Äôt really get how it‚Äôs 30L capacity.  The external dimensions take up 28L, and I assume all the materials, zippers, etc. take up space.  How did you measure the capacity?)\n\nWithout meaning to be rude, to me this seems like a checklist of everything first time parents think they want beforehand, but as someone with experience, I could see myself very quickly being limited and frustrated by things that are tailored to a very short period of a child‚Äôs life, specific activities, and a specific way of doing things.  And this doesn‚Äôt look like a cheap bag I would be happy to grow out of after a couple of years.\n\n(And I have to agree with /u/agentoutlier - the leather just doesn‚Äôt do it for me, either aesthetically or practically.)\n\nI think what a good backpack for travel (and life) with children needs is flexibility - both in how individuals want to use it, and how it changes with the child.  This just seems too prescriptive to me.\n\nBut hopefully I‚Äôm very wrong, and it‚Äôs a great success.  Good luck!",

In addition to carrying your baby's belongings, we wanted to make it easy for parents to access their things as well - phone / wallet / passport / etc. Ultimately, whenever we've traveled (and seen other folks travel), it's always a hot mess. And our market research (surveys / interviews) indicate that most parents view that as being the most painful part of traveling -- *the journey*.\n\nYou make some good points about how the bag can grow with your children - there are some changes that we can make here so that the bag is more flexible (and not as prescriptive like you mentioned). \n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts! \n\nDaniel",

We're going to do a wash test this week, and will keep you posted! We did it with our last We think the leather will be fine if the machine's on gentle.\n\nRe: the spill proof pockets - is your concern here that the pocket will be less useful as children get older?

            "body": "When mine was young, the best bag I had was from target. It had a few key features:\n\n- Handle on top (easy to find and grab quickly or in the dark)\n- Long shoulder strap\n- Stood up on it's own\n- Spill resistant\n- One large main compartment for supplies and a blanket\n- One smaller pocket in the main compartment for snacks\n- Holders on each side, one for a water bottle, one for a baby bottle (or two bottles)\n- 3/4 zip that opened flat from the bag and had a fold out changing pad that could snap out if needed (I ended up using the pad all the time)\n- Neutral gray color (I'm a guy) with lighter inner green color to see items or spills\n- Minimal flat feet on each side of bottom to keep bag off ground like at movie theaters, street, etc.\n\nI'd personally rather have a regular backpack that doubled as a diaper bag simply by carrying a small changing pad, or a dedicated diaper bag that was light and without so many compartments and features. I never would have used most of the features you've added, like a passport pocket. \n\nAlso, it looks almost tactical, and that doesn't sell well with women, so you'd mostly be selling to men, who rarely shop for diaper bags on their own. The other post with the ruck bag is a good compromise (but the wife had to be sold on it), I'd add a diaper pad to that one and it does look like it can stand up straight.\n\nThe leather almost cheapens the look, since so many basic cheap bags online have added fake leather to them to try and looks \"premium\" when in reality a premium material choice from some of the bigger bag makers would be more optimal for withstanding use. \n\nPros:\n\n- Looks like a regular bag\n- Lots of compartments\n- Lots of opening options\n- Top compartment\n\nCons (for me):\n\n- Could just be a regular bag\n- No top handle\n- No diaper pad\n- Leather cheapens look\n- Weight\n- Hard to see in dim light (dark color and zips)\n- No shoulder strap option\n- Probably expensive for most people\n\nIt may sell well, even though it's very niche. I'd take everyone's feedback, look at other well made diaper bags, and maybe refine it slightly and I think you would have a good product. Half of the work would be marketing it to the right crowd IMO (I'm in marketing), so definitely make sure you get it on the right men's and women's blogs and reviews to get the most eyes on it.",

This past week was an exciting milestone for my wife and me - we got our third prototype in the mail, and we're so, so happy to see our vision come to life after working on this for over a year. While we're both hesitant to show a prototype to the public, we also really value the feedback - especially from this community, and so we're showing it here first!\n\n**Feedback Requested:** If you're a parent and have traveled with your little one(s) (ideally &lt; 2 years old), what features would you find most valuable? What features do you NOT find valuable? And if you love the backpack that you travel with right now with your family, we'd love to hear about it! \n\n**Background**\n\nWe‚Äôve always enjoyed traveling, so in our first year as parents, we took a two-week road trip and flew with our baby almost 10 times. We quickly realized that there had to be a better way to get to our destinations. We found ourselves helplessly digging through our baggage in dark flights or crammed cars, unable to quickly find anything we needed, and counting the minutes down to arrival. When we looked to the market for solutions, similar to our experiences with so many baby products, we were met with products that were either functionally inferior or aesthetically unacceptable (too mom-specific/feminine or childish). And so we set out to create the product that we would actually both want to buy (and carry) ourselves!\n\n**Features**\n\n* 3 Access Points into main compartment - front, side, top openings\n* Customizable Shelves to organize main compartment\n* Parent Pockets in lid, front and back to secure your essentials\n* Soiled Items Compartment at base - odor-resistant and waterproof\n* Diaper Essentials Compartment on left side for diapers, wipes, changing pad, cream\n* TSA-approved padded 15‚Äù laptop sleeve\n* Concealed back pocket for passports\n* Luggage handle pass-through\n* Spill-proof, insulated lunch bag\n* 2 External water bottle pockets\n* 2 Detachable stroller clips\n* Padded shoulder straps contour to mom or dad\n\n**Specifications**\n\n* Dimensions: 20.5‚Äù H x 12‚Äù W x 7‚Äù D\n* Capacity: 30¬†L\n* Weight: 3.0 lbs (empty), 3.5 lbs (with accessories)\n* Meets¬†international carry-on size¬†limits\n\n**Water-Resistant Sustainable Materials**\n\n* Exterior: 100% Recycled¬†polyester¬†with 100% vegetable-tanned leather panels at front and base\n* Interior: Recycled polyester printed lining\n\nThanks for tuning in, really appreciate it!\n\nDaniel",

Modularity will ultimately cover everything, but it means you need to spend more to get all the modules.  So probably best to double-down on one of those segments.\n\nI think the ideal bag would have, in no particular order:\n\n* **Clamshell** \\-- ultimate access to everything, and the ability to tetris it all in.  Most of the time you lay the bag down on the straps, then zip open the flap (e.g. [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1)) but there are some bags (e.g. [Attitude Supply ATD1](https://atdsupply.com/products/atd1-backpack-black)) where you lay it on the front of the bag, then zip open the back panel.  The latter might be a little cleaner (since the part that touches you doesn't have to lay on the ground) and a little safer (the zippers are farther from wandering fingers), but *might* be less structurally sound (more weight on the zippers) and not as easy to get into (since the \"flap\" that opens is stiff).\n* **Quad-zip** \\-- when combined with a clamshell it gives you the side access that's all the rage, on any side, and still easy top-loading for quick-grabs.  Example: [5.11 Tactical Quad-Zip](https://www.511tactical.com/rapid-quad-zip-pack.html) or particularly the design of the \"wings\" on the [Peak Design Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).\n* **Security loops** \\-- to tuck the zipper under if you're worried about that sort of thing; particularly if quad-zip.  Example: [Topo Designs Travel Bag](https://topodesigns.com/products/convertible-travel-bag-laptop-backpack-30l) (which annoyingly doesn't have one on the smallest pocket) or attaching the zipper-pulls like [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).  Zipper pull locking might be a little more convenient, but easier to slash/cut.\n* **Internal attachment points** \\-- you could go with MOLLE/PALS webbing like [GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), o-rings like [anything Tom Bihn](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/all-tom-bihn-stuff), or hook-and-loop (velcro) like [5.11 Tactical AMP line](https://www.511tactical.com/amp12.html?queryID=6c1b347c18500b85443d942e1e7b6abb&amp;objectID=214514&amp;indexName=magento2_productiondefault_products) or [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?variant=29743829254188).  MOLLE-style webbing is more compatible with random accessories than o-rings and gives you more mounting options, but increases the complexity (gotta sew lots more stuff).  The good hook-and-loop stuff (not like typical cargo-pocket closure crap) seems like a neat idea, particularly when you can combine with something like [PD's FlexFold Dividers](https://www.peakdesign.com/search?q=flexfold&amp;type=product) which would require velcro on the front and back of the inside.\n* **Empty bucket** \\-- a bag's usable space should be pretty close to its external volume, and the more pockets and features you add will not only eat into that space (and add weight), but restrict your use cases (e.g. you can only fit a pen in a pen pocket).  Paired with 'internal access points' will let your users customize their experience.    Have some dirty stuff?  Get a rolltop dry sack (or a couple ziplocks) rather than a dedicated pocket you won't use most of the time (ditto for shoe pockets).  A converse example with too-much-but-well-thought-out organization would be the [Tom Bihn Synik](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/all-tom-bihn-stuff/products/synik-30?variant=31677201612863), or the really-cool-but-why-is-it-built-in tech pocket of the [Black Ember Shadow](https://blackember.com/products/shadow-22).  And as I've acknowledged this will be a contentious point.\n* **Quick-access pocket** \\-- an *external*, reasonably-secure (i.e. opens towards your back), volume-independent (i.e. doesn't eat into the space of another pocket, nor is it useless like the GR1 outer-slash pocket when your main pocket is full).  Example: [Topo Designs Global Briefcase](https://topodesigns.com/search?q=global+briefcase&amp;type=product) (more just an example of completely outside with it's own volume) or [Evergoods CPL24](https://evergoods.us/products/civic-panel-loader-24l-v2).  External water-bottle pockets on the other hand are overrated and stuff always falls out when you're bending over to pick up your kid/stuff they've dropped, and are unnecessary if you have easy side-access; if you do add them they should collapse out of the way.\n* **External atachment points** \\-- basically places to clip a water bottle, or strap your entire family's jackets when you leave on a chilly morning that immediately warms up.  Not compression straps (unless they're removable) because they just get in the way most of the time.  The loops on the [PD Everyday Zip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?_pos=7&amp;_sid=9d4444ef4&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=29743829254188) look neat, but even just some plain daisy-chains you can loop some shock-cord or paracord through *when you want it* would be great.  External MOLLE is overrated because it's either too much when it's placed to be useful ([5.11 Tactical Rush](https://www.511tactical.com/rush-packs.html)) or just there for show ([GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1), because anything you attach is balanced poorly or drags on the ground when you set your bag down).\n* **Integrated laptop sleeve** \\-- rather than a completely separate pocket (more zippers, more bag material, wasted space when you're not carrying a laptop) make easy top access *in the main compartment* to a thin internal, suspended sleeve.  The sleeve will be good for papers or other flat items, or a water bladder, without eating up any space (see \"empty bucket\").  Users that are really concerned about their laptop can get a soft/hard case, or offer a removable sleeve (using those internal attachment points) like the [Tom Bihn Laptop Cache](https://www.tombihn.com/products/cache?variant=6900434108479).  This will be another contentious point, but I've heard horror stories of the GR1's \"bombproof\" laptop pocket actually cracking screens when the bag is packed full so the pocket being separate doesn't really help.  Also most laptop pockets are designed for thin, Macbook-sized ultrabooks rather than Inspirons or chunky Lenovos (try fitting a T460 in a GR1...good luck).\n* **Removable hip-belt and sternum strap** \\-- for general carry around 20L you shouldn't need these for weight support, but they are useful for balance and to keep the bag from shifting around (e.g. if you have to run across the airport, or down a steep trail after your kids) so a simple removable webbing strap should be sufficient, and in a pinch will help support weight if you overpack or are carrying groceries/beer/bricks.  I leave two single-sided [Duraflex Slik Clips](https://milspecmonkey.com/store/hardware-diy/852-duraflex-slik-clip.html) on my GR1 and carry a webbing belt in the bottom of the bag if I need it.\n* **Lightweight** \\-- there are some really cool bags I've listed, but 3+ lbs *when empty* gets kind of old after a while.  This generally comes down to features (hence \"empty bucket\") and materials.  [X-Pac](https://www.carryology.com/liking/buyersguide/our-favorite-x-pac-backpacks-right-now/) and Dyneema Composite (DCHF) (like [HMG Daybreak](https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/products/daybreak-ultralight-daypack)) are the cool new fabrics that can help, but also overkill padding or structure will weigh things down.\n* **Texture** \\-- there's just something about Topo Design's 1000D Cordura that feels so great.  Just sayin'.  Also interested to see the new 210D HT Cordura that's less abrasive (\"comfortable shirtless\") on the new [GoRuck Rucker 3.0](https://www.goruck.com/collections/rucksacks/products/rucker-3-0?variant=33023427444836).\n\nAnd obviously quality materials, good harness / padding, and all the other normal backpack stuff.  All of these things would be just as applicable to a diaper/parenting bag as any other use.",

There was a group of four of us. We tent camped all summer. 14 weeks straight. Worked week days and hiked weekends, every chance we got. This beautiful girl happen to be in my group for the internship. We got to share that amazing experience that summer together. Including this hike.

I'm gonna say some things now that my post has gained traction.\n\nCops should be held to a higher standard than the public (not lower), they are given the privilege of carrying a lethal weapon in public and deciding who among us is arrested and charged with crimes.\n\nMission creep is real, officers should be trained to de-escalate situations and adhere to the hierarchy of force. That training then needs to be reinforced constantly and accountability forever looming over their heads.",
