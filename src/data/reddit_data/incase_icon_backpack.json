        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1dj8l8f/aer_city_pack_vs_alpaka_elements_pro_thoughts/",
        "selftext": "I doubt many people make a direct decision between these two bags, but they’re not so different.  Despite the difference in claimed volume (14L vs 26L), they’re very close in size and capacity.  Thought I’d put together a mini review and let you know my thoughts.  \n\nI started with the Alpaka and also ordered the Xpac version of the Elements Pro.  In my opinion, this bag looks better in Axoflux (their fabric option).  This bag definitely isn’t 26L, but I’d say it’s a good 20.  Despite not having a clamshell opening the “bucket” of storage is comparatively large and useful, especially if you use pouches or packing cubes.  This bag has an awesome silhouette and sits very close to the body, tapering from thin to thick as it goes down.  \n\nI ordered the Aer because I saw it was about the same dimensions, just a little thinner.  It actually looks larger and, in my opinion, less sleek than the Alpaka when viewed from the front.  It also looks larger on the back, even when both bags are empty.  Opposite of the Alpaka, it protrudes more at the top then tapers down to thinner at the bottom (kind of a weird look imo) unless fully packed out.  \n\n\nComfort: Aer wins.  The Alpaka straps are thin, but wide, resulting in a comfortable carry.  The Aer has narrower straps but better padding on both the straps and the back.  Like wearing a cloud, lol.  I hope it doesn’t break down too soon.  I will say both need to be cinched up pretty high to get good ergonomics or else they both make a pressure point/line at the bottom on your back.  Aer’s is less noticeable to me.\n\n\nLooks: in my opinion Alpaka wins here, but you decide.  It’s sleeker and looks more professional. \n\n\nFront half pocket:  Aer wins big time.  Not only is the Alpaka smaller, but it’s also thinner and is hard to access due to the flap.  Good for receipts or your phone, or Field Notes, but not good for quick access.  The Aer’s is comparatively quite roomy.\n\n\nFront admin panel:  For me, the Alpaka is better despite being smaller.  The Aer’s is much more roomy and goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you can put large stuff down there, compared to Alpaka’s which only goes down 2” or so past the zipper line.  If you don’t have much to carry though, this could be a benefit.  Also Aer has more slip pockets and two handy large ones near the bottom, but unfortunately it only has one large zippered pocket vs Alpaka’s three smaller ones.  Zip pockets are very desirable for me.  For example when accessing from an airplane seat where you have very little room, the way the zip pockets present themselves right at the top, on both sides, is very useful on the Alpaka.  Have to dig further down on the Aer and it’s one large pocket, so have to dig through the contents as well to find what you need.  \n\nAlso, the liner quality feels higher on the Alpaka.  Aer’s pockets are kind of loose and floppy and use elastic to cinch the tops, while the Alpaka material is thicker and the pockets are sewn tight to the panel with no elastic.  The material deforms to move out of the way, though.  I wish Aer would add a small zip pocket or two near the top of the outside panel of the admin panel, then it would be perfect imho.  The big/floppy slip pockets could be a benefit for larger items but I don’t carry much big stuff in the admin panel.  Alpaka also wastes space with their accessory ecosystem straps.  The compartment seems too small to use the accessories except for the keyring one.\n\n\nMain compartment:  if you have a jam packed front panel, it’s difficult to access the bottom of the main compartment of the Aer, especially with a laptop in preventing the back from deforming outwards.  The Alpaka’s admin panel doesn’t intrude into the bag volume very much much since it stops half way down.  Again the organization panels are tighter and higher quality on the Alpaka.  However I do really appreciate the two pockets in front on the Aer.  Wish Alpaka would add that.  I’d say the Alpaka offers more volume here by quite a bit, but I haven’t stuffed both full with clothing or something.  What really pushes me to the Aer is I can keep all my EDC toiletries in those two front slip pockets vs having to use a pouch with Alpaka, which I hate.  I carry mini/travel sizes of mouthwash, spray deodorant, and spray sunblock.  Could also use those pouches for granola bars.\n\n\nMisc: water bottle pocket on Aer holds a 24oz, Alpaka holds a 32oz.  I prefer the 32oz.  Aer has a side strap, very handy.  Aer’s sunglasses pouch is about 50% larger; a dividing flap in here would be nice to separate phone and glasses since it’s kind of too large for just your glasses.  Both bags stand on their own.  The zippers are larger on Aer, but this isn’t necessarily a benefit imo.  Both bags fail with the luggage pass through being sideways (hate this for airport use).\n\n\nOverall I’d say if you’re not a pouch guy and don’t plan to carry large items, get the Aer.  The Alpaka offers a cavernous main compartment that holds its shape well, but no organization in the ere besides the laptop and doc sleeve.  The Alpaka has a smaller admin panel, but the 3 zip pockets are great for me.  \n\n\nI think I’m keeping the Aer but the Alpaka is still at the ready.  I don’t want to use pouches which is pushing me to the Aer.  I would take the Alpaka out if I needed to carry lunch, a big jacket, etc.  both would work for that with no laptop, though.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

It actually looks larger and, in my opinion, less sleek than the Alpaka when viewed from the front.  It also looks larger on the back, even when both bags are empty.  Opposite of the Alpaka, it protrudes more at the top then tapers down to thinner at the bottom (kind of a weird look imo) unless fully packed out.  \n\n\nComfort: Aer wins.  The Alpaka straps are thin, but wide, resulting in a comfortable carry.  The Aer has narrower straps but better padding on both the straps and the back.  Like wearing a cloud, lol.  I hope it doesn’t break down too soon.  I will say both need to be cinched up pretty high to get good ergonomics or else they both make a pressure point/line at the bottom on your back.  Aer’s is less noticeable to me.\n\n\nLooks: in my opinion Alpaka wins here, but you decide.  It’s sleeker and looks more professional. \n\n\nFront half pocket:  Aer wins big time.  Not only is the Alpaka smaller, but it’s also thinner and is hard to access due to the flap.  Good for receipts or your phone, or Field Notes, but not good for quick access.  The Aer’s is comparatively quite roomy.\n\n\nFront admin panel:  For me, the Alpaka is better despite being smaller.  The Aer’s is much more roomy and goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you can put large stuff down there, compared to Alpaka’s which only goes down 2” or so past the zipper line.  If you don’t have much to carry though, this could be a benefit.  Also Aer has more slip pockets and two handy large ones near the bottom, but unfortunately it only has one large zippered pocket vs Alpaka’s three smaller ones.  Zip pockets are very desirable for me.  For example when accessing from an airplane seat where you have very little room, the way the zip pockets present themselves right at the top, on both sides, is very useful on the Alpaka.  Have to dig further down on the Aer and it’s one large pocket, so have to dig through the contents as well to find what you need.  \n\nAlso, the liner quality feels higher on the Alpaka.  Aer’s pockets are kind of loose and floppy and use elastic to cinch the tops, while the Alpaka material is thicker and the pockets are sewn tight to the panel with no elastic.  The material deforms to move out of the way, though.  I wish Aer would add a small zip pocket or two near the top of the outside panel of the admin panel, then it would be perfect imho.  The big/floppy slip pockets could be a benefit for larger items but I don’t carry much big stuff in the admin panel.  Alpaka also wastes space with their accessory ecosystem straps.  The compartment seems too small to use the accessories except for the keyring one.\n\n\nMain compartment:  if you have a jam packed front panel, it’s difficult to access the bottom of the main compartment of the Aer, especially with a laptop in preventing the back from deforming outwards.  The Alpaka’s admin panel doesn’t intrude into the bag volume very much much since it stops half way down.  Again the organization panels are tighter and higher quality on the Alpaka.  However I do really appreciate the two pockets in front on the Aer.  Wish Alpaka would add that.  I’d say the Alpaka offers more volume here by quite a bit, but I haven’t stuffed both full with clothing or something.  What really pushes me to the Aer is I can keep all my EDC toiletries in those two front slip pockets vs having to use a pouch with Alpaka, which I hate.  I carry mini/travel sizes of mouthwash, spray deodorant, and spray sunblock.  Could also use those pouches for granola bars.\n\n\nMisc: water bottle pocket on Aer holds a 24oz, Alpaka holds a 32oz.  I prefer the 32oz.  Aer has a side strap, very handy.  Aer’s sunglasses pouch is about 50% larger; a dividing flap in here would be nice to separate phone and glasses since it’s kind of too large for just your glasses.  Both bags stand on their own.  The zippers are larger on Aer, but this isn’t necessarily a benefit imo.  Both bags fail with the luggage pass through being sideways (hate this for airport use).\n\n\nOverall I’d say if you’re not a pouch guy and don’t plan to carry large items, get the Aer.  The Alpaka offers a cavernous main compartment that holds its shape well, but no organization in the ere besides the laptop and doc sleeve.  The Alpaka has a smaller admin panel, but the 3 zip pockets are great for me.  \n\n\nI think I’m keeping the Aer but the Alpaka is still at the ready.  I don’t want to use pouches which is pushing me to the Aer.  I would take the Alpaka out if I needed to carry lunch, a big jacket, etc.  both would work for that with no laptop, though.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

        "selftext": "I doubt many people make a direct decision between these two bags, but they’re not so different.  Despite the difference in claimed volume (14L vs 26L), they’re very close in size and capacity.  Thought I’d put together a mini review and let you know my thoughts.  \n\nI started with the Alpaka and also ordered the Xpac version of the Elements Pro.  In my opinion, this bag looks better in Axoflux (their fabric option).  This bag definitely isn’t 26L, but I’d say it’s a good 20.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1dj8l8f/aer_city_pack_vs_alpaka_elements_pro_thoughts/",
        "selftext": "I doubt many people make a direct decision between these two bags, but they’re not so different.  Despite the difference in claimed volume (14L vs 26L), they’re very close in size and capacity.  Thought I’d put together a mini review and let you know my thoughts.  \n\nI started with the Alpaka and also ordered the Xpac version of the Elements Pro.  In my opinion, this bag looks better in Axoflux (their fabric option).  This bag definitely isn’t 26L, but I’d say it’s a good 20.  Despite not having a clamshell opening the “bucket” of storage is comparatively large and useful, especially if you use pouches or packing cubes.  This bag has an awesome silhouette and sits very close to the body, tapering from thin to thick as it goes down.  \n\nI ordered the Aer because I saw it was about the same dimensions, just a little thinner.  It actually looks larger and, in my opinion, less sleek than the Alpaka when viewed from the front.  It also looks larger on the back, even when both bags are empty.  Opposite of the Alpaka, it protrudes more at the top then tapers down to thinner at the bottom (kind of a weird look imo) unless fully packed out.  \n\n\nComfort: Aer wins.  The Alpaka straps are thin, but wide, resulting in a comfortable carry.  The Aer has narrower straps but better padding on both the straps and the back.  Like wearing a cloud, lol.  I hope it doesn’t break down too soon.  I will say both need to be cinched up pretty high to get good ergonomics or else they both make a pressure point/line at the bottom on your back.  Aer’s is less noticeable to me.\n\n\nLooks: in my opinion Alpaka wins here, but you decide.  It’s sleeker and looks more professional. \n\n\nFront half pocket:  Aer wins big time.  Not only is the Alpaka smaller, but it’s also thinner and is hard to access due to the flap.  Good for receipts or your phone, or Field Notes, but not good for quick access.  The Aer’s is comparatively quite roomy.\n\n\nFront admin panel:  For me, the Alpaka is better despite being smaller.  The Aer’s is much more roomy and goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you can put large stuff down there, compared to Alpaka’s which only goes down 2” or so past the zipper line.  If you don’t have much to carry though, this could be a benefit.  Also Aer has more slip pockets and two handy large ones near the bottom, but unfortunately it only has one large zippered pocket vs Alpaka’s three smaller ones.  Zip pockets are very desirable for me.  For example when accessing from an airplane seat where you have very little room, the way the zip pockets present themselves right at the top, on both sides, is very useful on the Alpaka.  Have to dig further down on the Aer and it’s one large pocket, so have to dig through the contents as well to find what you need.  \n\nAlso, the liner quality feels higher on the Alpaka.  Aer’s pockets are kind of loose and floppy and use elastic to cinch the tops, while the Alpaka material is thicker and the pockets are sewn tight to the panel with no elastic.  The material deforms to move out of the way, though.  I wish Aer would add a small zip pocket or two near the top of the outside panel of the admin panel, then it would be perfect imho.  The big/floppy slip pockets could be a benefit for larger items but I don’t carry much big stuff in the admin panel.  Alpaka also wastes space with their accessory ecosystem straps.  The compartment seems too small to use the accessories except for the keyring one.\n\n\nMain compartment:  if you have a jam packed front panel, it’s difficult to access the bottom of the main compartment of the Aer, especially with a laptop in preventing the back from deforming outwards.  The Alpaka’s admin panel doesn’t intrude into the bag volume very much much since it stops half way down.  Again the organization panels are tighter and higher quality on the Alpaka.  However I do really appreciate the two pockets in front on the Aer.  Wish Alpaka would add that.  I’d say the Alpaka offers more volume here by quite a bit, but I haven’t stuffed both full with clothing or something.  What really pushes me to the Aer is I can keep all my EDC toiletries in those two front slip pockets vs having to use a pouch with Alpaka, which I hate.  I carry mini/travel sizes of mouthwash, spray deodorant, and spray sunblock.  Could also use those pouches for granola bars.\n\n\nMisc: water bottle pocket on Aer holds a 24oz, Alpaka holds a 32oz.  I prefer the 32oz.  Aer has a side strap, very handy.  Aer’s sunglasses pouch is about 50% larger; a dividing flap in here would be nice to separate phone and glasses since it’s kind of too large for just your glasses.  Both bags stand on their own.  The zippers are larger on Aer, but this isn’t necessarily a benefit imo.  Both bags fail with the luggage pass through being sideways (hate this for airport use).\n\n\nOverall I’d say if you’re not a pouch guy and don’t plan to carry large items, get the Aer.  The Alpaka offers a cavernous main compartment that holds its shape well, but no organization in the ere besides the laptop and doc sleeve.  The Alpaka has a smaller admin panel, but the 3 zip pockets are great for me.  \n\n\nI think I’m keeping the Aer but the Alpaka is still at the ready.  I don’t want to use pouches which is pushing me to the Aer.  I would take the Alpaka out if I needed to carry lunch, a big jacket, etc.  both would work for that with no laptop, though.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

A lot of people tend to recommend not going with duffels that have backpack straps because they tend to not offer the same comfort as a backpack that’s just meant to be a backpack, I wish I could try it out before I make a decision tho. I really like the look and aesthetic of Defy bags tho. I think one of their bags would fit perfectly into my collection.",

When I was buying it I had the slight misconception that two compartments may take up precious space out of the smaller 32L model. I think if I were to go back I probably would buy the double compartment just so I could have more organization, my synapse definitely spoiled me with having multiple pockets/sections lol. With that said I haven’t actually had any issue with the space on the single compartment and it has a nice simple and classy aesthetic to me. With the single compartment I can stack things flat and stack in a pattern that way I can utilize the most space I can, with the single compartment I would probably have to stand stuff sideways and upright, honestly it’s really up to what you prefer.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1gt3ydj/my_new_small_edc_backpack_incase_city_dot/",
        "selftext": "the backpack is designed to fit the old 13” MacBook, but surprisingly it just fits my 14” MBP in a very tight way. There is huge false bottom and thick padding on the upper part of the backpack( if you know any other backpack with this feature, plz let me know).\n\nI was originally looking into ALPAKA metro, AER Daypack and Osprey Arcane small day, but none of them have that simple horizontal quick pocket on the top front. I’m not a big fan of vertical zip front pocket or overly large front pocket. \n\nThe Dot is short in height, around 16”. I found it’s easy to reach the quick access pocket when the backpack is on chair or table.\n\nBuild quality is good for its price.\n\nThe volume on the e-commerce site says 13l, but the Japanese Incase site says it’s 11l. I can comfortably fit all my work stuff and 1-2 days clothing.\n\nIt is cheap, I got it like $40 on sale.\n\nOverall strong contender in the small EDC backpack category",

If it's a commuter pack, you will usually not have much in it besides gear and maybe a sweater or some groceries or some other light use case. Having the front panel fall open like a corpse everytime you open the main compartment is quite annoying.\n\nThe one thing I hate is the extra material at the top of the straps. I know it's because of the way Linus carries his backpack, lower down, but I like my bags as high up as possible. It seems like it would dig at the back of my neck and would be a bit uncomfortable for how I wear my bags. Still tempted to get it though, I've been looking for an EDC bag for a bit now and this seems to meet my requirements, at least on paper. Will wait for reviews.",

But until consumers stop buying bags which _don't_ spec the standard, market forces will prevail.\n\nIt's good to know about ASTM F2153-07, but I find thinking of \"bag class\", then use actual measurements and other research to be more predictive of bag performance.",

I do tend to overpack so I think I definitely could've gotten away with a bit less and not make the bag so tight. \n\nOverall, I found that the bag lacked structure on the back panel so I felt like it everything was pushing fairly hard into my ipad + kindle in the back laptop portion. If I had my 16\" backbook pro, i wouldve felt a little uncomfortable about the amount of pressure pushing into the laptop itself... \n\nOverall, i think it's a great back for a short weekend trip (Fri-Sun) type trip. I usually travel with a carry on + personal item so I bought this as a personal item to my luggage companion, but this spirit airline trip was a super budget trip going from JFK to Nashville for $100, no carry-on. \n\nAs you can see in the picture it fit fairly well under the seat -- a small part of the bag creeped over my toes but it wasnt uncomfortable. I didnt find it difficult to pull things in or out of the bag either. The zipper pulls you see on the top part of the bag is easy to access during the flight which i was able to pull out a snackbar during the flight. water bottle once out, was very difficult to put back because of how packed the bag was. \n\nOverall im fairly pleased with this bag. I bought it on ebay for $45 so can't really complain for that price either. Again -- as a solo, onebag for a trip, it was tight, but as a personal item along with a carry-on, i think its perfect. I also take more weekend trips to get out of NYC for quick friday morning - Sunday morning trips and i think its perfect for those little trips.",

The reason I ended up with a Tomtoc Switch case is that they randomly had one designed to accommodate the Hori Split Pad Pro. I didn't expect to find anything that would even fit that accessory, much less something designed around it, but Tomtoc came through! \n\nMy only complaint is that their straps can run a little short if you've got a bigger frame.
