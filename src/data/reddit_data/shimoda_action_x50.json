All the things with plenty of holders, a lightmeter and a filter setup fit comfortably inside the shimoda action v2 50l backpack that I have here and I use a large dslr core unit for it. The bagpack is very comfy and nicely padded. Extra point for the juicy yellow and the option to exchange core units to free/unfree extra space. The tripod is extra since I use a big and heavy one so I usually carry that on my shoulder for ergonimics. I like that the shimoda bagpack has the opening on the back so I don't have to lay it on the side that will be on my back later on. I find it quite good of a space for this big setup with multiple lenses. \nI also took the camera with me on a multi day hike in Finnish Lappland a few weeks ago and managed to fit it all inside the side pockets of a fjäll räven kajka 85L so it was very accessible the whole hike through. You can argue how smart it is to carry that much stuff extra on a week-long hike but I didn't mind. The chamonix camera came inside a padded bag and for the lenses I got a 19in padded square from the long weekend brand. Very good thingy since I fit two lenses inside there. Ofc I had to bring a darkbag and extra film but it was actually quite relaxing reloading in the mornings in the tent xD. I took a graflex back which fits 6 sheets of film but is only 1.5 regular filmholder thicknesses thick. I didn't double expose and I guess my copy is a good one since it didn't clog up or anything. Very happy with all of that. I had a lighter tripod head from benro than what I use usually, but took my induro at413 legs (a bit of luxury has to be) which turned out to be a very good idea since it was very windy.\nDoes anyone have a good solution for storage of exposed film sheets on a trip like this? It is not really a thing to take 15 holders just to take 30 exposures. Maybe I will post some images of my trip here in a few days.\n",

It might be worth the wait for a rf wide angle lens that has an f/4 aperture! And I’ve been loving landscape photography! I’m hoping to get into wildlife photography a lot more when we can travel again after the coronavirus is under control. This setup has been perfect so far!",
