The company had bid its newly developed Vulcan to fly that mission but the vehicle is not going to be ready on time. As a result, the Space Force agreed to allow ULA to launch USSF-51 on the company’s legacy vehicle the Atlas 5.\n\n&gt;In a statement May 19, ULA declined to provide specific reasons why Vulcan’s national security certification will be delayed and suggested that customer payloads are the issue. “Vulcan Centaur will be ready when our customers are ready for launch,” the company said.",

The slow pace, combined with rocket launch delays, means the company will probably have to seek an extension from the Federal Communications Commission, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters.\n\nThe agency, which has oversight of transmissions from space, expects the company to have half its planned constellation of 3,236 satellites operating by the end of July 2026. To meet that requirement, Amazon would have to at least quadruple the current rate of production, which has yet to consistently reach one satellite a day, two of the people said.\n\nIndustry analysts say getting an FCC extension should be straightforward, but some have begun to wonder whether that assumption will hold given that Elon Musk, who runs the rival Starlink service, is advising the White House on spending and personnel decisions.",
