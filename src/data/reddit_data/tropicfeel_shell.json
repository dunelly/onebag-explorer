            "body": "I love this bag! I preordered it last summer for my month long trip to Bali. I'll be real, once it came I was worried I wouldn't be able to fit everything. But I did! I got their packing cube that is really compact. I really love the pocket at the bottom that you can take out or not use. I brought two pairs of shoes and the pair I wasn't wearing I either had in that pocket or when I was barefoot (like getting onto the boat), I clipped the other shoe on the bag. The one thing I would change is the waterbottle holder to be a bit bigger.\n\nIt held up really well and still looks brand new. I stuffed that thing and nothing ever broke or frayed. I got it for $200 and the packing cube was an additional $25? I believe. Well worth it! It'll last me years.",

For their supposed \"retail\" price you could get an Attitude Supply ATD1 (well, when they release new batches), which is expandable in that same range except up to 55L.  \n\n\nIn general, anything that tries to do everything isn't very good at any of them. For EDC use, the access options on this are awful compared to something like a CPL24 or even a GR1 or a multitude of other options. At its supposed 40L capacity, there are simply better options. I guess if you own zero organizers and like the idea of a closet organizer in your pack instead of using packing cubes, starting from zero to this is probably good for travel.  \n\n\nIf you already have some packing cubes or pouches to put your clothes in, just about any panel loader will excel over this. Then again, I would never try to make my EDC bag also my 40L travel bag. Better to have dedicated packs for those roles.  \n\n\nThat said I've been collecting packs for quite some time and have several dozen, so maybe there's an appeal for somebody that needs literally a single bag and is willing to compromise on this stuff. Seen way too many definitely-not-cheap kickstarter bags that were very underwhelming in the end. I'll buy anything from Remote Equipment, Evergoods, and a few others off of kickstarter, because of a proven track record of delivering great stuff, but there are just soooo many Swiss Army Knife packs on kickstarter, I'm very leery.",

            "body": "I ordered and extensively tested the Tropicfeel Shelter. I ordered the Shelter, the Daypack, and the Toiletry Bag. To provide some context about myself: I'm a male, 165 cm tall, athletically built, with extensive experience as a backpacker (I've walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain multiple times and have taken backpacking trips around the world).\n\nHere's my concise feedback on these items:\n\n## Shelter\n\nPros:\n\n* The material and craftsmanship are of very high quality.\n* I like the concept and the ability to attach things to the backpack.\\*\n* The aesthetics are also top-notch (subjective).\n* The compact design of the backpack with minimal extra features like excessively long straps.\n* The weight considering its size.\n* The flexibility to expand the backpack from 30L to over 66L.\\*\n* The clamshell design, which makes it easy to access items like a notebook.\\*\\*\n\nNeutral:\n\n* It's a pity that the back panel with the notebook compartment isn't designed like the Shell. It's quite pragmatic and not well-padded.\\*\\*\n* When attaching the Daypack to the front, it's not securely fastened to the Shelter and tends to sag.\n* The back panel is quite rigid, and I can imagine it might cause discomfort and chafing over time.\n\nCons:\n\n* The biggest drawback and deal-breaker are the shoulder straps. I'm not sure if anyone tested them during development, but they are so thin that the backpack is almost unusable with any significant load. I tested the backpack with weights ranging from 7 to 17 kilograms, and it becomes painful to carry after a short period. Even the fabric on the shoulder straps is rough, making it uncomfortable to wear with a tank top in warm weather. Unfortunately, the expandable features are of no use if you can't carry the backpack.\\*\\*\n* The hip belt is equally under-padded and too small.\n* The front pocket, side pockets, and small pockets are almost unusable when the backpack is fully loaded. At most, you can fit a passport, but even a book is a tight fit. Consequently, you have only the main compartment to store items.\n* If you use the rolltop at the top, you can't use the upper side pockets because the rolltop straps overlap them. I don't understand why they weren't positioned higher.\n* When wearing the backpack on your back with the hip belt on, the bottom of the back panel keeps flexing and making a cracking noise. This part isn't robustly designed and adapts to movement, causing a constant cracking sound.\n* Lastly, the price. With a few attachments, the cost of the backpack exceeds €350.\n\nConclusion: A very high-quality backpack that unfortunately fails in its core features. What good is a backpack that I can neither load properly nor comfortably carry?\n\n## Daypack\n\nPros:\n\n* It looks really good.\n* Plenty of space inside.\n* Front straps for external attachment.\n\nNeutral:\n\n* The material seems quite high quality.\n* Rubber-like and strong odor inside (might dissipate over time).\n* Small pocket for a notebook, which can sometimes be too small.\n\nCons:\n\n* The craftsmanship on the shoulder straps is terrible. I had a sharp edge on both sides that caused severe itching.\n* It's nice that the shoulder straps use the same metal hooks as everywhere else. Also, the advertising shows a person at the beach in a tank top. But has anyone actually tried this? The hooks dig into the skin when wearing a tank top, making it impossible to carry.\n* The shoulder straps are too thick. It makes sense for someone as slender as the person in the advertisement, but as soon as you have a bit of chest muscle, it becomes uncomfortable.\n\nConclusion: Great idea, but like the Shelter, it falls short in terms of technical performance.\n\n## Toiletry Bag\n\nPros:\n\n* Organization of compartments.\n* Mirror.\n* The detachable pouch.\n* The option to hang the bag.\n* Compartment separation.\n\nNeutral:\n\n* I'm not sure if the bag would pass airport security as it's not entirely transparent.\n* It can be challenging to close the bag when it's full.\n\nCons:\n\n* The craftsmanship seems cheap and not justified by the price.\n* The price.\n* The mirror in the bag is absolutely sensitive. After removing the plastic I had already scratches on it. And after cleaning it with a soft towel (the same as I use for my glasses) I had unbelievable scratches on the surface. I never saw something more sensitive than this!\n\nConclusion: I kept the bag because I couldn't find another one on the market that suits my needs. However, I wouldn't pay the full price for it.\n\nOverall Conclusion: A great brand with excellent marketing and partially high-quality products. The presentation is also impressive. However, I seriously wonder if anyone has practically used or tested these products. Regarding the core product (the backpack), they are unfortunately entirely unusable.",

Safety in clamshell opening being where the shoulder straps are. I’m currently about to purchase this as it’s currently 30% off. £250 including accessories I think hits the mark. But if you don’t want the fancy accessories it’s £167 currently until Friday. Been doing a lot of research with this bag (as much as can be done being it’s just been released)\n\nThe extra clip on day bag as well seems useful if you want to travel “Priority on flights” you can use both bags for this.\n\nStandard tropic feel with the Kangaroo seems good.\n\nEarly Red Flags:\n\nWithout the early buyer scheme it’s a high price point at £239 but with the current offer (167) seems okay priced\n\nIt does look heavy however i think it weighs: 51oz / 1.45kg but I guess that’s what you get when you buy a bag that can hold up to 66L in full capacity mode.\n\n(See attached photo)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65qhb9vzodia1.jpeg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c254fd1ac8b9b1b5636a84d3458708ff92dedfe4\n\nOther than that I can’t see any other cons. Mostly pros. Depending on what you’re using for but I think this could easily last a months trip at a time.\n\nAlso another note I always like the built in raincovers but that maybe suggests it’s not as waterproof as someone might like… but the cocoon feature is neat allowing you to cover the whole bag to “check in” at a airport.\n\nI’m not sponsored in any way but this is my opinion on this bag. Here is the websites video if anyone else is too lazy to go find it 😂: [https://youtu.be/P-37rfr2Clo](https://youtu.be/P-37rfr2Clo)\n\nOther than that I don’t think this is a bad rucksack as I say it’s very good and covers a lot. I also think if you wanted to “risk” a Ryanair flight for example whose limits are 40hx25wx20d I think this bag could be squeezed down with the straps on the side maybe from say 50cm High to 45/46ish. And I don’t think Ryanair would question it but again I can’t be sure 🤷🏼‍♂️ I know I will be trying it.\n\nLastly another note release date is June 2023",

I am trying to see the technical part of this bag - so for this trip I wanted to be the most lightweight, because I have older and heavier gear.\n\nI carried 16 kg of equipment, sleeping mat and bag, tarp, some clothes, food and camera.\n\nI have used the kangaroo pocket for sleeping mat and tarp and it's quite elastic - like it's bouncing on the bottom of the bag. Sometimes I could feel it touching my body, but its just note, not a problem, Maybe there should be lighter items.\n\nClamshell opening - yes, there are two straps that needs to be undone before opening, but it's also not a problem for me, as I was opening it maybe three times a day. I had food in a dry bag accessible from top. So actually I like the system, you prepare at home, then you come to location, full open the bag and prepare camp. Then comfortably pack everything in the next morning, tighten the straps and go hiking.\n\nOne major problem that I have are the shoulder straps. First day we hiked for 12 km and the next day 16 km. I have bruised shoulder. I think that it could by my problem, because the first day I didn't use much of the lumbar support. When used correctly I was able to move the weight lower and the shoulder straps was not under so much pressure. On the second day, when I was putting the bag on, I felt the pain in shoulder, but after a few minutes I have forgotten about the pain. I will see next time. Final note about the shoulder - I used the PeakDesign capture on the left strap (the side with bruised shoulder) with Olympus M1 II, 12 - 40 PRO - so there was hanging nearly one kg - maybe this was the main problem.\n\nBelt strap. I didn't like the formed thermofoam, but after while I found it usable and I like it. Maybe it could be softer... I don't know, again, I will see next time.\n\nI wanted to bring up the things that I didn't like, but overall I like the build quality and as I said at the beginning, the technical part. I want to use it for hiking and for vacations abroad - using airplane or car and I am really looking forward to see it modularity.",

        "selftext": "I'm absolutely loving this Tropicfeel backpack and I packed it for a journey to Italy and especially Milan.\n\nThe backpack offers great versatility with a zipper that extends the bag, a pouch beneath to put shoes in and a net in front to put miscellaneous items in like a jacket. This means when I need to I can fit a LOT in this pack and when I arrive at my destination I just zip it down when unpacked to make it as a day pack.\n\nIn this setup I kept it simple. Putting my camera cube below (heaviest so most comfortable at the bottom) which includes a fullframe mirrorless camera, a 24-105 lens and a drone with extra batteries and remote. \n\nAbove that I've got my 2 Amazon basic packing cubes which contain 4 t-shirts, 2 shorts, underwear, socks and swimming pants. Enough to last me at least a week without washing. \n\nOn top of the cubes I've got my Tropicfeel Fidlock toiletry which can be hung outside of the bag whenever I need more space. But for now, to keep it as clean as possible, I've kept it inside. \n\nLast up, I always carry my microfiber towel and a drybag for my backpack in the laptop compartment. This will give quick access and isn't in the way when not necessary. I got my travel charger with 2 USB-C ports and 1 USB port in the netting together with 2 USB-C cables. On the top compartment I've got sunglasses and some cash. A powerbank sits in one of the two nets behind all the packing cubes, on the back of the backpack.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with this simple setup and I'm curious what you think of it as well! What else could I do to travel better/more efficient? Let me know!\n\nTLDR; my setup to travel to Milan and nearby with only one backpack",

I have this bag as well, but it has been relegated for more \"rugged\" activities as opposed to my go to travel bag now.  I'll use it for the beach, or if I'm doin a hiking trip, but some of the every day things I found to be cumbersome when I used it a couple times.  \n\n\ndislikes: \n\n\\- Too much \"open space\" for me.  I love what you did with the packing cubes, but I didn't like how there wasn't smaller pockets/compartments to put other things in there\n\n\\- the straps are surprisingly hard, I didn't get much comfort from them nor the top handle of the bag which is important as I'm always picking up/putting down.  wish it had some padding   \n\n\n\\-suitcase strap is so flimsy.  I know this is your one bag, but I brought a carry on with me knowing this would be the supplment bag, and trying to carry it on on the suitcase was a nightmare. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlikes: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-that shoe compartment is so nice.  I always feel like I need more shoes for different things \n\n\\- the accessories-  i didn't get the additonal accessories as i felt i was already $300+ in, but from what I see they work very well.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGlad to see someone has made great use of it!",

Although I don't need more organization as 4 mesh pockets are enough I'd love something like a separate compartment for your tech like the aer travel pack has.\n\nAnd yes the straps are kinda hard indeed, I was surprised as well. But the hold up well and to me they don't feel uncomfortable. Although I have bags that are definitely more comfortable.\n\nThe luggage strap is not meant for luggage funny enough. That explains why you think it's too loose. It's only meant for keeping the shoulder straps together which it does well.\n\nAnd yes I absolutely love that kangaroo pouch/shoe compartment. It's not in the way but very useful when you want too. Also the accesoires are indeed kinda nice!\n\nThanks for your write up :)",

            "body": "I ended up getting this bag a few years ago and used it for a few trips too. I've since stopped using the bag because I didn't really like the laptop holder - held in via velcro, and the camera cube. I had the cube filled with my camera gear but it wasn't a good choice for a hot LA day since the black leather(ette?) just absorbed all the heat. The external pockets were fine but didn't seem to have much room for storing things otherwise. I also tried their collapsible wardrobe thing, but in practice it is nowhere near as efficient as packing cubes which you're using. \n\nOne thing I still use though is the toiletry bag, which has been great, and I'll keep using it.\n\nLooks like you packed with efficient space, hope you enjoy the trip!",

Although I do like that it fits the bag perfectly. Yes the external pockets and especially the water bottle pocket really digs into the interior of the bag which is a shame. Also I sold the 12L packing cube and got the 10L from the Nest backpack because that fits a looot better under the spider net. \n\nThe wardrobe was indeed a bit of a gimmick. The idea is fun but it took a lot of space, didn't pack as efficient and was heavy as well. With packing cubes I'm able to pack at least 60% more if not twice as much for the same weight. So that was a no brainer for me.\n\nThe toiletry is indeed great! And thanks :)",
