            "body": "I suppose it's a rite of passage for every photographer to be upsold a bunch of Peak Design shite at some point. I spent ages on this subreddit and got very convincingly sold on some of the stuff. Overall, I find most of what I have is just about adequate. It's not brilliant, but it does its job so far.\n\n**My Kit**:\n\n- Canon EOS R6 MkI mirrorless camera body  \n- Canon EF-EOS R mount adapter  \n- Canon EF 24-105 mm F/4 L IS USM MkI lens  \n- Canon EF 50mm F/1.8 STM prime lens\n\n**My Peak Design gear**:\n\n- Peak Design Slide strap (in hindsight, probably should have bought a Slide Lite)  \n- Peak Design Everyday Sling 6l  \n- Peal Design Clutch hand strap  \n- Peak Design Capture Clip\n\n**Setup**\n\nI can carry my camera and lenses. It is a compact form factor. It is adequately cushioned and organised. It is reasonably comfortable to carry compared to my previous case for my old camera.\n\nI really like the Capture Clip mounted on the Sling so I can attach my camera to it when I have it down but not packed into the case, and I can hold it with adequate support with the Clutch strap. I've had some injuries to my fingers lately which makes it difficult to support the weight of the body and lens, so the Clutch really helps.\n\n**But**: the case is a very snug fit. I cannot fit anything more than my Kindle, the Slide strap, and the lens rear lens cap, body cap, and the caps for the adapter in a small pouch. The **bag was not designed for use with a lens and adapter combo**. The adapter adds a good 2 cm of length to the lens assembly, which makes the body of the camera stand up very close to the zip. I think the bag would only work if you have an RF lens.\n\nSecondly, the Sling **doesn't accommodate the large viewfinder of the camera well**. The viewfinder protrodes into the front of the bag and makes the fit even tighter, and makes it somewhat tight to zip up.I don't know if the tautness of the zip would affect the water resistance of the zip. Moreover, because of how tight the viewfinder is, it's impossible to use the zip pocket in the front of the sling for carrying batteires or memory cards.\n\nThe Cluth strap also doesn't play nice with the Capture Clip on the Sling. The Anchor frequently gets in the way of the release button, and it sometimes snags and releases the camera while trying to clip it on or unlook it.\n\nThe tablet pouch didn't work for me. I could fit my iPad M1 Pro 11, but I cannot then fit the camera with it, and I can either use the sling to carry my camera kit or use it as an everyday carrier for my iPad and some loose items. I can, at the very least, carry my Kindle. This'll do, I guess. But the Kindle makes the bag noticeably tighter.\n\nThe front pocket is almost entirely taken up by the Slide strap. There is some room for scraps of paper. But putting anything more in there makes the pocket bulge in an unseemly manner, and makes the main compartment even tighter.\n\nI also have not tested how water tight the zip is. I will likely carry an umbrella, improvise a rain fly from a different brand (unless Peak Design makes a rain fly compatible with the slings), or find some other way to just not get it wet. Also, in Black, dust and dirt become very prominent and it can be really irritating to wipe clean with a damp cloth. But I don't mind cosmetic signs of use too much.\n\n**A Few Customisations**\n\nI managed to attach it to the bottom strap of the Clutch leading up to the anchor using a silicone dog collar AirTag holder. It's not 100% secure as the quick release makes it very easy to remove.

            "body": "I suppose it's a rite of passage for every photographer to be upsold a bunch of Peak Design shite at some point. I spent ages on this subreddit and got very convincingly sold on some of the stuff. Overall, I find most of what I have is just about adequate. It's not brilliant, but it does its job so far.\n\n**My Kit**:\n\n- Canon EOS R6 MkI mirrorless camera body  \n- Canon EF-EOS R mount adapter  \n- Canon EF 24-105 mm F/4 L IS USM MkI lens  \n- Canon EF 50mm F/1.8 STM prime lens\n\n**My Peak Design gear**:\n\n- Peak Design Slide strap (in hindsight, probably should have bought a Slide Lite)  \n- Peak Design Everyday Sling 6l  \n- Peal Design Clutch hand strap  \n- Peak Design Capture Clip\n\n**Setup**\n\nI can carry my camera and lenses. It is a compact form factor. It is adequately cushioned and organised. It is reasonably comfortable to carry compared to my previous case for my old camera.\n\nI really like the Capture Clip mounted on the Sling so I can attach my camera to it when I have it down but not packed into the case, and I can hold it with adequate support with the Clutch strap. I've had some injuries to my fingers lately which makes it difficult to support the weight of the body and lens, so the Clutch really helps.\n\n**But**: the case is a very snug fit. I cannot fit anything more than my Kindle, the Slide strap, and the lens rear lens cap, body cap, and the caps for the adapter in a small pouch. The **bag was not designed for use with a lens and adapter combo**. The adapter adds a good 2 cm of length to the lens assembly, which makes the body of the camera stand up very close to the zip. I think the bag would only work if you have an RF lens.\n\nSecondly, the Sling **doesn't accommodate the large viewfinder of the camera well**. The viewfinder protrodes into the front of the bag and makes the fit even tighter, and makes it somewhat tight to zip up.I don't know if the tautness of the zip would affect the water resistance of the zip. Moreover, because of how tight the viewfinder is, it's impossible to use the zip pocket in the front of the sling for carrying batteires or memory cards.\n\nThe Cluth strap also doesn't play nice with the Capture Clip on the Sling. The Anchor frequently gets in the way of the release button, and it sometimes snags and releases the camera while trying to clip it on or unlook it.\n\nThe tablet pouch didn't work for me. I could fit my iPad M1 Pro 11, but I cannot then fit the camera with it, and I can either use the sling to carry my camera kit or use it as an everyday carrier for my iPad and some loose items. I can, at the very least, carry my Kindle. This'll do, I guess. But the Kindle makes the bag noticeably tighter.\n\nThe front pocket is almost entirely taken up by the Slide strap. There is some room for scraps of paper. But putting anything more in there makes the pocket bulge in an unseemly manner, and makes the main compartment even tighter.\n\nI also have not tested how water tight the zip is. I will likely carry an umbrella, improvise a rain fly from a different brand (unless Peak Design makes a rain fly compatible with the slings), or find some other way to just not get it wet. Also, in Black, dust and dirt become very prominent and it can be really irritating to wipe clean with a damp cloth. But I don't mind cosmetic signs of use too much.\n\n**A Few Customisations**\n\nI managed to attach it to the bottom strap of the Clutch leading up to the anchor using a silicone dog collar AirTag holder. It's not 100% secure as the quick release makes it very easy to remove. But the point of the AirTag is to deal more with the camera being misplaced than theft.\n\nI also wanted a way to carry a waterbottle with the Sling. Using carabiner clips made the bottle hit my elbow. So I used an elastic cinch strap with silicone anti-slip padding, along with a rubber-finish waterbottle from Mountain Warehouse, to secure a waterbottle on the Capture mount point on the other side from the camera. This works fine so far. I can feel the weight of a litre of water, and it does affect the balance of the sling and make it slightly less comfortable than when there was no water bottle.\n\n**Overall**\n\nModerately satisfied with it. There are some significant drawbacks, but it is nevertheless adequate for what I need. I can carry it out and about as I need to. But I don't think I can recommend this bag for anyone else using a Canon R5 or R6 where the viewfinder poses a problem with the zip.",

            "body": "I suppose it's a rite of passage for every photographer to be upsold a bunch of Peak Design shite at some point. I spent ages on this subreddit and got very convincingly sold on some of the stuff. Overall, I find most of what I have is just about adequate. It's not brilliant, but it does its job so far.\n\n**My Kit**:\n\n- Canon EOS R6 MkI mirrorless camera body  \n- Canon EF-EOS R mount adapter  \n- Canon EF 24-105 mm F/4 L IS USM MkI lens  \n- Canon EF 50mm F/1.8 STM prime lens\n\n**My Peak Design gear**:\n\n- Peak Design Slide strap (in hindsight, probably should have bought a Slide Lite)  \n- Peak Design Everyday Sling 6l  \n- Peal Design Clutch hand strap  \n- Peak Design Capture Clip\n\n**Setup**\n\nI can carry my camera and lenses. It is a compact form factor. It is adequately cushioned and organised. It is reasonably comfortable to carry compared to my previous case for my old camera.\n\nI really like the Capture Clip mounted on the Sling so I can attach my camera to it when I have it down but not packed into the case, and I can hold it with adequate support with the Clutch strap. I've had some injuries to my fingers lately which makes it difficult to support the weight of the body and lens, so the Clutch really helps.\n\n**But**: the case is a very snug fit. I cannot fit anything more than my Kindle, the Slide strap, and the lens rear lens cap, body cap, and the caps for the adapter in a small pouch. The **bag was not designed for use with a lens and adapter combo**. The adapter adds a good 2 cm of length to the lens assembly, which makes the body of the camera stand up very close to the zip. I think the bag would only work if you have an RF lens.\n\nSecondly, the Sling **doesn't accommodate the large viewfinder of the camera well**. The viewfinder protrodes into the front of the bag and makes the fit even tighter, and makes it somewhat tight to zip up.I don't know if the tautness of the zip would affect the water resistance of the zip. Moreover, because of how tight the viewfinder is, it's impossible to use the zip pocket in the front of the sling for carrying batteires or memory cards.\n\nThe Cluth strap also doesn't play nice with the Capture Clip on the Sling. The Anchor frequently gets in the way of the release button, and it sometimes snags and releases the camera while trying to clip it on or unlook it.\n\nThe tablet pouch didn't work for me. I could fit my iPad M1 Pro 11, but I cannot then fit the camera with it, and I can either use the sling to carry my camera kit or use it as an everyday carrier for my iPad and some loose items. I can, at the very least, carry my Kindle. This'll do, I guess. But the Kindle makes the bag noticeably tighter.\n\nThe front pocket is almost entirely taken up by the Slide strap. There is some room for scraps of paper. But putting anything more in there makes the pocket bulge in an unseemly manner, and makes the main compartment even tighter.\n\nI also have not tested how water tight the zip is. I will likely carry an umbrella, improvise a rain fly from a different brand (unless Peak Design makes a rain fly compatible with the slings), or find some other way to just not get it wet. Also, in Black, dust and dirt become very prominent and it can be really irritating to wipe clean with a damp cloth. But I don't mind cosmetic signs of use too much.\n\n**A Few Customisations**\n\nI managed to attach it to the bottom strap of the Clutch leading up to the anchor using a silicone dog collar AirTag holder. It's not 100% secure as the quick release makes it very easy to remove. But the point of the AirTag is to deal more with the camera being misplaced than theft.\n\nI also wanted a way to carry a waterbottle with the Sling. Using carabiner clips made the bottle hit my elbow. So I used an elastic cinch strap with silicone anti-slip padding, along with a rubber-finish waterbottle from Mountain Warehouse, to secure a waterbottle on the Capture mount point on the other side from the camera. This works fine so far. I can feel the weight of a litre of water, and it does affect the balance of the sling and make it slightly less comfortable than when there was no water bottle.\n\n**Overall**\n\nModerately satisfied with it. There are some significant drawbacks, but it is nevertheless adequate for what I need. I can carry it out and about as I need to. But I don't think I can recommend this bag for anyone else using a Canon R5 or R6 where the viewfinder poses a problem with the zip.",

If you’ve got a very compact camera or don’t mind squeezing stuff I’m sure it’s great but I opted for one of the older messengers because I usually have a body, a couple lenses, flash, and other stuff and I needed a more robust bag.

I can sense that the next lens I buy, I will need to change the setup. But that's a long way away just now because I just spent a huge amount on my camera kit. If I do buy a different camera bag, I'm cool with using this as an everyday sling for my iPad and other loose bits and bobs. Not ideal, as I spent a lot of money on it. \n\nI am actually also tempted by the Messenger rather than the 10L sling. Not sure how convenient it would be to travel with that and a big rucksack, espeically as carry-ons. But that's on my radar for the next time I need to buy a bag for camera gear specifically.",

            "body": "Hi\n\n\nSo I picked up my Sling bag a few years ago and instantly loved using it everyday. The only biggest downside I had that I just needed a teeny more space for smaller items. So recently I picked up the Field Pouch V2 thinking that I could somehow have it attached for extra space. Obviously there's limited loop points for it to attached properly but I think I've found a good work around using the existing pouch strap and one of the sling straps. First I use the puoch strap hook onto the pouch then through the excess strap pocket of the sling. Then using one of the two sling straps I threaded though it the belt loop of the pouch to back on top the loop of the sling. I hope these pictures makes that description make more sense 😅. Only down side is the strap getting in the way of the zippers but it's not a major issue.",

Great.\n\nBut which Packing Cubes should I get for my clothes - and how many?\n\nIt looks like the Packing Cubes divide this bag into thirds - whereas the 6 litre Everyday Sling divides it in half.\n\nAlso, how many layers of pouches can/should you add?\n\nThanks",

Better materials, bigger sturdier zipper ( a must) and still made of recycled material.  They are much easier to pack tight and compress and I don’t worry about breaking the zippers.   I liked the one I got so much I ended up getting 3 more within 2 months.  I also like white color which makes them easier to spot and harder to leave behind.  While the Patagonia ones have really sturdy material too, the zippers are a size too small and they don’t compress.  Good luck with your hunt.  That 45L bag was the biggest disappointment I’ve ever bought.  The size was either too big or too small it seemed.  You have me intrigued by the duffle, it looks really nice.",

I’m looking for something pretty snug (there’s not a ton of extra space around the tablet) but also can be thick enough to accommodate the Magic Keyboard. Any ideas?",

The Amazon listing has it at 7.7in x 10.4in (19.5cm x 26.5cm) and I'd say that's pretty close to what I have. An extra .5cm in both directions would've probably been perfect.\n\nThe size for the regular folio (without the Magic Keyboard hinge) is really good, so this will work for most of my uses. \n\nHere's some images of the fit and inside the sling: [https://imgur.com/a/peak-design-outdoor-7l-with-ipad-pro-11-uf6BWrM](https://imgur.com/a/peak-design-outdoor-7l-with-ipad-pro-11-uf6BWrM)\n\nHope this helps someone!",
