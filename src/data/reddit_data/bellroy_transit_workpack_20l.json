            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility.

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous.

One of the reviews highlighted the \"smaller-than-advertised\" sizing for the Pro 22L [here](https://youtu.be/1BRNjNCMij8?si=PNBb5nuFdBnWUjNF).\n\nAlso wanted to know how your v1 is holding up so far?

I bought this bag in a slightly different shade of blue a few years ago, and they made some improvements:  straps no longer loosen on their own due to thicker webbing material used, the back panel is more comfortable (thicker padding?)\n- The interior volume is spacious even with water bottle intruding part of the space.

            "body": "I got the previous edition of [Bellroy Transit Workpack](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-workpack-previous-edition) in Nightsky over 40% off original price during Black Friday. Some impressions:\n \nPros\n- Love that it fits my [Aer Slim pouch](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/88CQ3MRegz) within the admin shelf that’s part of the laptop compartment. It means I don’t have to open the rest of the bag most of the time. \n- I think this version is superior to second edition with two internal water bottle pockets (you don’t have to use them for water bottles) and the top sunglasses/quick-access pocket that aren’t present in V2\n- This is more of a V1.5. I bought this bag in a slightly different shade of blue a few years ago, and they made some improvements:  straps no longer loosen on their own due to thicker webbing material used, the back panel is more comfortable (thicker padding?)\n- The interior volume is spacious even with water bottle intruding part of the space. [Here’s a pack out done by the Mountainborn](https://youtu.be/zsJe8q3IP8U?t=1265&amp;si=6wD0sq5AqyBJ3SLD) for reference.  I only have [my Alpaka Meto Pouch V1 that houses my DJI Neo](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/kZqKhmcbVA) and my glasses case in it. \n- Love the use of metal and leather hardware\n- It stands on its own when the bottom is packed full. \n\nCons: \n- Don’t care for the shiny aquaguard zips. I wish they used the matte versions found on V2 and earlier versions of this edition instead. \n- The water bottle pockets fit my Yeti 18oz Rambler, but it won’t fit anything larger.",

        "selftext": "The Bellroy Transit Workpack comes across as an elegant and functional solution, specifically designed for urban commuters and those who need to carry a laptop and work essentials in style and safety. Here’s a detailed overview of its pros and cons:\n\nPros\n• Elegant and minimalist design: The Transit Workpack stands out with its clean lines and refined look, making it ideal for both the office and short trips. Its clamshell opening allows for easy access to the contents, simplifying daily organization.\n• High-quality materials: Made with recycled fabrics and leathers sourced from certified tanneries, the backpack offers a premium feel. Leather details, such as the zippers and finishes, contribute to creating a robust and durable product.\n• Excellent internal organization: Equipped with dedicated compartments—including a padded laptop sleeve for devices up to 16″, numerous pockets for accessories, and a specific section for documents or tech—the Transit Workpack lets you keep everything in order and within easy reach.\n• Versatility: Thanks to the luggage pass-through, it can be easily attached to a suitcase during travel. In addition, the quick-access pockets allow you to retrieve your smartphone, keys, or other small items without opening the main compartment.\n• Weather resistance: The materials used, combined with a water-repellent coating, provide effective protection against light rain and humidity, keeping your belongings safe.\n\nCons\n• Stiff padding and rigid shoulder straps: While the thick padding offers protection, it can feel overly stiff, making the backpack less comfortable during prolonged use. I have noted a “locking” sensation in the straps, especially when the load isn’t evenly distributed.\n• Limited capacity for longer trips: Although perfect for commuting and short journeys, the internal space might not suffice for those embarking on longer trips or needing to carry extra clothing.\n• High price: Like many Bellroy products, the Transit Workpack falls into a mid-to-high price range. For those on a tight budget, the investment might seem steep despite the quality and design offered.\n• Some pockets are not very spacious: For instance, the side pocket designed for a water bottle is quite narrow and may not comfortably accommodate larger bottles, forcing the user to store them in the main compartment.\n\nConclusion\nThe Bellroy Transit Workpack is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a backpack that combines refined aesthetics, high-quality materials, and superb internal organization—ideal for work and urban commuting. However, if you have heavier transport needs or prioritize optimal comfort during long journeys, you might want to carefully consider the rigid shoulder system and the elevated price. Ultimately, if your lifestyle calls for a sophisticated and functional accessory, this backpack could prove to be a valuable, long-lasting investment.\n\n",

Very nice backpack, comfortable to work as my work item, and it was really nice with quick access on one side for my passport and wallet. And it’s nice it can be order in EU which is not common here for backpack like aer or goruck. Happy travelling!",

I'm new around the block and could use some advice, my budget is under $200.\n\nI'm currently torn between two backpacks that cost exactly the same.  \nI'm a computer science college student living in a city with unpredictable weather—mostly sunny and humid, but with occasional heavy rain.  \n\nHere’s what I typically carry with me:\n\n- MacBook Pro M4 14\"\n- Wireless mouse  \n- Water bottle (25 oz or preferably 32 oz)  \n- Earbuds  \n- Phone and MacBook chargers  \n- Pencil case  \n- Two A4 notebooks  \n- A small book and a textbook  \n- Umbrella  \n- Toothbrush + toothpaste  \n- Sunscreen  \n- Small food storage container  \n- Portable utensils  \n- Glasses  \n- Sometimes a jacket  \n- Wallet  \n- Mini hand sanitizer  \n\nWhat I’m looking for in a backpack:\n\n- Portability  \n- Comfort  \n- Weather resistance  \n- Durability (fabric and zippers)  \n\nI currently use a Jansport (JS00TYP7) from 2016. It offers no protection for my laptop, and water gets in every time it rains. Even if it were brand new, it still wouldn’t meet my needs.\n\nI'm open to suggestions, but after watching tons of reviews, these two backpacks have stood out to me the most. For the air city pack 2, I'm not sure if it would fit all my stuff as it's 16L but has more pockets. \n\nThanks!\n\n",

Or did you mean to include the 3 liter front pocket?\n\n\nRegardless, I like the toilet paper standard as a lingua franca, although TP rolls vary a bit by country. Tennis balls would be better and ping pong balls (38mm) would approach the ASTM standard using 20mm balls. The larger the unit of measurement, the less that the small nooks and crannies can be included. You start to get into the efficiency of a particular proportion (like playing Tetris).\n\nIf you go by external measurements, the Dragonfly would fit into a 25 liter box and the Bellroy Transit would need a 36 liter box. That doesn't account for curves and taper. \n\nSeeing that you have them on hand it would be a great opportunity to check the accuracy of the published dimensions.",

It states 20 liters and I’d say it packs to about that maybe little less.  Organization layout didnt work for my needs and I wasn’t crazy about the straps and back panel.",

It is really functional, but has a bunch of padding and pockets that I don’t need, and they just make the bag bulkier/puffier/bigger than I need it to be, even when the pockets are empty.  \n\nSo was looking for something that basically just had the few pockets/padded sleeves I need, and nothing else.\n\nDid you find the Bellroy uncomfortable to wear because of the back panel and straps?",

It looked too tall and slim for my height (5’7”) and the handles were too low profile and hard to grab without brushing my hands against the bag.
