Not sure what year they were literally made in.  \n\nThe newer version isn't bad.  But it could've been better.  Imo.  Personally, I can't see myself getting it (as of now).  Below are some pros and cons.\n\n                                                                                                     \nPROS:\n\n--  Expandable side bottle holders\n\n--  Long horizontal pocket on the back of the backpack\n\n--  Long vertical side pocket for laptop. Cool design, keeps the laptops more secure and doesn't fall on other items in the main compartment.  (Pro is that people might not notice it or not think something valuable is in there.  Con is that it might be easier for other people to access)\n\n                                                                                                     \nCONS: \n\n--  Added that long horizontal line on the opening flap\n\n--  Reduced the length of the leather straps at the top where the long line is\n\n--  Removed the red and white striped interior\n\n--  Added another 2 long horizontal line next to the exterior lower pocket (towards the bottom of the backpack)\n\n--  New phrase/slogan. \"Put Yourself Out There\".  Boring, lame, and a bit annoying.  Something about the brand or backpack series would've been better\n\n--  Looks more like a basic backpack\n\n\nI think they strayed a bit too far from the original.  Overall, its not a bad backpack.  Better than some others that are of a similar price.\n\nLet me know what you think based on your experience",
