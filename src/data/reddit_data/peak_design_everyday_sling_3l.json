The only biggest downside I had that I just needed a teeny more space for smaller items. So recently I picked up the Field Pouch V2 thinking that I could somehow have it attached for extra space. Obviously there's limited loop points for it to attached properly but I think I've found a good work around using the existing pouch strap and one of the sling straps. First I use the puoch strap hook onto the pouch then through the excess strap pocket of the sling. Then using one of the two sling straps I threaded though it the belt loop of the pouch to back on top the loop of the sling. I hope these pictures makes that description make more sense ðŸ˜…. Only down side is the strap getting in the way of the zippers but it's not a major issue.",

Only 3.3cm length however I hear a lot of people recommending the 6L because the 3L is smaller than they think.\n\nAlso does anyone have any experience taking the 3L/6L on an airplane as a personal item? Will they be ok with it?\n\nThanks in advance ðŸ™‚",

I can actually answer this pretty well...\n\nit WILL fit, the 3L will fit an a7IV with the Sig 85 1.4 and no lens hood, or the a7IV with a 24-105 with no spare space. the blower will only fit if it's the mini version, I'd go with a secont battery over the charger. know that nothing elso will fit in the fromt pocket at the a7iv is quite fat due to the viewfinder...\n\nBUT: since it fits very, very snugly: lens pen no blower, as I said 2nd battery. but my overall recommendation is...\n\n\n...I'd straight up but the 6L. I recently purchased it myself because while I love the 3L, I really prefer carrying an extra lens or other things, my a7IV or a7RV fit in the 6L with: 40mm 2.5 attached, Sig 85 1.4 and 14mm GM \nand a kodak p210r\nand a spare battery\nand my ipad mini\nand a usb c cable\nand a snack bar\naaaand it's not that much bigger if you're not exactly a short person, as the 3L is shorter but still just as fat as the 6L\n\ntl;dr: go with the 6L, if you've had an a7c the 3L would be fine\n\nP.S. regarding the personal item: I don't know but it's smaller than a laptop bag so I'd assume yes :)",

I find that the larger sling just makes accessing things easier. The bags are just easier to work with when they aren't stuffed full. Since you are going on a trip you are going end up with extra things in that bag during your day excursions. The tablet slot on the 6L is the perfect spot for your passport and boarding passes while traveling. \n\nOn the other hand, constantly swinging the bag around and opening it to access the camera isn't great either, so perhaps grab a PD strap for your camera as well for when you reach your points of interest. The capture clips are great, but I think using them on the Slings is a bit funky. Actually, using them on the 3L is pretty much pointless because it blocks the zipper from fully opening. The 3L is great for things like concerts/events. \n\nI still like them both. The material is very water resistant. Even in moderate rain the interior space was dry. The interiors of both have held up very well. \n\nYou can definitely use the sling as a personal item on an airplane. What I have done is used a travel backpack as my carry-on and the sling as a personal. A not-fully-packed 45L Travel Bag fits under plane seats great. Also fits just fine in the overhead. I can fit the 5L Sling inside the 45L Travel Bag as well, not sure if it would work with the 6L though.",

The 6L is just a little taller and flatter on the bottom than the 5L, I've got both... I got the former largely for a change of color *and* for the external carry straps. I actually travel with 3 PD bags, my 45L as my carry on (overhead bin) with the 6L Sling inside it for daily use, and my 20L ED Backpack as my personal item.\n\n45L on my back, 20L on my front, I wouldn't recommend going far like that but for getting around an airport quickly without dragging a roller around (which some airlines like Delta will make you check just to speed up boarding) it works a treat.
