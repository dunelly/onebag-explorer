Maybe it will get softer with use. I'm a fan of waxed canvas. If I tap my fingernails on it, it makes a sound similar to cardboard, not exactly like it, just a bit of firmness. The goruck has a softer sound. It holds its shape more than other fabrics at this stage.",

I use the TD35 constantly with a CPL24 for 2-bag travel, with a backpack and duffel which both need to be below 7.5KG as is increasingly the requirement of most major international airlines. I usually hand carry the TD35 - it is a much better hand carry than the transit or anything I’ve ever used. I use the strap mainly when need stop restroom or free my hands at different places and don’t want to put the bag on the ground (which I generally don’t hesitate to do outside of a restroom).\n\nThe MW is not great as a side bag - won’t stay on the shoulder well and is less effective at hand carry -  but is superb as a one or 1.5 bag solution. The classic messenger strap is superb in this use case and is the best comfort you’re going to find without going to a backpack. You need to make the weight work and in this use case I’d also consider a 25 - 35L backpack strongly. The MW is also the best in rough / nasty environments - utterly bombproof and monsoon proof. The TD35 has never failed me in moderately bad conditions, but the MW has 2 layers of water protection and a tougher / easier to clean exterior fabric. \n\nWhat I do when flying with one bag (either the MW Transit or a backpack) is always have a packable duffel or backpack in my main bag , and if staff call me on weight I toss a few packing cubes into the packable bag to maximize my 15KG total allowance. Then after the weight, I toss the packable bag back into the main bag (preferably while staring the airline staff down). \n\nSummary of my use: \n\nSide-bag for clothes and non-tech gear during flight travel - TD35 all the way\n\n1-bag travel with a duffel - MW transit is the best I’ve found, also best if slugging around in SEA or Central America during rainy season.\n\nThese two duffels make all my other duffels mostly useless - as they cover most use cases.

My only complaint is that the strap on the TD35 can get uncomfortable with a heavy load. This can be replaced though and I’ll get around to that one day.\n\nGet both!

        "selftext": "Looks like EVERGOODS is having a sale on their civic Travel Bag.  Sent a email out with the following:\n\nIt took us a couple of years to custom-develop our Solution Dyed 840D ballistic nylon. Our goal was to coordinate the launch of all CIVIC bags in Solution Dyed textile concurrently with our mountain bags moving to Solution Dyed as well. How hard would that be? Well, harder than we thought. \n\nWe had our mill weave our mountain textile from a Solution Dyed polymer-level yarn. The fabric came out so soft we could not use it for the scheduled first production run of CTB35 we'd hoped to be Solution Dyed. We panicked knowing it might take another development effort to get the hand feel right for Solution Dyed 420D. But, we had a scheduled production run of CTB35 so we made a move to try and keep that production. \n\nAll zippers and trim items had been dyed to match the black solution dyed standard and were in the factory for usage so to avoid those going into the landfill we had our mill create 420D to that same color standard of solution black.\n\nThat 420D fabric was rushed to weaving and delivered to our factory. It came out beautifully BUT it also came out charcoal not black. So, we decided to not waste any more time or put anything into the landfill, so we made these gorgeous charcoal CTB35s.\n\nAnd as fate would have it, by the time we were ready to sell these 1st gen Charcoal CTB35s, our perfected 2nd gen fully solution-dyed black CTBs arrived.\n\nSo, to solve this tricky situation, we launched the 2nd gen solution-dyed version two weeks ago and figured we would come clean and sell this badass 1st gen Charcoal CTB at a special rate of $150 off. This helps you get an incredible EVERGOODS bag at an insane deal and helps us move our CIVIC line quicker to fully Solution Dyed.\n\nWin. Win.",

I also had a small duffle in the 30L range that had a similar shoulder carry method with ends that could fold down to make the bag smaller.  It was terrible.  I’m not particularly impressed with companies that are making duffles based off of soft sided toolbags or the old doctor’s bag with wide gatemouth opening.  35L is also going to be too small for my needs. \n\nI appreciate EG’s efforts to make a technical duffle but this doesn’t do it for me.",

            "body": "I’m intrigued by this bag, honestly. The look leaves a little bit to be desired, but the functionality is what’s piqued my interest. My use case would be car travel and business travel by air. For business travel, I have to take a pair or two of dress shoes that I’ve put a lot of time and energy into shining properly and I refuse to check those so I always end up traveling with backpack, duffel, and carry-on suitcase that I check. Clothes in the carry-on, shoes in the duffel, work tech in the backpack. \n\nI have the Peak Design travel duffel 35L, and hate it. The carry handles are horrendous; the magnets don’t work at all, either to snap the carry handles together or to snap the bag’s sides down as advertised; and the bag itself has no real structure and sags down in the middle at the bottom like every other trash duffel I’ve had. The exterior pockets are fine, but not revolutionary. The only thing it does well is look really good. \n\nI’m not as triggered to immediately buy the EG TD35 as I’ve been to buy their CPLs, CTB26, and CAPs, but I’m leaning towards giving it the ol’ college try. I think with packing cubes, it’ll load beautifully and do exactly what I need it to do, but do it better than any other duffel I’ve tried. \n\nI do wish they’d given us the option to either load a laptop or use that panel as a luggage pass-through. A simple extra panel of 840D fabric on that exterior side would’ve given us the choice.",
