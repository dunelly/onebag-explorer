The most used bag since I sold my CHZ22 was the CT15 in x-pac followed by my CPL24 Phoenix 1 and in cases of a short weekend trip the OD Green CTB20, the CHZ22 falls right at the point where I don’t need that extra girth of the CTB20 and CPL24. It is perfect for commute and also accommodates my camera when I need it (Sony ZV-E10 with a 50mm lens), I also found use for my CAP0.5 as case to store my DJI Mic 2 and its accessories.

Since I recently moved to using an iPad Mini A17 Pro over my iPad Pro 12.9 , I just have a laptop in the laptop sleeve in the bag and a iPad Mini just sits on top of the CAP2 Tech pouch.\n\nThe external water bottle pocket is also so convenient, since I had a very bad respiratory illness that lasted a bunch of weeks so now apart from wearing a mask everywhere, I carry hot water in a thermos for herbal tea and it fits my Yeti Rambler comfortably on both sides.\n\nIt’s a GOAT’d bag for me now and I won’t make the mistake of letting it out of my rotation.",

I sold them because of the size, except for the CTB26, which I let go due to comfort issues—the straps and fit weren’t ergonomic at all.\n\nI was gutted, as I thought the CPL was the most beautiful backpack ever made(at the time). Then came the CPL16—a dream come true for me! It fit my frame perfectly, and I even snagged the waxed tan version when it launched.\n\nFast forward to today: I received the CHZ22. I was sceptical at before ordering, as I’d always gravitated toward clamshell bags with laptop access and a boxier shape. But wow—this bag has completely won me over (at least in terms of looks). Packed or unpacked, worn or not, it’s just a stunning design.\n\nI’m officially CHZ gang! \n\nNow I’m waiting for more CHZ22 colours and preparing to go broke again. Thanks for reading the diary of a short man!",

I’m not so sure (see photos). \n\n- Side access is handy since I’m walking to school, but just for my sunnies, keys and AirPods which could be kept on my person I suppose. \n\n- Still digs in lower back for me. PLC20 has a curve at the base which mitigates the back dig (see photos). \n\n- The “boot” and the dump pocket of the PLC are going to be hard to let go of. \n\n- CPL is better at taking documents and student work home. \n\n- Forgot how much I enjoy external laptop access. \n\n- PLC will hold more.

Back dig might be the issue for me due to my height but I can confirm that when I wore it high and tight as intended, I didn’t feel it - which was an issue for me with the CPL24.

For context, I’m 5’1” with an athletic build and for as long as I can remember, every backpack I’ve ever tried just looked too big for my frame. That is, until I got the CHZ22. It’s not too tall and not too wide and still has potential to carry quite a lot. \n\nFor a while, I’ve wanted the CPL24 but couldn’t justify spending $280 for the v3 (I considered the v1 and v2 iterations, but didn’t want a backpack that was a dust and pet hair magnet and liked the new back panel). So, I got the CHZ22 because it was $80 cheaper and I didn’t mind a top-loading bag since that’s really all I’ve ever owned. \n\nI found a basically brand new CPL24 v3 for a very good price and I couldn’t say no. I just received it yesterday and I must say, I like it but I don’t *love* it. I told myself it could be a good travel backpack if I needed to bring more stuff than the CHZ could handle, but in all seriousness I always bring a carry-on anyway. \n\nI currently work from home, so it’s not like I need all of the space for the CPL24 and even the CHZ22 is at times a tad too big. \n\nThat said, I think I will be selling the CPL24 as I have realized the CHZ22 is everything I need and more.",

The Materials (you really want me to affirm this again?) are top notch, the slight curve in the back is a game changer, did a 12KM hike this past weekend and boy didn’t feel a thing, no back digging, straps are a breeze..such an underrated kit, fits my laptop perfectly and all my EDC.\n\nCons? Ya the zipper gives me a bit of anxiety and needs to held in a certain way when you zip it for it to not get caught up..the front panel “sinks” a bit when the inside pocket is loaded out and the mid section of the bag isn’t.\n\nApart from that all of it is quite a surprise if I must admit, makes me not miss my CTB20 (queue “Without you” by Chris Brown)..\n\nWill cover more in my review on my channel.\n\nThanks for reading !!\n\nKev - @OneTakeEDC",

I initially preferred the Aer ones but then after using all 3 (Aer, PD, Eagle Creek) for a few trips I started to really like the PD cube.\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t really explain why. Its not the lightest or smallest size wise. I think I just really appreciate the specific combination of material/feel, the “just enough” structure (something the Eagle Creek cubes don’t really have) and the fact that because it’s slightly bigger it can actually fit a ton of clothes and means on some occasions I only need one packing cube instead of 2 (edit: also the dual compartments).\n\nTLDR; I think it’s really hard to explain why the PD cube is so nice point by point but its specific combination of features work together really well and make it a pleasure to use.",

I'd like to get a newer model, but wasn't sure if it's essentially the same, other than the more mesh back panel, which would be a huge upgrade anyway as I sweat like crazy with 0 airflow of this older model. \n\nMuch love to EG and this community! \n\n",

From the first time I saw pictures of the CHZ, it was what drew my eye. It gives the bag such a distinct look, like some real thought and care went into it, almost like something an architect might design. It always makes me sad when I hear people with strong feelings against it. We're all entitled to our own opinions, but for me, it's beautiful. ",

I do however own the Evergoods CTB35 travel backpack, and the PLC20 backpack, and I adore both of them. I carry the PLC20 daily, and it is everything I want in a daily carry, and I could easily turn it into a 2-3 day trip bag. It's kind of a hybrid between the CHZ and CPL bags you're in between, in that it's a panel loader with no water bottle pockets like the CPL, but has an internal laptop sleeve like the CHZ, though they fixed the issue the CHZ suffers from with its own laptop sleeve. Both the CHZ and CPL now use the same balanced ballistic 840D nylon, which is durable and resists dirt, abrasion, hair, and pretty much everything. It's a sleeker version of the 1680d my PLC20 is made of. They also both have an amazing back panel if you run hot, and it's very comfortable. Frankly, GoRuck is too military for my tastes, so I'd heartily recommend the Evergoods. The CEO and lead designer are transplants from Patagonia and GoRuck, so they know what's up. Given that you'd want this to essentially be the everything bag, I'd recommend the CPL24, because it's the largest capacity, has a dedicated laptop compartment, and is better structured than the CHZ when not fully packed out. You can clip a water bottle to it if you really need it outside the bag, as there are loops along the sides. If I had to only have one bag, it would be that one, because it's both the perfect size and designed for everything you could throw at it.",

I avoided looking at it since I assumed it would be much smaller than I would need, but I think it could work. I tend to pack light and could probably make the CPL24 work for one bag travel, but that isn't something important to me as I'd have at least an additional carry-on anyway. I don't really need something quite that bulky, and I'm built like a bean pole so it would probably look pretty out-of-place.  \n\nThe only downside I see to the PLC20 is that it doesn't have a port for a water hose. A little time under the needle could probably fix that if I decided it was an absolute requirement.  \n\nHave you had any zipper issues with your PLC20? I've read that the CPL's often snag around the top corners, but the PLC looks rounded enough that it might avoid that issue entirely.",

How do the other fabrics compare for durability, flex, water (mud) repelling, and the ability to withstand punctures from sharp tree branches I'm likely to brush against?

It could do it (especially in an urban environment), but for back-country riding, no way (assuming other options). Whereas the pockets on the CHZ22 and the overall much sleeker/narrower profile is right at home on my back when on a bike.\n\nOn the other hand, if I ever needed to bring a laptop, I would leave the CHZ22 at home. Accessing even my standard size iPad Pro from the laptop sleeve when the CHZ22 is about two-thirds packed out is far from smooth (a lot of moving things around and removing certain other things in order to remove it AND re-insert - and i use pouches, like the CAP2). As a day bag, the CHZ22 is one of my all-time favorites; as a laptop-ready EDC or office bag, the CPL24 is almost impossible to beat.\n\nIn terms of durability, I haven’t put them through prickly real-world stress tests, but it seems incredibly robust - and Evergoods has a rep for standing by their products.\n\nThe GR1 is still probably closer to being that allrounder you’re looking for, even though personally, I prefer having the CPL24 for laptop and office carry, and the CHZ22 for EDC day carry and recreation, etc.\n\nEdit: clarity",
