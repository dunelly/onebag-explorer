I don't need a laptop because I don't work when I travel.\n\nThe packing list is designed for a warm climate, rather hot to tropical. accordingly, there is no warm clothing in the list.\n\nIf I would travel to colder regions, I wouldn't need so many shirts and could exchange them for hoodys or something similar.\n\nI don't wash my clothes on myself, so I have more clothes with me. If I did my own laundry, 5 changes of clothes would be enough. my plan is to have to go to the laundry after the seventh day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The packing list:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CLOTHES**\n\n* 6\\* tank tops\n* 2\\* T-shirts\n* 1\\* Merino Wool T-shirt\n* 1\\* long sleeve\n* 6\\* underwear\n* 3\\* socks\n* 1\\* swimming trunks\n* 2\\* light shorts\n* 1\\* rain poncho\n* 1\\* Buff\n* Flip Flops\n* packing cubes\n* laundry bag\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TOILETRY KIT**\n\n* Eagle creek toiletry kit Pack-It XS\n* Toothbrush\n* Toothpaste\n* Shampoo bar\n* Soap bar\n* Deo Cream\n* Nail clipper\n* Tweezers\n* Hair brush\n* Hair styling\n* Hair ties\n* 1\\* soap bar case\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TRAVEL PHARMACY**\n\n* 4\\* paracetamol\n* 4\\* travel sickness\n* 4\\* charcoal tablets\n* 2\\* electrolytes\n* 1\\* wound disinfection\n* 1\\* bandage\n* 3\\* plaster sheets to cut\n* 4\\* alcohol wipes\n* antimalarial drugs\n* Broad spectrum antibiotics\n* small scissors\n* 5\\* safety pins\n* 6\\* Q tips\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**MISCELLANEUS**\n\n* packable day pack 24L\n* 1\\* Fold-Back clip\n* 1\\* clothespins\n* 1\\* carabiner\n* Earplugs\n* 1\\* Padlock\n* 1\\* drybag\n* 5m Paracord\n* 1\\* pilow\n* 1\\* Sarong\n* 2\\* Ikea Pouches\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ELECTRONICS**\n\n* headlamp\n* Powebank 10.000 mAh\n* Socket adapter\n* 1\\* USB-C to USB-C cable\n* 1\\* USB-A to Micro USB Cable\n* bluetooth speaker\n* overear headphones\n* Beard clipper\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**not included in the pics are my wearing clothes and my sling**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy plan was to fill the SEG with packing cubes, I didn't want to stuff loose clothing into the segments because I think that's very confusing. with my technique I can take out the packing cubes and know what's inside of the cubes.\n\nI definitely have the feeling that the SEG28 has more capacity than the 28L mentioned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Main component:**\n\nSarong + flip flops\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**10L SEG:**\n\n3 packing cubes with clothes.\n\nreally no problem taking it in and out even when it's packed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**8L SEG:**\n\nPackingcube with underwear, black Ikea pouch, overear headphones with case, packable daypack, hair clipper\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6L SEG:**\n\nToiletry kit, travel pharmacy, rain poncho\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4L SEG:**\n\npillow\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't fill the laptop compartment and quick grab pocket.\n\nSo there is still a lot of room for more things.\n\nI could easily have gotten a pullover + towel in and other stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni love the secret compartment where you can stow your passport, that's really a great thing that other backpacks should have.\n\nthe compression straps do their job really well, they stick out a bit but do their job excellently.\n\nThe backpack gets its shape depending on how it is packed. if a SAG is packed bulkier then the backpack is bulkier at this section.\n\ndue to the arrangement of the quick grab pocket and the laptop compartment, the backpack protrudes slightly above the harness.\n\nThe bottle holder takes a 1L Nalgene bottle very well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, what do I not like so much or why will I not keep this backpack?\n\n\\- I had the constant feeling that the packed backpack was pulling me backwards (total nogo for me)\n\n\\- the shoulder straps are too wide for my narrow shoulders, i felt like the straps slip down all the time if i don't fasten the sternum strap.\n\n\\- i have the feeling that the backpack on the back is not so breathable and you'll sweat faster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbelieve me i really wanted to love it so badly (maybe i was too hyped), i love the style a lot, optically really excellent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I also prefer the conventional packing system = big bucket\n\nso for me it'll be the Patagonia Black Hole Mini MLC 30! I will do a MLC post soon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncheers :)",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

Does it feel heavy on your shoulders? \n* Would you see yourself carrying this entire loadout for extended _(&gt;1 hour)_ periods of time, uninterrupted?\n* Ultimately, do you think you'll travel/keep travelling with this bag?\n* Why not handwash?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've only tested the backpack in-stores _(with sandbags to test weight and capacity)_ and my own feedback echoes yours - \n\n* Didn't feel breathable due to the back panel material\n* The center of gravity was too far in the back and kinda pulling me backwards\n* Overall comfort was not _terrible_ but it didn't feel like a a solid bag for extended carry\n* While on paper I thought it'd be great, I actually found the integrated compartmentalization underwhelming - it is shared volume so depending on your packing cubes/pouches it can dig into the other compartments - but on the upside, with _proper_ pouches/cubes, it could be solid. But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The harness system was improved compared with the previous iteration.\nAll the materials feel really good and sturdy.\n\n\nThe Matador bag has obviously less structure but it is very lightweight. But that does not stop it from actually being super comfortable despite a minimal structure. The shoulder straps are actually quite good and the bag fits well snug against my back (I’m 185cm tall, 82kg).\nAlso, the materials feel good, much better than expected.\n\nAfter a weekend of packing and unpacking and trying both, I kept the Matador. The WANDRD despite a very good back support it felt like was pulling a bit backward and away from my shoulders. Also felt too boxy and wide on my back. As a super happy owner of a 21L PRVKE, I just had the feeling that all looked stretched a stretched version in the big brother.\nAlso, when packing clamshell, the bottom kept folding and losing shape, making it weird to pack. There is a similar issue on the Heimplanet Transite. It is a nitpick, of course.\nI was also able to pack more things on the Matador and I can only see how super useful the big bucket will be for my extra shoes and laundry during a trip.\nEven not having a water bottle side pocket, I could easily fit a Nalgene 1L plus a dopp kit in the 4L top segment, so it did not bother that much after all.\n\nI must say I am not a photographer and I do not carry camera gear. But I bring a 13” MacBook Pro and an iPad Pro 11”. The iPad also fits in the segments, which makes it even nicer if using the bag as a duffel on a car trip as it will not have any weight on top of it.\n\nFeel free to ask more stuff. There is not so much info on these bags yet, and not so much help on the WANDRD side for the non-photographers, so I thought it would\nbe good to make it available here.\n\n\nAdded some photos with back and side view from both bags and also that bulge on the bottom while packing. \n\nMatador:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/1OGpJSs\n\nWandrd:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/F1iJ3j6\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/yxC7SGz",

If you like VA, go for it.\n\nLong story:\n\nI have tried:\n\n\\- 2x 24\" monitor 1080p : too blurry, too small\n\n\\- 34 inch UW (from Samung 1440p): also, not enough PPI\n\n\\- LG Ultrafine 24inch 4k and 27 inches 5k: both are the best monitors I have tried so far. The image is just awesome and the design, while having big bezels, works great and is very sturdy. But I still wanted bigger. (Also, the webcam does not work properly with my MacBook version).\n\nI had first a Dell U3219Q, which was on the overall package better than my current monitor since it had usb-c, a smaller footprint deep wise and more accurate colors. curved. It does not seem so important, but it helps a lot. Everything seems more readable in every corner of the monitor, as it is more equally distant. Also, my wife uses it a lot and for her, the 32\" monitor is already massive, so it helped her also when she needs it. You need to take into consideration that the viewing angles are not good. For me, it does not matter because I am always sitting right in front of it, in the middle. The second is that you have fewer ports, but I was using the dock anyway for ethernet and other accessories. Ah! And a monitor arm is necessary with this one, as it has not so ergonomic options as the Ultrasharp monitors.\n\nSo, just ended with two hypothesis:\n\n38 inch UW : did not try as the PPI would be similar to the 34\" UW I tried before\n\n32 inch 4k: So far, the best option that worked for me.\n\nI had first a Dell U3219Q, which was on the overall package better than my current monitor since it had usb-c, a smaller footprint deep wise and more accurate colors.  Now what made change was this to be curved. It does not seem so important, but it helps a lot. Everything seems more readable in every corner of the monitor, as it is more equally distant.

The second is that you have fewer ports, but I was using the dock anyway for ethernet and other accessories. Ah! And a monitor arm is necessary with this one, as it has not so ergonomic options as the Ultrahsharp monitors.\nOther than that it great! Blacks are deep, text is crisp. All good stuff  (:\n\nI was eyeing the new 40\" 5k2, but I am afraid that this desk is not deep enough for it, so I will put that thought to the side (plus not having that amount of money to spend on a monitor)\n\nI hope it helped!",

But I just used it for a weekend getaway and absolutely loved it. /u/williamMurderface comment is something I see said a lot about it. And they're right, it's not a stiff or self standing bag if it's not packed out. That said, it wasn't floppy for me in use, and that's all subjective and based on your individual tolerance. I've had my eye on the Seg42 for a WHILE and planned on grabbing one, so was excited to see this version. I think a lot of really experienced Onebaggers will like this size, as they travel super minimal. \n\nAlong the line of the floppy feedback, I do think it might be able to benefit from a plastic insert, kind of like Aer packs. I don't however think it's necessary or a deal breaker.\n\nBut generally speaking, as someone that uses packing cubes and loves organization, I found this to be fantastic and one of the only true innovations in the bag space the last year or two (I don't dig the modular trend that happened; cool from an engineer and design perspective, not practical for me personally).",

Nice if they are used externally, even if ugly in the end. But there are a lack of lightweight options for internal MOLLE usage. \n\nMy gripe with bag in bag approach, especially especially smaller pouches, is that if it’s not packed full, pouches tend to eventually bunch towards the bottom of the biggest compartment. Sure, one way is to tighten up compression straps if the bag has some, but that in turn would impede quick access to pouches.",

Wanted to give it a try based on the previous mystery box result threads and I've been checking out matador's products (particularly bags).\n\n* $54.99 - [On-Grid™ Packable Duffle](https://matadorup.com/collections/packable-backpacks/products/on-grid-packable-duffle) \\- Was eyeing this vs the freefly duffle already, seems like a good, lightweight gym bag / weekend trip bag.\n* $29.99 - [FlatPak™ Zipper Toiletry Case](https://matadorup.com/products/flatpak-zipper-toiletry-case) \\- A bit on the larger side but seems pretty nice and lightweight. Will try using this instead of my normal dopp kit bag on my next trip.\n* $13.99 - [FlatPak™ Toiletry Bottles](https://matadorup.com/products/flatpak-toiletry-bottle) (pack of 1) - I use the small/med gotoob bottles so this'll be interesting to try out as it's slimmer and maybe packs better. Doesn't have a valve like the gotoob ones, so just slightly concerned whether the contents can spill out.\n* $39.99 - [Packable Beach Towel](https://matadorup.com/products/packable-beach-towel) (Tie Dye) - ok value, will need to test it out but $40 seems like a lot for a towel\n* $14.99 - [Keychain Mask](https://matadorup.com/products/keychain-mask) \\- don't find this to be much useful at all, especially with the quality of the mask. Might be able to stuff a better flimsy mask in here, or maybe repurpose to hold other stuff, but overall seems kinda pointless.\n* $9.99 - [Toothbrush Caps 2-Pack](https://matadorup.com/products/toothbrush-caps) \\- similarly, this seems pretty much useless. Might try this out with my electric toothbrush head if it fits any better/cleaner than the original provided plastic one, but can't say this is worth the normal retail $9.99.\n* $7.99 - [Waterproof Travel Canister](https://matadorup.com/products/waterproof-travel-canister-small) \\- not sure if I'll actually use this but I can see the utility. I don't typically carry enough medicine/pills with me to warrant this big of a \"canister\" but maybe I'll find a good use for it to carry other things as well.\n\nTotal retail value: $171.93",

        "selftext": "UPDATE: pulled the trigger on the Aer Gym Duffel 3 with the Travel Kit toiletry bag. \n\nMy only concern is the small 24L but watching the very few youtube reviews out there, it seems it might work for what i need it for. \n\nWill update on the quality of the bag when i receive it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nello!\n\nNeed your help on choosing the perfect weekend getaway duffel to pair with my new Aer Daypack 2 backpack. (which I absolutely LOVE). My tech and gear will stay in the Daypack. Shoes + clothes + CPAP machine will live in the duffel. I've narrowed down my choices to the following 4.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; trying to match with my Aer Daypack 2 which is why I'm trying to stick to Aer products, but it's not an absolute must. Shoe compartments are a plus, laptop compartments a plus. Would love it if anyone has real-world experiences with either bag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) [Aer Gym Duffel 3](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-3-black) **$169** \\---- 24.1L (17\" x 11.5\" x 9\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9l2y1vj6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc79be145ebf631f8a1bb2acca6801bca4e1076d\n\nThis one seems like the newest out of the families of Aer duffels, but also the smallest coming in at 24L. The shoe compartment is a big seller for me since I love that feature and prevents me from buying a shoe bag. I also like to keep my dirty clothes in there after the trip.\n\n* *Pros*: Matches with backpack, newer materials and improvements from the Duffel 2 (i think?), shoe compartment, brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons: S*maller than the others, more expensive. only one review on youtube from RushFaster\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) [Aer Gym Duffel 2](https://www.aersf.com/gym-duffel-2-black) **$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xhlbprkk6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca4f99188cdcb3986828a7d4f180d9c5356b2122\n\n**$136** on sale ----- **37.4L** (19\" x 13\" x 11\")\n\nI believe this is the version before the Gym Duffel 3, but some reason the size is way bigger.\n\n* *Pros:* shoe compartment, larger in size,brand uniformity with aer\n* *Cons:* older? maybe doesnt have some improvements in materials like the newer Duffel 3? Also another con is the zipper down the center, seems awkward. couldnt find any reviews online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.)  [Aer Travel Duffel](https://www.aersf.com/travel-duffel-black) **$170** \\---- **35L** (21.3\" x 12.6\" x 9.1\")\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ewyvwm7l6lu61.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e05290a837652c94f80846ff83269b68f0a6406\n\nThis is the one specifically for traveling with a huge bucket-style opening to dump clothes in. Although this one is considered the \"travel\" one, it don't like that it doesn't have the shoe compartment at least.\n\n* Pros: big bucket-style opening, nice handle, compression straps, brand uniformity with aer\n* Cons: no shoe compartment, the center-placed handle doesn't seem like it might handle a lot of weight if carried briefcase-style. few reviews online but everyone says it's decent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\\[removed peak design 35L since feedback has been so-so\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI love and appreciate your input!",

Your post does both and more, so thank you!\n\nPersonally, I'd go with the one that looks best with your Daypack and for me, that's the [Aer Travel Duffel](https://www.aersf.com/travel-duffel-black) \\- hands down.\n\nThe Gym Duffels look (as intended) like gym duffels. For travel, I think you want a more put-together look.\n\nRegarding the built-in shoe compartment: having a separate bag for your shoes is functionally the same (keeps the dirt off your clothes), looks cleaner (fewer external zippers), and is more versatile because you can leave it at home if you don't need an extra pair of shoes for your trip.\n\nThere are tons of high-quality, lightweight options for shoe bags too. I have one of these [Killspencer shoe bags, made of parachute material](https://killspencer.com/collections/bags/products/parachute-bag-2-0-shoe-bag?variant=18745161318462).\n\nAs for the Peak bag, I'm just not into the design, but if you're open to other brands, I love  /u/duncanjewett's suggestion for the [Bellroy Weekender](https://bellroy.com/products/weekender/baida_nylon/marine_blue#slide-0). I'm a huge fan of internal water bottle pockets, which that bag has, and the construction and features are all on point. It also comes in a larger size, called the [Weekender Plus](https://bellroy.com/products/weekender-plus/dura_nylon_recycled/black#slide-0).\n\nLet us know what you decide!",

There is no dedicated shoe compartment because PD makes a Shoe Pouch, is my guess. \n\nIf I had any criticism of it, it would be the carry handles. The magnets are a novel concept, but IRL they aren't strong enough to hold the handles together except under ideal circumstances. As a result, you've now got two magnetic strips as handles - they're narrow and not at all comfortable to carry through an airport or something. I eventually took mine off, and only use the shoulder strap (which is awesome) or the grab handles on the ends to carry it vertically. I guess you could also get something to wrap the carry handles (like a [Mr. Gripper](https://defybags.com/collections/accessories-1/products/mr-gripper-horween-cavalier-whiskey-leather), for example) and that would also solve that issue.\n\nEverything else I've enjoyed, these are good bags for the money.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I’ve been one bagging for a while with just whatever backpack I have on hand and would like to get something bigger (I mostly use a Fjallraven Kanken). \n\nWant lightweight, not too hikery looking, clamshell and some organization with room for a laptop, maybe 28l or 30?\n\nCame across the Matador [SEG30](https://matadorup.com/products/seg30-segmented-backpack?variant=39579693187185) and the [BEAST28 Ultralight](https://matadorup.com/collections/packable-bags/products/beast28-ultralight-technical-backpack). \n\nWondering if anyone has any experiences with these? They seem good both under 2lb. \n\nI also like the idea of their FlatPak Zipper toiletries case, which seems to be waterproof but also let moisture out which I thought was cool. \n\nMy only other “one bag” purchase was a big heavy (probably 4lb or more) TimBuk2 pack that I bought a few years ago and unfortunately just don’t end up using since it’s quite heavy, so trying to find a better fit this time. Open to other suggestions too! \n\nThanks!",

            "body": "I had Matadors for a few years. Love them. Others will hopefully chime in too.\n\nThe biggest thing to know with Matadors is to calibrate your expectations. They are very, very good and what they are _designed_ for. The problem is many folks try to use them in ways outside of the design.\n\n_What do I mean by that?_\n\nMatador bags get their structure from the way they are packed. They have no frame. It is just a really nice water repellant sack. And it does that VERY well.\n\nNot having a frame, or even a substantial foam back (if I'm remembering properly) is the big thing. You gotta know how to pack it so it rides well. The \"flexible frame suspension\" on the Beast28...if you look at it closely, you'll see that it helps the bag keep its shape on your back...but it doesn't _actually_ help transfer the weight of the load. And it doesn't provide a hard/semi-hard surface against your back, so you'd still feel any irregularities.\n\nI used cubes, a fleeces...for awhile I think I threw a frisbee in to give a solid surface against my back. It's all about knowing how to pack. \n\nAlso, there is zero impact protection. You get a moderate degree of abrasion resistance, and a high degree of water/dust resistance...but not much, at all, in the way of _impact_ protection. So you need to be aware of how you set it on the ground, not for the bag's sake, but for your contents.\n\nIf you travel with a laptop, you need a good sleeve.\n\nThe material they use for all their bags, it is durable, but it isn't like cordura or even cheap ballistic nylon. **The fabric is weaker than the stitching.** So if you snag a strap, it will pull out at the bar-tack, it'll rip the main body fabric and you might not be able to patch that.\n\n(Again -- **this is not the bag's fault**. The user needs to understand the design principles and choices of Matador, then ask, \"Can I adjust to this? Or should I get a different bag?\" Matador bags are, effectively, not unlike ultralight hiking gear -- you make some durability trade-offs to get the lighter weight...but if you know how to work with that, you get the benefits of the lighter weight.)\n\nHope some of that helps.\n\n_______\n\nAbout the two bags you mentioned:\n\n\n* **SEG30**\n\nI'd worry about putting in too much weight. But I also tend to push my bags to their limits.\n\nIt could be a great back-up bag in case you need to check something. Not sure I would trust it with baggage handlers. Too many loose straps.\n\nAgain, it's about understanding the design and not abusing the bag.\n\n\n* **BEAST28 Ultralight**\n\nSame thing, it's just about how much weight you're going to put into it. Terrific pack for what it does, but it is more of a \"Put the Beast28 in my primary 40L onebag, then get it out at my destination as a large day-pack.\"\n\nIf you used it as your primary onebag, for shorter trips, really -- no reason it wouldn't be great. You just gotta know how to pack it.\n\nFor longer trips, those same issues are amplified.",

Is the fabric super thin or something? All your points are completely fair ahaha but my current bag is the paper thin/horrible rope straps/absolutely no support of the kanken so I think anything will be an upgrade 😂 \nWhen I really think about it the bag does typically stay at the hotel as I’m out and about so dialing in on a good daypack also probably a good idea. \nThank you again :)",

The water reservoir in the 18 is a little tight for a laptop + sleeve, but I end up using my laptop as a structure for the back in the main compartment and pack around it. \n\nThis pack is super comfy to use when packed right. I can wear this all day with no issue, while other packs ended up fatiguing me / my back. Love that the waist strap is removable and have used the loops on the outside to hang Items while traveling. 18 is good for a weekend, but the 28 will likely afford you plenty of room for longer treks.\n\nI do wish storage was slightly more accessible, as the pack is taller than it is wide. But overall the beast is a great pack.",
