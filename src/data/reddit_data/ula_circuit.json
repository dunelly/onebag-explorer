Usually all my spare t-shirts and small clothing items will go into the Peak Design cube, then pants and outer layers get rolled and stuffed in whatever corner is free. Unfortunately, I do not have larger packing cubes, and they'd take up all of the space in some of the smaller bags' main compartments. \n\nMontbell Tri-Pack Mini at 18L holds exactly what I want, where I want. There's still 2 zippered compartments and one stash pouch in the main compartment for stashing small things. I have a sling, a shoulder bag, a laptop, and a set of sleepwear inside as \"luxury items.\" And the bag comfortably closes up.\n\nULA Spark is rated to 20L in the main compartment. Overstuffed and using the side pockets, it fits a bit more than that reasonably securely, I'd guess around 23-24L? This is *not* going to fit in a carry-on sizer though. \n\nTom Bihn Western Flyer struggled to fit the sling inside, but overall it *does* have noticeably more capacity than the Tri-Pack Mini. Those pants are bulky. About the same overall capacity as the Spark, but this is packed to the point that the bag is a little uncomfortable on my back. \n\nAnd finally, the MEC Vapour Overnighter fit everything besides that REI small packing cube. If I packed things in a bit tighter, the REI cube might make it in as well. The only place to stash small things like a phone or wallet are the front zip pocket, or opening up the entire bag and trying to access the laptop compartment suspended in the middle (which I didn't use).\n\nI am pretty disappointed that MEC didn't do another run of the Vapour line. It was a solid competitor to the Arc'teryx and Patagonia Black Hole lines of TPU laminated bags, the grippy lining texture just didn't make for a good daypack.",

            "body": "Backpack's I've tried thus far: \n\nA19 Whitley - Great features but small capacity and way too heavy at 3.25lbs. It got uncomfortably heavy for daypack use even though the harness itself was comfortable. I wore it during a 2 hour walk through a museum and my shoulders were crying. It's also bulky as hell because it has the thickest foam frames ever, like seriously overkill for a 20L daypack.\n\nEvergoods CHZ22 - Hated the laptop compartment being so annoying to access. Otherwise good features and moderately light. Returned because I just couldn't see myself using this in the long run with the bad laptop compartment design and low capacity - I couldn't imagine travelling to another domestic US city through Spirit Airlines (with their strict one personal bag rule) and using this backpack as a onebag.\n\nEnter the ULA Dragonfly - I think it's absolutely perfect. \n\n* It's lighter than even the CHZ22, it has higher capacity than both, it's damn comfortable surprisingly, it looks great in person. \n\n* Ranger Green X50 fabric - I think this looks way better in person than it does on ULA's websites. I thought it would be a light tan green, but no in person it's more like a deep olive color which I absolutely love. It's understated and stealthy. Btw, the pictures I took is a 1:1 match to what it looks like IRL. Also - last picture is comparison between VX21 Black vs Ranger Green. I think Ranger Green looks way better.\n\n* I just love the design philosophy of this backpack - it's simple, it doesn't go overboard on anything. It has a few simple compartments with zero frills. Every compartment feels roomy. Even the water bottle pockets are extra roomy. Big fan of ULA here.\n\n* The two mesh pockets behind the front panel are practical and keep small things well.\n\n* The top pocket is practical and easy to access. It's large. It does take up the main compartment though but at the very top where things are less likely to be packed up to.\n\n* Front most mesh pocket seems a bit useless? But it's there, it's deep, and can store stuff without going into the main compartment. No complaints here really. I'm just mainly scared because it's a mesh pocket so not waterproof.\n\n* Easiest laptop compartment access ever. It's there on the back of the backpack, you open one zip and it's a separate compartment that is very roomy. Just way better than the CHZ.\n\n* Shock cord can hold stuff outside the main compartment. It holds my rain jacket. On overnight trips I'm planning for it to hold a small towel.\n\n* The interior main panel tie-down straps are surprisingly useful. When you have a single big book in there you can tie it down and it hugs your back instead of swaying around.\n\n* I can 100% see myself using this as an EDC daypack, and 100% see myself using this as a travel one-bag backpack. I couldn't find a single backpack online that can do both. They're either too small, too heavy, too bulky. The ULA Dragonfly somehow straddles this thin line perfectly.\n\n* Cons: aquaguard zipper - not that big of a deal but it does feel stiffer than regular zippers.

            "body": "Backpack's I've tried thus far: \n\nA19 Whitley - Great features but small capacity and way too heavy at 3.25lbs. It got uncomfortably heavy for daypack use even though the harness itself was comfortable. I wore it during a 2 hour walk through a museum and my shoulders were crying. It's also bulky as hell because it has the thickest foam frames ever, like seriously overkill for a 20L daypack.\n\nEvergoods CHZ22 - Hated the laptop compartment being so annoying to access. Otherwise good features and moderately light. Returned because I just couldn't see myself using this in the long run with the bad laptop compartment design and low capacity - I couldn't imagine travelling to another domestic US city through Spirit Airlines (with their strict one personal bag rule) and using this backpack as a onebag.\n\nEnter the ULA Dragonfly - I think it's absolutely perfect. \n\n* It's lighter than even the CHZ22, it has higher capacity than both, it's damn comfortable surprisingly, it looks great in person. \n\n* Ranger Green X50 fabric - I think this looks way better in person than it does on ULA's websites. I thought it would be a light tan green, but no in person it's more like a deep olive color which I absolutely love. It's understated and stealthy. Btw, the pictures I took is a 1:1 match to what it looks like IRL. Also - last picture is comparison between VX21 Black vs Ranger Green. I think Ranger Green looks way better.\n\n* I just love the design philosophy of this backpack - it's simple, it doesn't go overboard on anything. It has a few simple compartments with zero frills. Every compartment feels roomy. Even the water bottle pockets are extra roomy. Big fan of ULA here.\n\n* The two mesh pockets behind the front panel are practical and keep small things well.\n\n* The top pocket is practical and easy to access. It's large. It does take up the main compartment though but at the very top where things are less likely to be packed up to.\n\n* Front most mesh pocket seems a bit useless? But it's there, it's deep, and can store stuff without going into the main compartment. No complaints here really. I'm just mainly scared because it's a mesh pocket so not waterproof.\n\n* Easiest laptop compartment access ever. It's there on the back of the backpack, you open one zip and it's a separate compartment that is very roomy. Just way better than the CHZ.\n\n* Shock cord can hold stuff outside the main compartment. It holds my rain jacket. On overnight trips I'm planning for it to hold a small towel.\n\n* The interior main panel tie-down straps are surprisingly useful. When you have a single big book in there you can tie it down and it hugs your back instead of swaying around.\n\n* I can 100% see myself using this as an EDC daypack, and 100% see myself using this as a travel one-bag backpack. I couldn't find a single backpack online that can do both. They're either too small, too heavy, too bulky. The ULA Dragonfly somehow straddles this thin line perfectly.\n\n* Cons: aquaguard zipper - not that big of a deal but it does feel stiffer than regular zippers. I think that's literally the only bad part of this backpack not gonna lie.",

            "body": "Backpack's I've tried thus far: \n\nA19 Whitley - Great features but small capacity and way too heavy at 3.25lbs. It got uncomfortably heavy for daypack use even though the harness itself was comfortable. I wore it during a 2 hour walk through a museum and my shoulders were crying. It's also bulky as hell because it has the thickest foam frames ever, like seriously overkill for a 20L daypack.\n\nEvergoods CHZ22 - Hated the laptop compartment being so annoying to access. Otherwise good features and moderately light. Returned because I just couldn't see myself using this in the long run with the bad laptop compartment design and low capacity - I couldn't imagine travelling to another domestic US city through Spirit Airlines (with their strict one personal bag rule) and using this backpack as a onebag.\n\nEnter the ULA Dragonfly - I think it's absolutely perfect. \n\n* It's lighter than even the CHZ22, it has higher capacity than both, it's damn comfortable surprisingly, it looks great in person. \n\n* Ranger Green X50 fabric - I think this looks way better in person than it does on ULA's websites. I thought it would be a light tan green, but no in person it's more like a deep olive color which I absolutely love. It's understated and stealthy. Btw, the pictures I took is a 1:1 match to what it looks like IRL. Also - last picture is comparison between VX21 Black vs Ranger Green. I think Ranger Green looks way better.\n\n* I just love the design philosophy of this backpack - it's simple, it doesn't go overboard on anything. It has a few simple compartments with zero frills. Every compartment feels roomy. Even the water bottle pockets are extra roomy. Big fan of ULA here.\n\n* The two mesh pockets behind the front panel are practical and keep small things well.\n\n* The top pocket is practical and easy to access. It's large. It does take up the main compartment though but at the very top where things are less likely to be packed up to.\n\n* Front most mesh pocket seems a bit useless? But it's there, it's deep, and can store stuff without going into the main compartment. No complaints here really. I'm just mainly scared because it's a mesh pocket so not waterproof.\n\n* Easiest laptop compartment access ever. It's there on the back of the backpack, you open one zip and it's a separate compartment that is very roomy. Just way better than the CHZ.\n\n* Shock cord can hold stuff outside the main compartment. It holds my rain jacket. On overnight trips I'm planning for it to hold a small towel.\n\n* The interior main panel tie-down straps are surprisingly useful. When you have a single big book in there you can tie it down and it hugs your back instead of swaying around.\n\n* I can 100% see myself using this as an EDC daypack, and 100% see myself using this as a travel one-bag backpack. I couldn't find a single backpack online that can do both. They're either too small, too heavy, too bulky. The ULA Dragonfly somehow straddles this thin line perfectly.\n\n* Cons: aquaguard zipper - not that big of a deal but it does feel stiffer than regular zippers. I think that's literally the only bad part of this backpack not gonna lie.",

I cut out the vertical piece of material around the entire pocket and sewed the pocket directly onto the main body of the backpack.

        "selftext": "This is my first post in this community so hi! I've been doing a lot of extensive research into backpacks and the perfect one bag for traveling - I don't see myself as an extreme minimalist or aim to travel ultra light but I am a bag nerd/enthusiast so I basically read every post on this subreddit when it came to the ULA Dragonfly before I made my purchase. I ended up getting the 30L Dragonfly in Green Robic (material may be relevant for discussion).\n\nI also want to stress that I love this bag. I paid an exorbitant amount for shipping + custom handling fees to the UK because I was convinced this would be the right bag for me. When it arrived, I loved everything about it - the look, the huge side pockets, the way it fit on my body. So I was really excited with me to Japan.\n\nWhich brings me to my current problem - I've just arrived in Kansai Airport. The bag has been with me on my body and in carry-on for less than 15 hours. I had my Trtl pillow attached to the front in a soft  bag so I didn't notice until my boyfriend pointed out some significant wear and tear on the front panel under the webbing. It's in a very specific zone and if I had to hazard a guess, it's from a few small travel sized toiletries I picked up at the airport and put into the inside webbed compartment of the front panel (not the actual front pocket, sorry if that's unclear. I mean when you unzip the main compartment and there's those two netted compartments on the inside). And somehow the plastic has been rubbing for a few hours on this front panel. It looks pretty bad - not sure how much the damage is just aesthetic vs structural, but it's really disappointing it's happened on literally my first trip/day and not what I expected from a brand that focuses on durability (I know it's not the MOST durable fabric in the range but...)\n\nObviously I've read a lot of comments here about how everyone loves their Dragonfly and abuse it and push it to its limits - but I'm really surprised that I haven't been able to find a single review or comment online about wear and tear to this front netting (I saw one comment about a hole in the water bottle compartment). I've reached out to the ULA team already (waiting for a response) but not feeling confident about my options since it wouldn't be easy to ship it back from the UK for repair, and generally speaking I've lost confidence in the durability of the bag.\n\nI'd love to know if anyone here has experienced similar issues or has any advice/feedback? Maybe I've made a mistake in putting the bottles where I did but I really really didn't expect that a few small bottles would cause this kind of damage, and so quickly at that. I don't feel like I've misused or overpacked the bag as it all zips up quite smoothly and everything else in the bag is in compressed packing cubes or are quite soft items. And I'd like to stress that I didn't even shove it under my seat - it was face up placed carefully in an airplane compartment at all times.\n\nThank you guys! Attaching some pics.",

I don’t see the characteristic shine on this fabric.\n\nI do agree that the fabric looks defective. There are little black nubs all over on the top and sides. Also the damage to the front looks like a snag.",

This wiggle room of adjustment is a really nice detail! Plus, the side pockets and outer mesh pocket are huge on the ULA. And their customer service is other worldly. You can actually talk to Peter if you need help. I prefer supporting a smaller company. It’s one of the top rated bags on the PCT as well and I hiked 300 miles with it across Sweden. But it all comes down to fit. Some people just really fit the GG Crown bag. I tried it on and it just wasn’t nearly as comfortable as ULA. My only gripe is that the mesh up against your back on the ULA can pick up little pine needles and debris and that the bag doesn’t stand upright when left alone. The idea being that it helps transfer the weight up against your back and helps with load transfer.  But if you’ve ever seen someone pack a Hyperlite where they leave their bag standing upright while grabbing items to fill their bag in the morning—you won’t be doing that with ULA lol. But that wasn’t a deal breaker for me. I often pack my bag while sitting in my tent.",

I cannot for the life of me understand why every pack does not have this feature. I use two of the 591mL Vitaminwater bottles, which have a perfect indent at the base to fit the bottom loop and then the top loop fits right in the groove under the cap, one on each shoulder, and it helps offset the weight of my pack. Sure, it looks a bit silly, but fuck off, no slapping around for your bottle in the side pockets and then contorting to get it back in. Just right there.\n\nCheers.",
