My favorites are Shilin and Raohe\n\n\\- Natural hot springs in BeiTou\n\n\\- Night life at XiMenDing\n\n\\- River tracing at Wulai\n\n\\- Huashan park has cool rotating art/technology exhibits\n\n\\- Walk out at the top of Taipei 101\n\n\\- Lots of good (though a bit overhyped) food around YongKong Jie - the original Din Tai Feng, Smoothie King, YongKang beef noodle, cheap onion pancakes, etc.\n\n\\- Boba, boba, boba. Boba shops on every other corner, and they're all good.",

        "title": "Review: Topo Designs Core Pack",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/8yggtp/review_topo_designs_core_pack/",
        "selftext": "I picked up the Topo Designs Core Pack a few months ago, and I have been using it both as my EDC bag as well as my onebag travel bag pretty consistently.  Now that I have some experience with it, I figured I'd give a detailed run down of my thoughts for other potential buyers.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**Volume** The Core Pack is marketed as a 20L bag. To give a sense of how much you can fit in this pack,[here is a loadout](https://i.imgur.com/wbiIpO3.jpg) from a weeklong business trip I went on recently using the Core Pack.  And [here](https://i.imgur.com/8D7ZlMt.jpg) are a [few angles](https://i.imgur.com/WaCG7OM.jpg) of the bag fully packed (minus the jeans and brown shoes, although these could fit).  With this load, the bag is pretty full, but not bulging.\n\n**Organization** - The Core Pack is a [panel loader](https://i.imgur.com/jfpO92C.jpg), which I like a lot for travel as its easy to pack and access.  Unlike many panel loaders, however, the Core Pack doesn't seem oddly voluminous when fairly empty, which is great when using it as a EDC bag. The bag is lined with bright yellow 210D coated pack cloth, which makes it really easy to discriminate between your things visually.  The [front panel pocket](https://i.imgur.com/q3Npz3A.jpg) holds is easily accessible by slinging the bag around onto one shoulder, and has 2 sub pockets (one mesh, one solid), pen slots, and a key ring.  The [small top pocket](https://i.imgur.com/S58iVjY.jpg) is nice for easy and separate access to your phone/wallet/passport.  The [laptop panel](https://i.imgur.com/CPbZ5ee.jpg) is easily large enough to fit my 15'' macbook pro along with my journal and kindle.  There are [water bottle pockets](https://i.imgur.com/72weS7S.jpg) on both sides of the bag.  These are low enough to be reasonably accessible without taking off the bag, and are [pulled flat when empty](https://i.imgur.com/7J7I7za.jpg).  The bag comes with a [webbing strap waist belt](https://i.imgur.com/HF2ic32.jpg) that is easily detached with simple but fairly sturdy [clips](https://i.imgur.com/xrI8ZyA.jpg).  It also has a [webbing sternum strap](https://i.imgur.com/Mpgi80s.jpg) that can be [adjusted up and down](https://i.imgur.com/0hZ5qyA.jpg).\n\n**Cost** This is a relatively inexpensive option compared to many of the other bags seen on this sub, [coming in at just $129](https://topodesigns.com/products/core-pack).  This makes it a pretty good option for those not ready to commit to a ~$300 bag for one reason or another.  On top of that, I happened across a 20% off coupon, so it ended up being ~$100 total for me.  Also, the guy in the shop threw in a cool Topo Designs water bottle because I was a first time customer, and offered me a beer while I was checking out gear.\n\n**Build Quality** The pack is constructed from 1000D nylon so it can probably withstand a beating fairly well.  All of the zippers are YKK, with the [chunky heavy duty ones](https://i.imgur.com/7kiJEA6.jpg) for the main panel and the laptop compartments, and slightly smaller versions for the top pocket and front panel.  The [back panel](https://i.imgur.com/8o4saxL.jpg) is fairly padded, flexible, but with [enough rigidity](https://i.imgur.com/yd8mmxT.jpg) that it stands on its own when empty.  The shoulder straps are [thickly padded](https://i.imgur.com/qn1BTLT.jpg) and comfy.  All of the sewing seems to be done with [single straight stitches](https://i.imgur.com/lknyHcx.jpg), with the exception of the shoulder strap attachments, which seem to be [tight single zigzag stitches](https://i.imgur.com/GpFawS7.jpg).  As to the the structural integrity of the shoulder strap attachments, I haven't had any problems, but the details of the attachment are hidden away behind the pack cloth in the laptop compartment.  Also, I don't know a lot about sewing.\n\n**Complaints/Potential Improvements**\n\n* There isn't a lot of padding at the bottom of the laptop compartment, so you need to be somewhat careful setting the bag down, or your laptop will bump directly into the ground.\n\n* The subpockets within the front panel are small enough that they are hard to dexterously explore when the bag is fairly full.  This is partially because the sub-pockets are small, and partially because the front panel does not have dedicated volume.  I think having one larger subpocket would be better.\n\n* The bag has ice-axe loops which serve no practical purpose as attachments. That said, Topo Design's founder told me that the axe loops are a signature of the brand, which started out making mountaineering oriented gear.\n\n* I'm uncertain about the waterproofness of the bag, particularly the laptop compartment.  I've carried the bag through a couple of downpours (sans laptop), and the amount of water that got in seemed to be minimal, but the flaps over the zippers aren't extensive enough to really prevent water from interacting with the zipper and possibly intruding into the compartment.  Using waterproof zippers or having a slightly larger flap could be a good solution to this.\n\n--------------------\n\n**Tl;dr** The Topo Designs Core Pack is an excellent onebag for both everyday use and travel if you load is on the minimal side.  It is well built and organized, and comes in at only $130, making it a great midrange budget bag.\n\nedit: typos and such.\n\nedit 2: added point about rainproof-ness\n\nedit 3: added details and pictures of the waist and sternum straps\n\nedit 4: corrected the volume of the pack (25L-&gt;20L)",

They've got a [travel bag](https://topodesigns.com/products/travel-bag) in two sizes that are meant to work (optionally) in conjunction with their [trip pack](https://topodesigns.com/collections/bags/products/trip-pack), but I think there are some flaws with that particular design.  IMO the core pack is the best they have at the moment for onebag travel.\n\nEdit: I actually just went into the Topo Design shop to look at their new version of the travel bag which is 30L (originally it was only 40L).  They have fixed pretty much all of the issues I had with the original, and I have to say, in some ways the new travel bag may be better than the core pack for onebag travelers.  Just putting that out there for anyone who comes across this as a reference.",

After seeing me onebag on the trips we’ve taken together, she started to embraced the idea on her own for short weekend road trips. This week we took a five day trip to Nashville for her to attend a work event, which was her first time onebagging for a flight and for that long of a trip - and she surpassed me in her packing! Not only is this the longest trip she’s onebagged for, she packed all of her professional clothes and that too in a 25L topo core pack!\n\nMeanwhile I’m over here packed out to lounge and WFH from our Airbnb using the CHZ26 (which definitely feels bigger than 26L) 😂\n\nThe best part was seeing her realize in real-time how fantastic onebag travel can be - not having to worry about boarding early to secure overhead space, being free to use stairs at the airport if the escalator was way too crowded, being able to go straight from the airport to Hattie B’s hot chicken for lunch without hassle / checking out of our Airbnb and being able to spend the day exploring before heading to the airport. She got so excited by the freedom it afforded us on this trip, and I think she’s fully converted after this trip 😛\n\nJust wanted to share how proud I am of her for embracing it in the way she did for this trip!",

I wound up giving it a negative review on the website because they advertised a yellow interior for all the models and I received one with a black interior (even after I emailed customer service before purchasing to confirm that all models had a yellow interior). Customer service took a month to update the product page to clarify the black model had a black interior and falsely advertised all models having a yellow interior during their big holiday sales). They also wound up deleting my negative review a few weeks after I posted it - which I think partially explains why so many Topo products have 5 star reviews. Again, seems like a durable bag, but very turned off by the company’s unethical practices.",

            "body": "I have this bag and recently used it on a trip to Europe and NYC. I too was surprised by the all-black interior (instead of the yellow in the pictures) which makes this bag very difficult to use in low light conditions, especially the mesh zippered compartments. You will be absolutely blind. I hate it. Now the website has a note about this, but it didn't when I got my bag.\n\nPros: The half hardcase, half soft exterior lets you pack fragile items safely. Be aware that if stuffed full it can get bigger than strict carry-on size. There are a LOT of sections / zippers / layers. If you underpack a bit, the bag is flexible - I could easily keep a down jacket, my raincoat, scarf, gloves, hat and a lightweight tote in the section between the admin panel and the main bag. The included shoulder straps are lightweight and easy to take along, but I would only use them in an emergency where I had to carry the bag, and only for a short distance. The red wheels are cool and distinctive. The bag is tough and able to be checked without damage. \n\nCons: You'll need to only pack flat things in the outside zipper pocket and in the admin panel section; there's not a lot of extra room. The top strap &amp; buckle to attach another bag just gets in the way and there is no way to stow it; I cut it off. The zippers are not lockable - you can stow the zippers beyond a fabric loop that makes it harder to open the bag, but it makes it hard for you to open it too - I just got a long wire lock and clipped the ends of the four zippers together. Used as a carry-on, because there are no compression straps, if you overpack the bag it may become too fat for strict airlines. I had to gate-check it on a US regional airliner, and in a Delta 777 it only fit sideways in the overhead compartment. I checked it coming home and it came through without a scratch. \n\nI found this bag to be flexible and tough. If you don't overpack it, you can use all of the zippered sections, which seem a bit fussy but can be very helpful for organization when you are living out of the bag.",

The telescoping handle is solid and you can put a heavy duffle over it to roll along. I like that you can get a Core Pack that matches it (and maybe others backpacks?).

The way it's designed with just the two wheels rather than four, it has two little bumper stops toward the front on the bottom so it sits flush when you want to stand it up to rest on its own. Mine kept on toppling forward, even when I'd load my heavy gear on the far inside / wheel side. I reached out to their customer service folks to ask about it and they were exceptionally cool and helpful, offered to replace it. I ended up fixing it by unzipping the little maintenance zipper inside where the bumper stops are mounted with a bolt and threaded nut and I re-drilled holes 1/4\" outward and forward to give it a bit wider stance and footprint, and this solved the issue completely for me. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this, but I thought I'd mention it just incase it helps someone else. It's very nearly a perfect carry-on bag. The backpack straps also work great, and are a super nice feature for when you're really trying to hustle through traffic, or traveling through different kinds of terrain where rolling it isn't practical, and it's too far to lug it with the handles.",

        "selftext": "My trusty Topo Designs Core 25L backpack has finally begun showing its age. While the compartments are fine, the straps and back padding are shot from being dragged all over the world with me for work and are killing me when I wear it.  Since Topo no longer makes this backpack, I’m trying to find something comparable, durable (this one is 6 years old), and with some style. Was looking at Carhartt Work In Progress Philis, Fjalraven Raven 28, and the Carhartt 28L dual compartment backpack. None of which really seem both stylish and functional. Hoping to find something functional and professional, but still reflecting my style (lots of Carhartt Work in Progress, Vans, and Topo Designs, but don’t want something that looks like I’m climbing Everest or going to class… thanks!\n\nMy normal pack list for my work as a mechanic for a private aircraft is as follows:\nWork Laptop\nPersonal Laptop\niPad\nSteamdeck\nBag of chargers and accessories \n32oz Water bottle\nSmall assortment of hand tools and flashlight (carried in a zippered pouch)\n",
