It‚Äôs a combination of the straps pulling on the ruck where they are reinforced when it‚Äôs packed out, and the top strap reinforcement begging to tear. Cordura rucks can be packed out all day, everyday and laugh and keep going. It‚Äôs not gonna rip. Waxed canvas while still tough, is more prone to potential rips‚Äîeven when all it holds are two laptops, a trapperkeeper and a wiredopp.\n\nI think it may be just due to the fact that the straps on the Heritage are sewn in up and down at the top of the ruck, rather than sewn in slightly angled out to account for the wearer putting it on their back. Or it may just be weaker materials when compared to Cordura.",

        "title": "My GR1 21 initial thoughts vs CT21 Tanker",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Goruck/comments/1936xl5/my_gr1_21_initial_thoughts_vs_ct21_tanker/",
        "selftext": "My new GR1 21 was delivered yesterday to Scotland. Considering I only ordered it on Friday, it was a super quick delivery.\n\nHere are a few of my initial 24-hour thoughts, taking into account that I've been using the $89 [CT21 1000D Tanker](https://ctactical.vn/products/ct21-v2-0-the-tanker-1000d-cordura-nylon) for the past few months as my EDC work bag and for general weekends. So, I'll make a few comparisons based on the big cost difference between the two bags ($89 vs $335).\n\n1. Sizing and weight:\n\nI'm 6'1\" and the 21L is the ideal size for my minimal EDC, including my 14\" MBP. The bag sits just above my belt, and I feel that if I had gone for the 26L, it would have rubbed against my belt and possibly caused issues over time, especially when walking a lot.\n\nThe weight of the bag initially shocked me in a good way. It was a lot lighter than I was expecting. I had read many reviews saying it was a heavy bag, but I think the CT21 Tanker is far heavier due to being double-lined and its use of various materials, which adds to the weight.\n\nThe GR1 is a Tardis for space, and I wasn't expecting it to be much bigger than the CT21 since they are both 21L bags. However, the main compartment of the GR1 is more of a square shape, and there is less of a slope from the bottom to the top of the bag, which allows for more space at the top. The CT21 is a lot shallower at the top and doesn't allow the same high items to sit at the top. This is frustrating when quickly stuffing your jacket, etc., into the bag as it feels really tight at the top. Since the GR1 is single-lined, the material is more fluid and less stiff than the CT21, which helps fit more into the bag.\n\nThe laptop compartment on the GR1 feels slightly smaller because it has a false bottom, which is nice. It gives that extra assurance that the bag can be put down without directly impacting the laptop. It fits my 14\" MBP fine and still has a few inches to spare, but I think the 16\" MBP might be slightly tight.\n\n2. Materials and quality:\n\nThe GR1 is all 1000D Cordura, with the exception of the 210D back panel and back of the straps. This actually feels quite cheap and looks very shiny. It's also slippery on clothes. The CT21 is similar with 1000D Cordura, but it has a 420D on the back and back of the straps, this blends in better with the bag and doesn't stand out like the 210D does, so I actually prefer this more.\n\nThe interior of the GR1 is all 1000D, and this is where the bag feels a little cheap compared to the CT21. It feels rough inside, especially within the laptop compartment and pouch within the main compartment. The CT21 has lined these with a fleece lining for better device protection.\n\nThe CT21 interior is lined with an orange ripstop 210D, which is softer and smoother than the GR1's 1000D. The CT21 top zip pocket on the clamshell is double-lined, so it feels a little more protected. You cannot see the stitching of the CTactical badge inside the pocket, whereas you can see the stitching of the GR1 badge inside the pocket, and that cheapens it a little, ideally I would like this to be a strong pocket so keys etc. don't feel like they'll break the pocket.\n\nMolle quality on the CT21 is low, which is a shame. The GR1 molle stands out as it's solid, and nothing is coming loose. The CT21 came with a sternum strap, which was nice, but I purchased the $10 Goruck one with the bag and I'm glad I did, it is such a good, thick strap and makes the CT21 strap look cheap. It's definitely a great value purchase. The internal molle on the GR1 is also great and versatile, and it's made with the same quality as the exterior, so it's solid!\n\nFrom a quality point of view, I was blown away by the CT21 when I first got it. The bag's stitching and zipper movement are top-notch. I wasn't blown away by the GR1. The quality is disappointing, and the amount of loose threads makes me worry that they will all come loose one day. There are random loose threads all over the bag, and I'm not sure how to treat them. I don't want to send it back due to the high shipping fees until it totally falls apart. The zippers on the GR1 will take a bit of breaking in and are not as smooth as the CT21 due to the rain covers over the zippers. The rain covers are a great addition but hinder the zipping process a little, especially on the corners of the main compartment.\n\n3. Pricing and general thoughts:\n\nPricing is a topic that is mentioned a lot when searching for Goruck. Everyone has their own opinions on it. Should it be based on quality, functionality, or something else? If it was based on quality alone, then it doesn't match the price. They could probably mass produce it for less and sell it for less to make more money. More people would buy it if the price was cheaper, but this would cheapen the brand and hinder its growth.\n\nFor myself, out of the loads of bags I've purchased, I've realised that simplicity is the key I've strived for in the perfect bag. The GR1 is that ideal bag for me. It isn't over the top with thousands of pockets and organisation. It's clean, minimal, and full of potential thanks to the large compartment and internal and external molle. The laptop compartment is secure and hidden out of the way, so it doesn't take up much space. Therefore, it's perfect for both work and non-work purposes. You can forget it's there and not worry about it infringing on the internal compartment space.",

        "title": "My GR1 21 initial thoughts vs CT21 Tanker",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Goruck/comments/1936xl5/my_gr1_21_initial_thoughts_vs_ct21_tanker/",
        "selftext": "My new GR1 21 was delivered yesterday to Scotland. Considering I only ordered it on Friday, it was a super quick delivery.\n\nHere are a few of my initial 24-hour thoughts, taking into account that I've been using the $89 [CT21 1000D Tanker](https://ctactical.vn/products/ct21-v2-0-the-tanker-1000d-cordura-nylon) for the past few months as my EDC work bag and for general weekends. So, I'll make a few comparisons based on the big cost difference between the two bags ($89 vs $335).\n\n1. Sizing and weight:\n\nI'm 6'1\" and the 21L is the ideal size for my minimal EDC, including my 14\" MBP. The bag sits just above my belt, and I feel that if I had gone for the 26L, it would have rubbed against my belt and possibly caused issues over time, especially when walking a lot.\n\nThe weight of the bag initially shocked me in a good way. It was a lot lighter than I was expecting. I had read many reviews saying it was a heavy bag, but I think the CT21 Tanker is far heavier due to being double-lined and its use of various materials, which adds to the weight.\n\nThe GR1 is a Tardis for space, and I wasn't expecting it to be much bigger than the CT21 since they are both 21L bags. However, the main compartment of the GR1 is more of a square shape, and there is less of a slope from the bottom to the top of the bag, which allows for more space at the top. The CT21 is a lot shallower at the top and doesn't allow the same high items to sit at the top. This is frustrating when quickly stuffing your jacket, etc., into the bag as it feels really tight at the top. Since the GR1 is single-lined, the material is more fluid and less stiff than the CT21, which helps fit more into the bag.\n\nThe laptop compartment on the GR1 feels slightly smaller because it has a false bottom, which is nice. It gives that extra assurance that the bag can be put down without directly impacting the laptop. It fits my 14\" MBP fine and still has a few inches to spare, but I think the 16\" MBP might be slightly tight.\n\n2. Materials and quality:\n\nThe GR1 is all 1000D Cordura, with the exception of the 210D back panel and back of the straps. This actually feels quite cheap and looks very shiny. It's also slippery on clothes. The CT21 is similar with 1000D Cordura, but it has a 420D on the back and back of the straps, this blends in better with the bag and doesn't stand out like the 210D does, so I actually prefer this more.\n\nThe interior of the GR1 is all 1000D, and this is where the bag feels a little cheap compared to the CT21. It feels rough inside, especially within the laptop compartment and pouch within the main compartment. The CT21 has lined these with a fleece lining for better device protection.\n\nThe CT21 interior is lined with an orange ripstop 210D, which is softer and smoother than the GR1's 1000D. The CT21 top zip pocket on the clamshell is double-lined, so it feels a little more protected. You cannot see the stitching of the CTactical badge inside the pocket, whereas you can see the stitching of the GR1 badge inside the pocket, and that cheapens it a little, ideally I would like this to be a strong pocket so keys etc. don't feel like they'll break the pocket.\n\nMolle quality on the CT21 is low, which is a shame. The GR1 molle stands out as it's solid, and nothing is coming loose. The CT21 came with a sternum strap, which was nice, but I purchased the $10 Goruck one with the bag and I'm glad I did, it is such a good, thick strap and makes the CT21 strap look cheap. It's definitely a great value purchase. The internal molle on the GR1 is also great and versatile, and it's made with the same quality as the exterior, so it's solid!\n\nFrom a quality point of view, I was blown away by the CT21 when I first got it. The bag's stitching and zipper movement are top-notch. I wasn't blown away by the GR1. The quality is disappointing, and the amount of loose threads makes me worry that they will all come loose one day. There are random loose threads all over the bag, and I'm not sure how to treat them. I don't want to send it back due to the high shipping fees until it totally falls apart. The zippers on the GR1 will take a bit of breaking in and are not as smooth as the CT21 due to the rain covers over the zippers. The rain covers are a great addition but hinder the zipping process a little, especially on the corners of the main compartment.\n\n3. Pricing and general thoughts:\n\nPricing is a topic that is mentioned a lot when searching for Goruck. Everyone has their own opinions on it. Should it be based on quality, functionality, or something else? If it was based on quality alone, then it doesn't match the price.
