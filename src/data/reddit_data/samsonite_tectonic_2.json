        "selftext": "Hi! I've been on the search for a travel/work backpack and have landed on these 4 options that would meet my needs. Would love to hear any feedback/thoughts!\n\nRequirements:\n- Separate laptop compartment\n- Trolley sleeve\n- Front zippered pockets\n- Side pockets for water bottle/umbrella\n- Comfortable shoulder straps\n- Not too sporty looking\n\nNot a necessity but nice to have:\n- Interior organization pockets (in this case, only Samsonite lacks this)\n\nI was originally leaning towards the Away Large Featherlight backpack but it is the smallest of the 4 (18L vs Samsonite 21L, Lululemon 22L and Away Commuter 25L), and the straps seem to be the least comfortable/padded.

My only complaint might be that it has *too many* small pockets for organization. It's smaller than some of the ones you have listed (the one I have is 19L) but they have multiple sizes I think. \n\nI've found it to be pretty comfortable to carry even when it's heavy (I'm also petite and 5' 2\"), and the quality of the material and hardware is really good.",

I packed him extended(to not actively hide him like how Brandon Baker did it in his travel video) in my backpack and it went off without a hitch.

I would like to see if anyone has had a similar or dissimilar experience traveling with AL on carry on.\n\nAnd the white balisong is my shuiddy(shit squirt that I 3d printed as a backup in case ALBERT was confiscated) as my squiddy B wouldn’t arrive in time for my business trip.",

            "body": "Hello,\n\nI am looking for suggestions and recommendations for a new backpack to house my new laptop, a [Lenovo ThinkPad T72](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-p/ThinkPad-P72/p/22WS2WPWP72).  \n\nFor the past decade, I have been using a Tumi Alpha T-Pass Business Class Brief Pack with multiple laptops (ThinkPad P61p, W510, W530, and currently a P50), but the new P72's dimensions are 16.4×11.1×1.2\" (416×281x31 mm), so it does not fit.  I have a Briggs &amp; Riley @Work Clamshell backpack that I use with a ThinkPad P51s, but that does not fit, either.\n\nMy [laptop collection](https://imgur.com/WRxLPmk) is stored in backpacks (or over-the-shoulder the bags for the smallest models and tablets), but all of the backpacks max out at carrying a 15.6\" laptop.\n\nI suppose I am what you would call a \"heavy\" (as opposed to a \"light\") traveler.  My EDC contains everything I need to work remotely for an extended period, as you can see in [this picture](https://imgur.com/czkaMHq) of my backpack's contents.  So, I am looking for a backpack that will carry at least as much.  \n\nIn keeping with the sidebar rules, here are some criteria:\n\nCriteria|Description\n----|----|\nSize | holds 17.3\" laptop and accessories; the more pockets and compartments, the better\nUsage | office plus travel\nColor | Black, blue or other dark/neutral color\nMaterial | nylon, rugged construction\nWarranty | 10+ years or lifetime preferred\nPrice | 400USD (willing to go higher if needed)\nOther | **must** be [TSA Checkpoint Friendly](https://www.tsa.gov/news/releases/2008/08/15/checkpoint-friendly-laptop-bag-procedures) due to travel\n\nSince my luggage has wheels, I am not looking for a wheeled backpack. A trolley sleeve to slip over the luggage's handle would be okay, but is not actually needed.  I specifically want to **avoid** anything that looks *tacticool*, as the backpack will be accompanying me to the office, conferences and other professional venues.\n\nHere are some fo the backpacks I have been looking at online:\n\nVendor | Model | Cost | Comments\n----|----|----|----|\nBriggs &amp;

        "selftext": "I am looking for a backpack to replace my everyday leather Feed bag tote, which I loved, but is too heavy when loaded and tends to fall off my shoulder. My needs are- \n\nProfessional look- good enough to carry to client meetings. \n\nNeither too masculine nor too feminine- as I’m a woman in a traditionally male field, albeit one relatively well integrated in my generation and on down. I typically don’t like obviously feminine designs and colorways as a matter of personal taste. \n\nHold and organize items my typical max carrying load- Surface and charger, e-Reader, cables/earbuds, Wet Ones pack, hand cream, a few small cosmetics, a 7x9x1 daily planner, my overstuffed pen bag (2x2x10), and up to 3” of documents in file folders/ expandable files. \n\nAfter a lot of searching, here are my top 3 (all prices comparable):\n\n1- Tumi Voyageur Celina - this ticks all the boxes at the lightest weight. The lighter weight comes at the trade off of material. I really wanted to stay with leather but the vast majority of products in this space are not leather. I’m a bit worried about durability. However, Tumi’s nylon looks better than, for instance Lo&amp;Sons, which looks stressed and shiny in even its own website photos. \n\n2- Poppy Barley - material upgrade to leather at the cost of some organizational pockets compared to the Celina, and additional weight. Has an expandable bottom for additional capacity. The dual tote handles allow me to carry in a briefcase style (albeit vertically) if I am in a setting where a backpack feels casual. I don’t see much in the way of third party reviews. I can’t tell if, even expanded, it’s large enough (the capacity when expanded is reported at 16L).\n\n3-Waterfield tech folio backpack - I don’t love any of the colorways as borderline too masculine/rough for me/my field. I do lean towards the waxed canvas in spite of this because I think it would be more durable and it is consistent with some old school soft-sided briefcases common in my field/region (whereas no one uses briefcases made of nylon). This bag could fill a second use for overnight travel, but it’s not a common enough issue to drive the purchase. Flip side of that is that I worry it will look baggier/less professional when not full, but the slim size won’t provide enough space for document heavy days. \n\nWould love your thoughts, experiences, or regrets with these bags, brands, or decision making with similar factors.  Thanks!",

            "body": "I really like waterfield bags in general, Their stutter sling (small size) is great and holds way more that I expected it to. It's generally my under-the-seat bag when traveling and I fill it with a sweatshirt, my steamdeck, tablet, earbuds, etc. It's also the bag I bring on my day trips walking around the city, etc.    \nIncredibly durable, support from the company is great (I emailed them asking about internal sizing before buying the sling, asking if a steam deck would fit inside. I was fully expecting for them to have no idea but they replied the same day, said a steam deck does fit inside and they were working on cases for them too). \n\nThat tech folio backpack also looks exactly like what I was looking for a month or two ago, but somehow I missed it when searching their site.  I ended up with a nomatic backpack instead which seams pretty nice so far, but is very heavy even when empty. \n\nOne thing I will say about that waterfield bag is to check the weight before you buy it. The stutter sling has a thick piece of leather on it that is pretty heavy even on the small sling, and I'd imagine that bag has a similar piece on the front.",

It has an outside horizontal compartment, an admin compartment, a main compartment. And a laptop compartment - not padded nor does it have a false bottom but I use a laptop sleeve. It also has two ‘water-bottle’ holders. There are two slim carrying handles on too, one is sewn at the front and one at the back. They can be ‘combined’ with an attached miniclip. Not YKK or aqua guard or anything. It’s all black, minimal branding just like yours. If I can figure out how to attach a pic. Honestly probably THE best bang-for-my-money purchase.
