I got it thinking Elliot is a pretty easy cosplay to pull off. I started using it because I wanted it to look worn and used if I ever did decide to dress up as Elliot. I've used it for 6 months now and it's great.\n\nThe price is pretty stunning. I'm used to spending at least $100 or more for a good backpack, so I didn't know what to expect on this one quality wise. But it's huge, it's comfortable, and it has held up really well for daily use. I'm not sure if it's exactly the one Elliot has in the show, but all of the details I've been able to spy on the show (straps, cinches, etc) all line up. \n\nWhat I really love is that the laptop pocket isn't really an inner pocket. It's up against your back, but it's not in the zippered portions. There's just a velcro pocket that it slips in. It's very secure, though, and I like it because it means no crumbs or other debris gets in the laptop pocket like I've experienced with other backpacks. \n\nIMO, you can't beat it for the price. Mine came with a flag velcro attachment. I took that off, but otherwise, I use it as is.",
