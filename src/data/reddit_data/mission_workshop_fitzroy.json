I use the TD35 constantly with a CPL24 for 2-bag travel, with a backpack and duffel which both need to be below 7.5KG as is increasingly the requirement of most major international airlines. I usually hand carry the TD35 - it is a much better hand carry than the transit or anything I’ve ever used. I use the strap mainly when need stop restroom or free my hands at different places and don’t want to put the bag on the ground (which I generally don’t hesitate to do outside of a restroom).\n\nThe MW is not great as a side bag - won’t stay on the shoulder well and is less effective at hand carry -  but is superb as a one or 1.5 bag solution. The classic messenger strap is superb in this use case and is the best comfort you’re going to find without going to a backpack. You need to make the weight work and in this use case I’d also consider a 25 - 35L backpack strongly. The MW is also the best in rough / nasty environments - utterly bombproof and monsoon proof. The TD35 has never failed me in moderately bad conditions, but the MW has 2 layers of water protection and a tougher / easier to clean exterior fabric. \n\nWhat I do when flying with one bag (either the MW Transit or a backpack) is always have a packable duffel or backpack in my main bag , and if staff call me on weight I toss a few packing cubes into the packable bag to maximize my 15KG total allowance. Then after the weight, I toss the packable bag back into the main bag (preferably while staring the airline staff down). \n\nSummary of my use: \n\nSide-bag for clothes and non-tech gear during flight travel - TD35 all the way\n\n1-bag travel with a duffel - MW transit is the best I’ve found, also best if slugging around in SEA or Central America during rainy season.\n\nThese two duffels make all my other duffels mostly useless - as they cover most use cases.

The VX bags do hold their shape better, are more weatherproof, and nearly indestructible in my experience. It's a more durable and easily cleaned exterior and to me it just depends on how you feel about the bag's appearance, outside durability.\n\nMy go-to for cleaning the bag interiors is simply warm water + dish soap. You can add Dr Bronners soap, white vinegar, and maybe some alcohol for an added cleanse if just dish soap doesn't do the trick. Use a cleansing cloth or sponge, then rinse out with warm water. I just clean them in the bath tub. This has gotten some serious mud stains out of my yellow vx speedwell post-bikepacking. Haven't had mold issues but worth a shot if you haven't tried this already",

Briefcases can be hard or soft (but are more often soft these days), and are typically a bit smaller than a messenger but tend to be more formal. They're usually designed with gussets, which traditionally would be used for holding papers, but they're more likely to be made to hold a laptop these days. They'll tend to have clips or buckles and possibly side pockets instead of the large flap messengers have. \n\nIn terms of formality, I'd say leather definitely wins over canvas. The big thing is you want a clean design, and probably subdued colors. Something that looks overly \"techy\" doesn't look all that professional. Even if it's basically a laptop bag, you don't want it to look like one, with things like rubber feet on the bottom. \n\nAs for backpacks...given their association with academia, they're just never not going to look juvenile. Which if you're a college student is fine, but if you're walking into an office with a suit on, it just doesn't work. I'd say a nice briefcase is a great way to complete a professional outfit. ",
