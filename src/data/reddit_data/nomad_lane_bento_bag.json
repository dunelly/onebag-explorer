Thats like 5 bags to pack just for Friday night to Monday morning every week and she has to walk up a hill to get to my apartment from the car.\n\nHer duffel bag is old and falling apart so it would be nice to get her something stylish and practical to bring for the weekend that she could also repurpose for travel.\n\nMy budget is ~ $200\n\nHere's a few I've been looking at but I'm open to recommendations:\n\n1.

[AWAY Large Everywhere Bag](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/large-everywhere-bag?color=coast_nylon) - bonus points for a fun color,  leather straps and free customization but also the heaviest = least practical \n\n4. [Stella Mccartney for Adidas Nylon Travel Bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/luggage-and-travel/stella-mccartney-for-adidas-nylon-duffle-bag-hu6b7) -she showed me this one many months ago because she liked the color but it's sold out and I've had bad experiences buying her pre-owned gifts before.",

She does carry a lot, sometimes commuting with a duffel is more challenging than a backpack. The fact that she brings a tote with her items she wants to quickly reach tells me she probably won‚Äôt consolidate into just one duffel anyways, she probably likes not having to unpack her work bag just for a weekend and the tiny purse probably just packs into her duffel so she doesn‚Äôt have to carry anything huge. Lo&amp;Sons does not have any sort of padded sleeve or pouch for her personal laptop if she were to want to pack that bag in with her clothes. I think if you replace her duffel, it‚Äôs still only going to replace her duffel. She might still be a bag lady lol. Might be worth talking to her and see if she has a goal to condense, and if so, if she‚Äôs been eyeing anything in particular (that isn‚Äôt sold out lol).",

I've started calling her Bag Lady because she brings her work laptop bag, a duffel bag with clothes, a tote bag with her phone/waterbottle/book, her personal laptop bag for her fiction writing, and a tiny telfar purse for going out. Thats like 5 bags to pack just for Friday night to Monday morning every week and she has to walk up a hill to get to my apartment from the car.\n\nHer duffel bag is old and falling apart so it would be nice to get her something stylish and practical to bring for the weekend that she could also repurpose for travel.\n\nMy budget is ~ $200\n\nHere's a few I've been looking at but I'm open to recommendations:\n\n1. [LO &amp; SONS Catalina Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/products/catalina-deluxe-organic-canvas-dove-grey) -its big and budget friendly but not very stylish\n\n2. [Nomad Lane Bento Bag](https://nomadlane.com/products/the-bento-bag) -very practical but it might be too professional for our usual Netflix&amp;chill type weekend + over budget\n\n3. [AWAY Large Everywhere Bag](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/large-everywhere-bag?color=coast_nylon) - bonus points for a fun color,  leather straps and free customization but also the heaviest = least practical \n\n4. [Stella Mccartney for Adidas Nylon Travel Bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/luggage-and-travel/stella-mccartney-for-adidas-nylon-duffle-bag-hu6b7) -she showed me this one many months ago because she liked the color but it's sold out and I've had bad experiences buying her pre-owned gifts before.",

        "selftext": "Handbag homies! \n\nPlease help me buy my gf a nice weekender bag.\n\nContext:My gf(27) lives 45 minutes away in LA traffic and she makes the trip every Friday night to stay with me in my humble studio apartment for the weekend. I've affectionately started calling her Bag Lady because she brings her work laptop bag, a duffel bag with clothes, a tote bag with her phone/waterbottle/book, her personal laptop bag for her fiction writing, and a tiny telfar purse for going out. Thats like 5 bags to pack just for Friday night to Monday morning every week and she has to walk up a long hill to get to my apartment from the car.\n\nHer duffel bag is old and falling apart so it would be nice to get her something stylish and practical to bring for the weekend that she could also repurpose for travel in the future if we move in together. \n\n**My budget is ~ $200-$250** \n\nHere's a few I've been looking at but I'm open to suggestions:\n\n1. [LO &amp; SONS Catalina Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/products/catalina-deluxe-organic-canvas-dove-grey)\n -its big and budget friendly but not very stylish\n\n2. [Nomad Lane Bento Bag](https://nomadlane.com/products/the-bento-bag)\n -very practical but it might be too professional for our usual Netflix&amp;chill type weekend in bed + over budget\n\n3. [AWAY Large Everywhere Bag](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/large-everywhere-bag?color=coast_nylon)\n- bonus points for a fun color,  leather straps and free customization but also the heaviest = least practical \n\n4. [Stella Mccartney for Adidas Nylon Travel Bag](https://www.therealreal.com/products/women/handbags/luggage-and-travel/stella-mccartney-for-adidas-nylon-duffle-bag-hu6b7)\n-she showed me this one many months ago I think  just because she liked the blueish green color but it's sold and I have PTSD from buying her pre-owned gifts from therealreal before that arrived in poor condition :/\n\nThanks!",

It looks smaller in some of the photos, but supposedly it is 20L like the Away bag. Also says it has a laptop sleeve, the luggage sleeve, pocket for water bottle, shoulder strap, and an internal zip pocket. Nylon, good reviews, might be worth a look!\n\nThere's also [this one by Baggallini](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B13BWSFW/?coliid=I13QWKJW4GCHIP&amp;colid=2BYU8SK8B3JKX&amp;ref_=list_c_wl_lv_ov_lig_dp_it&amp;th=1), which is a little bit more ($50-60 depending on color). But it's a brand I've heard of, and it has similar features. \n\nWhile neither of these options are dupes for the Away bag, they are definitely budget-friendly options. :)",

        "selftext": "Hello all! Long time lurker. Got home last week from a 10 day trip to Paris and Rome that was 50/50 personal and business and I'm pleased to say, thanks to this group, I successfully managed to carry on only despite needing 2 completely different sets of clothing and work gear (laptop, mouse, dressier clothing). I used an older Briggs &amp; Riley expandable cabin bag as a personal item and a small Travelpro rolling bag for the overhead bin. For my next trip, which will hopefully be either strictly personal or strictly business so that I can carry much less in terms of clothing, I want to up my game and truly one-bag it as my Travelpro roller was ultimately gatechecked by Air France. \n\nMy requirements are that it must be personal item sized and fit under the seat (so less than \\~17\" tall). I like backpacks with a hidden passport pocket, trolley sleeve, and dedicated laptop area. Bonus points for external water bottle pocket. \n\nThe options I'm debating between are the following:\n\n**Calpak Luka:**\n\n[https://www.calpaktravel.com/products/luka-laptop-backpack/matte-black](https://www.calpaktravel.com/products/luka-laptop-backpack/matte-black) (love it, good price point, has water bottle pocket, but concerned about longevity...then again, it's a decent price point for Black Friday)\n\n**SwissGear Travel backpack:**\n\n[https://www.swissgear.com/backpacks/travel-friendly-backpacks/swissgear-5625-getaway-weekend-backpack-heather-gray](https://www.swissgear.com/backpacks/travel-friendly-backpacks/swissgear-5625-getaway-weekend-backpack-heather-gray) (love the clamshell opening, but it's on the bigger side and I don't love it aesthetically)\n\n**Nordace Siena:**\n\n[https://nordace.com/en/product/nordace-siena-smart-backpack/](https://nordace.com/en/product/nordace-siena-smart-backpack/) (I like the looks and the layout, but I'm worried about longevity as I've never heard of this brand and also I don't like the non-removable charging port. These were banned from all the flights I took last week)\n\n**Away backpack:**\n\n[https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/front-pocket-backpack?color=black\\_nylon&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAj4ecBhD3ARIsAM4Q\\_jEZotgULbUSRVYnm58ODcXZcp\\_VlLxqyn8scnXIDESQ-JzD6CSpttUaAo\\_OEALw\\_wcB](https://www.awaytravel.com/travel-bags/front-pocket-backpack?color=black_nylon&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAj4ecBhD3ARIsAM4Q_jEZotgULbUSRVYnm58ODcXZcp_VlLxqyn8scnXIDESQ-JzD6CSpttUaAo_OEALw_wcB) (I like it aesthetically-- seeing someone else's at the airport is what drew me to it--but it's pretty expensive and it seems like it potentially has a lot of wasted space?). \n\nI have trouble visualizing how I'll like things until I actually use them, so I've already spent lots on various backpacks and duffles (Maven Thread backpack, Nomad Lane Bento Bag, Briggs &amp; Riley Cabin Bag, to name a few) trying to find what works best for me so I appreciate any recs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for any advice!",
