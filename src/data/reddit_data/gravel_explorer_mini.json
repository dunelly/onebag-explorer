The contents of these bags vary slightly depending on trip type, but this has been my standard for the last few years. \n\nI will note that I am picky about my hair and keep it clean and parted. Over the years I have found it best to keep all my hair products (beard trimmer, razor, combs, pomade) in a separate case, which is not pictured. \n\n[Gravel Explorer Plus](https://www.graveltravel.com/products/the-explorer-plus-the-best-toiletry-bag-for-traveling): frequently used on trips greater than 1 week in length. \n- Shampoo, Conditioner, Body Wash (x2)\n- Face Wash &amp; Face Moisturizer\n- Pimple Patches\n- Gold Bond, Dinosaur Band Aids, Q-Tips\n- Toothbrush &amp; Toothpaste\n- Deodorant &amp; Chapstick \n\n[Gravel Explorer Mini](https://www.graveltravel.com/products/explorer-mini): primarily used for minimal weekend trips. \n- Shampoo &amp; Body Wash\n- Toothbrush &amp; Toothpaste\n- Deodorant &amp; Chapstick \n\nI’ve been really happy with quality and the thoughtfulness of these bags. The compartments are designed well and they compacts nicely when they’re not full. They’re also water resistant and have hooks for camping. They’re the best toiletry bags!\n\nIt’s such a weird thing to be excited/happy about, but it was a game changer when I switched from those generic leather bags with the one big compartment.",

        "selftext": "Honest non-technical review and comparison of Ozark Trail D2 folder \n\nPicked two of these up while traveling for work simply for comparison purposes. Just an average knife enthusiast here, so no bending, breaking, or cutting tests. I often see these compared to the Bugout and Bel-air, so I took some pics of mine all together and will reference them at times. \n\nFirst impressions: The scales are awful. Cheap plastic that feels every bit of that and are slick in the hand. The pocket clip is both great and awful at the same time. While it’s the perfect depth for my preference, it’s too large and way too strong. Takes a lot of force to manipulate it. It is also at an angle and I detest that. The most odd part of the knife is the cross bar lock. Mine has to be pulled down all the way to close the knife. This isn’t a big deal, but when comparing to others from Benchmade, Kershaw (Bel-air, Iridium), and Vosteed the muscle memory just isn’t there. For example, on my Bugout and Bel-air, the knife can be easily opened and closed with the cross bar lock pulled back about 2/3 of the way. On the Ozark Trail, I have to bury it all the way to the back. It is awkward, but admittedly, that’s due to my muscle memory. Fit and finish is definitely acceptable for a $10 knife. Is it perfect? Absolutely not! Would I be let down if I paid $50 or more for this, absolutely! But, it was $10, so a pass here. Blade came very sharp out of the box. No complaints there. There is both horizontal and vertical blade play when deployed. Not enough to impact normal daily use, but it is there. I haven’t tightened the pivot at all, but I assume doing so would become as issue for the otherwise smooth action. Blade is also noticeably off center. \n\nFor someone like me, this knife is at best a budget beater or gift item. Mine will likely go to my teenage boys. Sure it’s $10 and I can buy 18 of these for each Bugout or 15 for each Bel-air. But that isn’t for me. I would also venture to guess that the vast majority of people that love this knife also don’t apply that same economic logic to other personal purchases such as their vehicles and homes. \n\nI will save picking apart each aspect of this knife and going into details on how the blade, locking mechanism, scales, action, pocket clip, etc. is better on both the Bugout and Bel-air. Spoiler alert, they are and it isn’t close. But, frankly it should be. They are substantially more expensive and QC is a high priority with Benchmade and Kershaw. \n\nIMO, this knife is exactly what the price tag suggests. A very cheap knife made of cheap materials with acceptable blade steel. This knife has no place in my collection, it’s simply out of place and lost. I’m not a quantity over quality kind of person. I don’t lose knives and have no real reason for a cheap beater with questionable long term reliability. While it may sound strange to some, using this knife regularly will also have a detrimental impact on my muscle memory with my favorite knives. So that is a big turn off personally. \n\nIt looks cheap. It feels cheap. It is exactly what the $9.99 price tag suggests. \n\nFor context, my knife collection consists of $20-$250 knives. Vosteed, Civivi, Kershaw, Benchmade, Swiss, Opinel, Bradford, and more. I keep a Guardian 3 and Opinel in my work pack. My most often carried EDC folders are a Benchmade 940, Benchmade Bugout, Kershaw Bel-air, Kershaw Launch 18, Kershaw Iridium, Vosteed Raccoon cub, Civivi Baby Banter, etc. \n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder and we are all different. That’s what makes this hobby great. Keep em sharp and hope everyone has a wonderful day. ",

I have 2 of the newest versions waiting to be tested out, which already look like one color has the same QC issues for everyone that bought them, the other color seems to be fine. Really sucks about the QC, it ruins an otherwise great cheap knife having to say \"Yeah, but if you get one WITHOUT the QC issues\".",

        "selftext": "Honest non-technical review and comparison of Ozark Trail D2 folder \n\nPicked two of these up while traveling for work simply for comparison purposes. Just an average knife enthusiast here, so no bending, breaking, or cutting tests. I often see these compared to the Bugout and Bel-air, so I took some pics of mine all together and will reference them at times. \n\nFirst impressions: The scales are awful. Cheap plastic that feels every bit of that and are slick in the hand. The pocket clip is both great and awful at the same time. While it’s the perfect depth for my preference, it’s too large and way too strong. Takes a lot of force to manipulate it. It is also at an angle and I detest that. The most odd part of the knife is the cross bar lock. Mine has to be pulled down all the way to close the knife. This isn’t a big deal, but when comparing to others from Benchmade, Kershaw (Bel-air, Iridium), and Vosteed the muscle memory just isn’t there. For example, on my Bugout and Bel-air, the knife can be easily opened and closed with the cross bar lock pulled back about 2/3 of the way. On the Ozark Trail, I have to bury it all the way to the back. It is awkward, but admittedly, that’s due to my muscle memory. Fit and finish is definitely acceptable for a $10 knife. Is it perfect? Absolutely not! Would I be let down if I paid $50 or more for this, absolutely! But, it was $10, so a pass here. Blade came very sharp out of the box. No complaints there. There is both horizontal and vertical blade play when deployed. Not enough to impact normal daily use, but it is there. I haven’t tightened the pivot at all, but I assume doing so would become as issue for the otherwise smooth action. Blade is also noticeably off center. \n\nFor someone like me, this knife is at best a budget beater or gift item. Mine will likely go to my teenage boys. Sure it’s $10 and I can buy 18 of these for each Bugout or 15 for each Bel-air. But that isn’t for me. I would also venture to guess that the vast majority of people that love this knife also don’t apply that same economic logic to other personal purchases such as their vehicles and homes. \n\nI will save picking apart each aspect of this knife and going into details on how the blade, locking mechanism, scales, action, pocket clip, etc. is better on both the Bugout and Bel-air. Spoiler alert, they are and it isn’t close. But, frankly it should be. They are substantially more expensive and QC is a high priority with Benchmade and Kershaw. \n\nIMO, this knife is exactly what the price tag suggests. A very cheap knife made of cheap materials with acceptable blade steel. This knife has no place in my collection, it’s simply out of place and lost. I’m not a quantity over quality kind of person. I don’t lose knives and have no real reason for a cheap beater with questionable long term reliability. While it may sound strange to some, using this knife regularly will also have a detrimental impact on my muscle memory with my favorite knives. So that is a big turn off personally. \n\nIt looks cheap. It feels cheap. It is exactly what the $9.99 price tag suggests. \n\nFor context, my knife collection consists of $20-$250 knives. Vosteed, Civivi, Kershaw, Benchmade, Swiss, Opinel, Bradford, and more. I keep a Guardian 3 and Opinel in my work pack. My most often carried EDC folders are a Benchmade 940, Benchmade Bugout, Kershaw Bel-air, Kershaw Launch 18, Kershaw Iridium, Vosteed Raccoon cub, Civivi Baby Banter, etc. \n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder and we are all different. That’s what makes this hobby great. Keep em sharp and hope everyone has a wonderful day. ",

Blade is also noticeably off center. \n\nFor someone like me, this knife is at best a budget beater or gift item. Mine will likely go to my teenage boys. Sure it’s $10 and I can buy 18 of these for each Bugout or 15 for each Bel-air. But that isn’t for me. I would also venture to guess that the vast majority of people that love this knife also don’t apply that same economic logic to other personal purchases such as their vehicles and homes. \n\nI will save picking apart each aspect of this knife and going into details on how the blade, locking mechanism, scales, action, pocket clip, etc. is better on both the Bugout and Bel-air. Spoiler alert, they are and it isn’t close. But, frankly it should be. They are substantially more expensive and QC is a high priority with Benchmade and Kershaw. \n\nIMO, this knife is exactly what the price tag suggests. A very cheap knife made of cheap materials with acceptable blade steel. This knife has no place in my collection, it’s simply out of place and lost. I’m not a quantity over quality kind of person. I don’t lose knives and have no real reason for a cheap beater with questionable long term reliability. While it may sound strange to some, using this knife regularly will also have a detrimental impact on my muscle memory with my favorite knives. So that is a big turn off personally. \n\nIt looks cheap. It feels cheap. It is exactly what the $9.99 price tag suggests. \n\nFor context, my knife collection consists of $20-$250 knives. Vosteed, Civivi, Kershaw, Benchmade, Swiss, Opinel, Bradford, and more. I keep a Guardian 3 and Opinel in my work pack. My most often carried EDC folders are a Benchmade 940, Benchmade Bugout, Kershaw Bel-air, Kershaw Launch 18, Kershaw Iridium, Vosteed Raccoon cub, Civivi Baby Banter, etc. \n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder and we are all different. That’s what makes this hobby great. Keep em sharp and hope everyone has a wonderful day. ",

The QC really hurt this one pretty bad. 2 of my 3 examples are devoid of any QC issues and fantastic. 1 of the 3 is not centered and the way the blade is ground makes it look warped when it isn't. Those were literally some of the first ones sold before they broke the internet. Subsequent runs seem to have worse QC, part fitment, and issues with edges being burned. I have 2 of the newest versions waiting to be tested out, which already look like one color has the same QC issues for everyone that bought them, the other color seems to be fine. Really sucks about the QC, it ruins an otherwise great cheap knife having to say \"Yeah, but if you get one WITHOUT the QC issues\".",

Mine on the other hand, came sharper than 2 civivi knives and another I got. And is still sharp. \nAs you said the scales are just awful. And even though the mechanics on it are chinchy, I find myself flicking it open and closed for a while. It has an interesting spring to it. I only have a handful of knives so I’m by far no expert, but for $10 it’s a steal. Especially since you can’t get a $10 food combo anywhere anymore. \n\nI think if you had this in your truck and some real crap went down and you had this knife, you could make some stuff work to at least survive. Barring the situation would have to be horrendous 🤣🤣",

The Slim did however slip into any of the pockets of my tp2.\n\nAlso, the materials are wonderful. Feels sturdy and is very water resistant. Best of all, cleans very easily under running water and some dish soap. Photos don’t do the material justice. It looks and feels much nicer in hand!\n\nMy only issue was the aquaguard zipper that didnt quite close to the very end. I had a little water and dampness still inside from a hastily packed rush to the airport, and for better or worse, the water had collected inside the very water resistant material and seeped thru that small gap. Not a big deal cause you can force it to be a tighter close but something to note.\n\nI did try the peak design wash pouch small, the aforementioned explorer slim, as well as my then current matador flat toiletries kit.\n\nWill do a comp. But sufficed to say, the mini won me over with its roominess, compact shape, and solid materials.",

            "body": "**INTRO**\n\nI had been searching for something smaller to replace my Aer Dopp Kit 2. Its a terrific piece of kit, but its size makes me want to carry more than I need. and packed into my bag, it takes up a considerable portion of space. So, went on a holiday sale tear and took a look at several dopp kits of various shapes and sizes.\n\n**Review Criteria:**\n\n* smaller, flatter shape: wanna be able to pack it easily into my Aer Travel Pack 2, namely the front pocket to keep it away from anything else in case of spillage.\n* design: if i'm paying more for a ziplock bag, i'd want some thoughtful materials and org\n* easy to clean: i'm a messy person, but love a clean bag\n* accessibility: how easy is it to get to my ish\n* fun factor: as a manybagger, that's why we here!\n\n1-5 pts each criteria for a possible total of 25 pts.\n\n**Toiletries:**\n\n1. matador soap case (hair/body bar)\n2. matador flatpak (face wash)\n3. matador flatpak (hair conditioner)\n4. quip floss kit\n5. humangear stax (face lotion)\n6. humangear stax (clay pomade)\n7. tooth brush\n8. mini toothpaste\n9. 7” comb\n10. mini deodorant\n\nI'll go in the order I received and tried them. Mind you, I've only traveled a few times since with one or two of them, so not alot of time with them, but I did try to \"live\" out of them for a few days in my bathroom to get a feel.\n\nI actually ended up with a surprising pic!\n\n**Peak Designs Wash Pouch Small**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 1\n* design: 4\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 4\n\nTotal: 15 pts\n\nI wanted to really like this pouch. First glance, its a gorgeous little dopp kit. Best looking of the bunch by a long shot with its sage green outer shell and herringbone like interior liner.\n\nAnd it was markedly smaller than the aer. Really loved the materials and funky shape. super unique and fun to use. lots of pockets, and loved how i could clean it so easily with the pull out tabs. and most of all, i liked the smaller footprint on my counter. the metal hook is a terrific touch.\n\nbut the materials really stood out to me. wonderful handfeel! made me want a larger backpack! was definitely the fanciest and nicest bag of the bunch.\n\nunfortunately, while the shape was fun to hold and look at, it was kinda awkward to use. the criss cross pockets looked cool, and i liked how it held the bag together while open. but each pocket didnt really feel as useful: smaller ones too small, big ones not big enough? and maybe it needed breaking in, but it wouldnt quite open as i'd like, nor sit on the counter stable.\n\nbut the real kicker was the odd shape, which made it pack not much better than my dopp 2. sure, its smaller, but when fully loaded, the bulgy odd triangular tube shape took up room in my bag in such a way that it didnt let the other items in my bag sit together as neatly. and did NOT pass front pocket test. i could wedge it in there, but it was pretty ugly.\n\n**Matador Flatpak Case (The non-zippered one.)**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 5\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 19 pts\n\nI purchased this after really loving their smaller flatpaks that i regularly use for travel. When i got it, was surprised at how big it was. and yet, given that its a rolltop, it can scrunch down pretty small.\n\nEasily fit all my tolietries, but not only that the big open top made it really easy to get to everything. and the material allowed light to shine thru, so i could see everything quickly and easily. Its just a big ol' bag made of super high tech materials.\n\nbest of all, i got this due to the dry-through tech. I travel with a scrub towel, and love how the membrane was able to dry thru it!\n\nThe flatter design was great too for packing into my bag no matter how much i dumped into it. and its the lightest weight of the bunch.\n\nbut after a while, the detailed organizer in me would have liked some pockets to keep things nicely separated. and would have been nice to separate the wash cloth from other items and not gunk up the other items while it dried inside.\n\nalso, while it takes up little space on a tight sink, and stands up ok, it does tend to slump over when full. i had stuff spill out all over my bathroom floor a few times using it. and i do like the loop, but a hook would have been much preferred.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Slim**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 5\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 17 pts\n\nAnother bag i really wanted to love. had a super flat shape. and loved all the pockets! so many cool places to put various things. and i liked the loop / hook design which made it really easy to hang.\n\nThe materials were MUCH nicer in hand. in pictures and videos, just looks like any other plastic'y nylon material. but in hand, feels much more luxe and soft and doesnt chaff. i really like it. and best of all, when packed, it fit super nicely in the front pocket of my aer travel pack 2.\n\nbut ultimately for me, each pocket was just a little too tight. and while the materials were easy to clean, the various tight pockets made it actually hard to clean. and due to the open face design, its made to be hanging from your towel rack. and it takes up alot of counterspace, especially when folded out.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Mini**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 4\n* accessibility: 3\n* fun factor: 5\n\nTotal: 20 pts\n\nI thought I was going to hate this little guy. Seems kinda fat, and its just two pockets. why bother? and yet, every review i read or heard kept on touting how great it was, so i reluctantly purchased it. but over time using it, i realized, this might be the one!\n\nAs like the explorer slim, love the materials. solid, robust, and luxe. in hand, just felt great and much better than expected.\n\nReally like the rubberized handles and zipper pulls, and the loop makes it easy to hang and place in any cramped space. Nevermind, helpful to pull from my pack. a rubber loop seems innocuous, but really made the bag fun to use.\n\nIts not much bigger than a large pencil case and sure, just two simple pockets. but that's all i really needed. fit all my toiletries with a packed but comfy fit. only once, did i have to do a full bag dump. the zippers open up rather wide to help you really dig into it.\n\noverall, as definitely smallest of the lot, it could fit anywhere in my travel pack without taking up too much space. the rectangular shape lent itself to any packing tetris, as it felt half the size of my old aer dopp kit 2. And it soft materials lends itself to a real smush if need be.\n\nbest of all, its only a touch thicker than the explorer slim, and whaddya know, fit the front pocket ok! if the main compartment is packed, it is pretty tight, but it can work.\n\nAnd since its just two pockets, made it really easy to clean and wash after the week's \"trip\".\n\nMy own issues are the black interior. would be nice to have something hi-vis ish. And if its really packed, accessibility does take a nose dive where i might do a complete bag dump. but that was rare.\n\nAlso, due to the rounded edges, the big pocket zipper sometimes doesnt quite close all the way, and there's a small gap. but i just have to tug just a bit more to get it closed right.\n\nBut for $39 (was actually $29 with some helpful discount codes during the holidays), cant complain too much.\n\nI feel like i went on waaaay too much on a bag that only has 2 pockets, but other than that, this is my new travel dopp kit!\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe gravel explorer line really impressed me. on paper, and in pictures, have to admit, not so impressive. but in hand, wow, totally different experience.\n\nbut the mini is the truth. easy to use, packs great, materials feel solid and terrific. what more do i need?\n\nwell, maybe the matador, as i could totally see myself using it as well, not only standalone, but also as an addition to the explorer mini to hold my shower scrub towel, since it packs so flat and small.\n\nas for the peak designs wash pouch small, just a wonderful little thing to behold. just wish its unique oddness worked for me. heck, i just may get the larger one for those long tours, where i'll need everything in my bathroom cabinet. the materials are wonderful, and the design is top notch. on those longer trips, normally, i take a roller, and i'm sure i can find room for it.\n\nCongrats to you for making it to the end!",

Mind you, I've only traveled a few times since with one or two of them, so not alot of time with them, but I did try to \"live\" out of them for a few days in my bathroom to get a feel.\n\nI actually ended up with a surprising pic!\n\n**Peak Designs Wash Pouch Small**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 1\n* design: 4\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 4\n\nTotal: 15 pts\n\nI wanted to really like this pouch. First glance, its a gorgeous little dopp kit. Best looking of the bunch by a long shot with its sage green outer shell and herringbone like interior liner.\n\nAnd it was markedly smaller than the aer. Really loved the materials and funky shape. super unique and fun to use. lots of pockets, and loved how i could clean it so easily with the pull out tabs. and most of all, i liked the smaller footprint on my counter. the metal hook is a terrific touch.\n\nbut the materials really stood out to me. wonderful handfeel! made me want a larger backpack! was definitely the fanciest and nicest bag of the bunch.\n\nunfortunately, while the shape was fun to hold and look at, it was kinda awkward to use. the criss cross pockets looked cool, and i liked how it held the bag together while open. but each pocket didnt really feel as useful: smaller ones too small, big ones not big enough? and maybe it needed breaking in, but it wouldnt quite open as i'd like, nor sit on the counter stable.\n\nbut the real kicker was the odd shape, which made it pack not much better than my dopp 2. sure, its smaller, but when fully loaded, the bulgy odd triangular tube shape took up room in my bag in such a way that it didnt let the other items in my bag sit together as neatly. and did NOT pass front pocket test. i could wedge it in there, but it was pretty ugly.\n\n**Matador Flatpak Case (The non-zippered one.)**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 5\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 19 pts\n\nI purchased this after really loving their smaller flatpaks that i regularly use for travel. When i got it, was surprised at how big it was. and yet, given that its a rolltop, it can scrunch down pretty small.\n\nEasily fit all my tolietries, but not only that the big open top made it really easy to get to everything. and the material allowed light to shine thru, so i could see everything quickly and easily. Its just a big ol' bag made of super high tech materials.\n\nbest of all, i got this due to the dry-through tech. I travel with a scrub towel, and love how the membrane was able to dry thru it!\n\nThe flatter design was great too for packing into my bag no matter how much i dumped into it. and its the lightest weight of the bunch.\n\nbut after a while, the detailed organizer in me would have liked some pockets to keep things nicely separated. and would have been nice to separate the wash cloth from other items and not gunk up the other items while it dried inside.\n\nalso, while it takes up little space on a tight sink, and stands up ok, it does tend to slump over when full. i had stuff spill out all over my bathroom floor a few times using it. and i do like the loop, but a hook would have been much preferred.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Slim**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 5\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 17 pts\n\nAnother bag i really wanted to love. had a super flat shape. and loved all the pockets! so many cool places to put various things. and i liked the loop / hook design which made it really easy to hang.\n\nThe materials were MUCH nicer in hand. in pictures and videos, just looks like any other plastic'y nylon material. but in hand, feels much more luxe and soft and doesnt chaff. i really like it. and best of all, when packed, it fit super nicely in the front pocket of my aer travel pack 2.\n\nbut ultimately for me, each pocket was just a little too tight. and while the materials were easy to clean, the various tight pockets made it actually hard to clean. and due to the open face design, its made to be hanging from your towel rack. and it takes up alot of counterspace, especially when folded out.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Mini**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 4\n* accessibility: 3\n* fun factor: 5\n\nTotal: 20 pts\n\nI thought I was going to hate this little guy. Seems kinda fat, and its just two pockets. why bother? and yet, every review i read or heard kept on touting how great it was, so i reluctantly purchased it. but over time using it, i realized, this might be the one!\n\nAs like the explorer slim, love the materials. solid, robust, and luxe. in hand, just felt great and much better than expected.\n\nReally like the rubberized handles and zipper pulls, and the loop makes it easy to hang and place in any cramped space. Nevermind, helpful to pull from my pack. a rubber loop seems innocuous, but really made the bag fun to use.\n\nIts not much bigger than a large pencil case and sure, just two simple pockets. but that's all i really needed. fit all my toiletries with a packed but comfy fit. only once, did i have to do a full bag dump. the zippers open up rather wide to help you really dig into it.\n\noverall, as definitely smallest of the lot, it could fit anywhere in my travel pack without taking up too much space. the rectangular shape lent itself to any packing tetris, as it felt half the size of my old aer dopp kit 2. And it soft materials lends itself to a real smush if need be.\n\nbest of all, its only a touch thicker than the explorer slim, and whaddya know, fit the front pocket ok! if the main compartment is packed, it is pretty tight, but it can work.\n\nAnd since its just two pockets, made it really easy to clean and wash after the week's \"trip\".\n\nMy own issues are the black interior. would be nice to have something hi-vis ish. And if its really packed, accessibility does take a nose dive where i might do a complete bag dump. but that was rare.\n\nAlso, due to the rounded edges, the big pocket zipper sometimes doesnt quite close all the way, and there's a small gap. but i just have to tug just a bit more to get it closed right.\n\nBut for $39 (was actually $29 with some helpful discount codes during the holidays), cant complain too much.\n\nI feel like i went on waaaay too much on a bag that only has 2 pockets, but other than that, this is my new travel dopp kit!\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe gravel explorer line really impressed me. on paper, and in pictures, have to admit, not so impressive. but in hand, wow, totally different experience.\n\nbut the mini is the truth. easy to use, packs great, materials feel solid and terrific. what more do i need?\n\nwell, maybe the matador, as i could totally see myself using it as well, not only standalone, but also as an addition to the explorer mini to hold my shower scrub towel, since it packs so flat and small.\n\nas for the peak designs wash pouch small, just a wonderful little thing to behold. just wish its unique oddness worked for me. heck, i just may get the larger one for those long tours, where i'll need everything in my bathroom cabinet. the materials are wonderful, and the design is top notch. on those longer trips, normally, i take a roller, and i'm sure i can find room for it.\n\nCongrats to you for making it to the end!",

            "body": "**INTRO**\n\nI had been searching for something smaller to replace my Aer Dopp Kit 2. Its a terrific piece of kit, but its size makes me want to carry more than I need. and packed into my bag, it takes up a considerable portion of space. So, went on a holiday sale tear and took a look at several dopp kits of various shapes and sizes.\n\n**Review Criteria:**\n\n* smaller, flatter shape: wanna be able to pack it easily into my Aer Travel Pack 2, namely the front pocket to keep it away from anything else in case of spillage.\n* design: if i'm paying more for a ziplock bag, i'd want some thoughtful materials and org\n* easy to clean: i'm a messy person, but love a clean bag\n* accessibility: how easy is it to get to my ish\n* fun factor: as a manybagger, that's why we here!\n\n1-5 pts each criteria for a possible total of 25 pts.\n\n**Toiletries:**\n\n1. matador soap case (hair/body bar)\n2. matador flatpak (face wash)\n3. matador flatpak (hair conditioner)\n4. quip floss kit\n5. humangear stax (face lotion)\n6. humangear stax (clay pomade)\n7. tooth brush\n8. mini toothpaste\n9. 7” comb\n10. mini deodorant\n\nI'll go in the order I received and tried them. Mind you, I've only traveled a few times since with one or two of them, so not alot of time with them, but I did try to \"live\" out of them for a few days in my bathroom to get a feel.\n\nI actually ended up with a surprising pic!\n\n**Peak Designs Wash Pouch Small**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 1\n* design: 4\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 4\n\nTotal: 15 pts\n\nI wanted to really like this pouch. First glance, its a gorgeous little dopp kit. Best looking of the bunch by a long shot with its sage green outer shell and herringbone like interior liner.\n\nAnd it was markedly smaller than the aer. Really loved the materials and funky shape. super unique and fun to use. lots of pockets, and loved how i could clean it so easily with the pull out tabs. and most of all, i liked the smaller footprint on my counter. the metal hook is a terrific touch.\n\nbut the materials really stood out to me. wonderful handfeel! made me want a larger backpack! was definitely the fanciest and nicest bag of the bunch.\n\nunfortunately, while the shape was fun to hold and look at, it was kinda awkward to use. the criss cross pockets looked cool, and i liked how it held the bag together while open. but each pocket didnt really feel as useful: smaller ones too small, big ones not big enough? and maybe it needed breaking in, but it wouldnt quite open as i'd like, nor sit on the counter stable.\n\nbut the real kicker was the odd shape, which made it pack not much better than my dopp 2. sure, its smaller, but when fully loaded, the bulgy odd triangular tube shape took up room in my bag in such a way that it didnt let the other items in my bag sit together as neatly. and did NOT pass front pocket test. i could wedge it in there, but it was pretty ugly.\n\n**Matador Flatpak Case (The non-zippered one.)**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 5\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 19 pts\n\nI purchased this after really loving their smaller flatpaks that i regularly use for travel. When i got it, was surprised at how big it was. and yet, given that its a rolltop, it can scrunch down pretty small.\n\nEasily fit all my tolietries, but not only that the big open top made it really easy to get to everything. and the material allowed light to shine thru, so i could see everything quickly and easily. Its just a big ol' bag made of super high tech materials.\n\nbest of all, i got this due to the dry-through tech. I travel with a scrub towel, and love how the membrane was able to dry thru it!\n\nThe flatter design was great too for packing into my bag no matter how much i dumped into it. and its the lightest weight of the bunch.\n\nbut after a while, the detailed organizer in me would have liked some pockets to keep things nicely separated. and would have been nice to separate the wash cloth from other items and not gunk up the other items while it dried inside.\n\nalso, while it takes up little space on a tight sink, and stands up ok, it does tend to slump over when full. i had stuff spill out all over my bathroom floor a few times using it. and i do like the loop, but a hook would have been much preferred.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Slim**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 5\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 17 pts\n\nAnother bag i really wanted to love. had a super flat shape. and loved all the pockets! so many cool places to put various things. and i liked the loop / hook design which made it really easy to hang.\n\nThe materials were MUCH nicer in hand. in pictures and videos, just looks like any other plastic'y nylon material. but in hand, feels much more luxe and soft and doesnt chaff. i really like it. and best of all, when packed, it fit super nicely in the front pocket of my aer travel pack 2.\n\nbut ultimately for me, each pocket was just a little too tight. and while the materials were easy to clean, the various tight pockets made it actually hard to clean. and due to the open face design, its made to be hanging from your towel rack. and it takes up alot of counterspace, especially when folded out.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Mini**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 4\n* accessibility: 3\n* fun factor: 5\n\nTotal: 20 pts\n\nI thought I was going to hate this little guy. Seems kinda fat, and its just two pockets. why bother? and yet, every review i read or heard kept on touting how great it was, so i reluctantly purchased it. but over time using it, i realized, this might be the one!\n\nAs like the explorer slim, love the materials. solid, robust, and luxe. in hand, just felt great and much better than expected.\n\nReally like the rubberized handles and zipper pulls, and the loop makes it easy to hang and place in any cramped space. Nevermind, helpful to pull from my pack. a rubber loop seems innocuous, but really made the bag fun to use.\n\nIts not much bigger than a large pencil case and sure, just two simple pockets. but that's all i really needed. fit all my toiletries with a packed but comfy fit. only once, did i have to do a full bag dump. the zippers open up rather wide to help you really dig into it.\n\noverall, as definitely smallest of the lot, it could fit anywhere in my travel pack without taking up too much space. the rectangular shape lent itself to any packing tetris, as it felt half the size of my old aer dopp kit 2. And it soft materials lends itself to a real smush if need be.\n\nbest of all, its only a touch thicker than the explorer slim, and whaddya know, fit the front pocket ok! if the main compartment is packed, it is pretty tight, but it can work.\n\nAnd since its just two pockets, made it really easy to clean and wash after the week's \"trip\".\n\nMy own issues are the black interior. would be nice to have something hi-vis ish. And if its really packed, accessibility does take a nose dive where i might do a complete bag dump. but that was rare.\n\nAlso, due to the rounded edges, the big pocket zipper sometimes doesnt quite close all the way, and there's a small gap. but i just have to tug just a bit more to get it closed right.\n\nBut for $39 (was actually $29 with some helpful discount codes during the holidays), cant complain too much.\n\nI feel like i went on waaaay too much on a bag that only has 2 pockets, but other than that, this is my new travel dopp kit!\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe gravel explorer line really impressed me. on paper, and in pictures, have to admit, not so impressive. but in hand, wow, totally different experience.\n\nbut the mini is the truth. easy to use, packs great, materials feel solid and terrific. what more do i need?\n\nwell, maybe the matador, as i could totally see myself using it as well, not only standalone, but also as an addition to the explorer mini to hold my shower scrub towel, since it packs so flat and small.\n\nas for the peak designs wash pouch small, just a wonderful little thing to behold. just wish its unique oddness worked for me. heck, i just may get the larger one for those long tours, where i'll need everything in my bathroom cabinet. the materials are wonderful, and the design is top notch. on those longer trips, normally, i take a roller, and i'm sure i can find room for it.\n\nCongrats to you for making it to the end!",

        "selftext": "Saw this at Walmart by chance. I immediately purchased for my 14 year-old son. For $248, it can’t be beat for a beginner. I’ve owned and wrenched on many high end bikes ($3k+) over the years, and for the money, I don’t think I’ve seen a new bike with this much value.\n\nI immediately took it a part and rebuilt it, but it surprisingly wasn’t assembled all too bad by the contractor. Not your typical Walmart Bike!\n\n2x7 L-Twoo R2 STI shifters\nShimano Tourney derailleurs \nGeneric 3 piece crank\nMechanical Disc Brzkes\nKenda 40c tires - Tanwall\nAluminum Alloy frame w/internal routing\nGeneric Seat (actually pretty comfy IMO)\nDouble Walled Alloy Rims - QR not Thru Axle\nFrame has mounting for rack/fenders, cage under bottom bracket, and mounts on the fork.\n\nFits my son great he’s 5’8”. That being said, I’m 6’3” and have no clue why Walmart would advertise this fitting me.\n\nIt’s really a great bike for a beginner.\n\nHere are the items I’d improve:\n- bar tape is nice looking, but very thin. I’ll be adding something nicer for comfort\n- Rims are heavy…but hey, they are double walled and the bike was $248!\n- gearing is so/so. Fine for most rides, but could use more gearing for extended climbing\n- no seat tube water bottle mount, only 1 on the downtube. Why? Seems like a cheap addition to the frame to allow for a second bottle cage, and there is plenty of room for it.\n- rear wheel appears to be a freewheel, not a cassette, may be harder to upgrade.\n\nOk, even with those items, $248 is an amazing price point. While it can’t compare to my Domane Gen 4 or YT Szepter, it’s not meant to. I would not hesitate taking this out for 1-2 hour rides. Of course, I’m comfortable working on bikes and others who aren’t and/or don’t have access to a LBS willing to work on a department store bike may want to avoid.",

        "selftext": "Saw this at Walmart by chance. I immediately purchased for my 14 year-old son. For $248, it can’t be beat for a beginner. I’ve owned and wrenched on many high end bikes ($3k+) over the years, and for the money, I don’t think I’ve seen a new bike with this much value.\n\nI immediately took it a part and rebuilt it, but it surprisingly wasn’t assembled all too bad by the contractor. Not your typical Walmart Bike!\n\n2x7 L-Twoo R2 STI shifters\nShimano Tourney derailleurs \nGeneric 3 piece crank\nMechanical Disc Brzkes\nKenda 40c tires - Tanwall\nAluminum Alloy frame w/internal routing\nGeneric Seat (actually pretty comfy IMO)\nDouble Walled Alloy Rims - QR not Thru Axle\nFrame has mounting for rack/fenders, cage under bottom bracket, and mounts on the fork.\n\nFits my son great he’s 5’8”. That being said, I’m 6’3” and have no clue why Walmart would advertise this fitting me.\n\nIt’s really a great bike for a beginner.\n\nHere are the items I’d improve:\n- bar tape is nice looking, but very thin. I’ll be adding something nicer for comfort\n- Rims are heavy…but hey, they are double walled and the bike was $248!\n- gearing is so/so. Fine for most rides, but could use more gearing for extended climbing\n- no seat tube water bottle mount, only 1 on the downtube. Why? Seems like a cheap addition to the frame to allow for a second bottle cage, and there is plenty of room for it.\n- rear wheel appears to be a freewheel, not a cassette, may be harder to upgrade.\n\nOk, even with those items, $248 is an amazing price point. While it can’t compare to my Domane Gen 4 or YT Szepter, it’s not meant to. I would not hesitate taking this out for 1-2 hour rides. Of course, I’m comfortable working on bikes and others who aren’t and/or don’t have access to a LBS willing to work on a department store bike may want to avoid.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/kxnr92/i_bought_an_4500_mini_electric_tractor_off_of/",
        "selftext": "(Cross posted to /r/alibaba)\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI finally received my mini electric loader, and I will say: The experience of buying a 1,900 pound piece of farm equipment from China was an interesting one. I’ll summarize my thoughts in two parts. First, a step-by-step breakdown of everything I had to do to buy it, and second, a review of the loader itself.\n\n(Apologies for the long post, but I think this could be useful to others.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdraraj5kfb61.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62a12b9bed164c436a424f099f01ac49b55973e0\n\n**BUYING THE LOADER**\n\nOnce I knew I was going to buy this large, heavy, relatively expensive item, I began the process by doing a crap-ton of research. This included reading dozens of blogposts about Alibaba and lurking in this very subreddit. I got up to speed on my shipping terminology, and even asked a few shipping companies about their services with regard to Alibaba.com.\n\nThe machine I wanted was listed about eight or nine times. However, it was always pretty much the same listing, same photos, same videos, but with different company names. Each time I inquired, the representatives almost invariably responded with the wrong information. They didn’t seem to read the Order Inquiry, or if they did, they were confused as to what I was looking for. I ended up getting pretty good at patiently describing the product I was interested in— repeating myself if necessary, and always asking for a quote for a *door-to-door shipment*.\n\nI received several quotes, all of which were within about \\~20% of one another. After about three days of back-and-forth with ten or so different representatives, I went with the one who offered the lowest quote. He was also the person who I felt communicated with the most speed and clarity. Many of the representatives I chatted with just disappeared, others never seemed to read what I typed. The guy I used was always on top of his game. Thanks buddy.\n\n(At this point I have to reiterate how bad most of these folks are at actually selling product— It’s almost as if you have to grab them by the virtual shoulders and start yelling.)\n\nOnce I agreed to the final price (about $3100 including delivery fees), we discussed customs fees. It was pretty clear that it was going to be about $500 additional (payable once the machine made it to US soil),\n\nAt this point I felt comfortable with making the transaction, so I agreed to sign on the dotted line. He sent me an invoice, which included an upfront cost and a final payment. The upfront cost was about 30% of the purchase price and was payable by credit card. This allowed him to prep the order for shipping. The final payment was the remaining balance, and I paid via wire transfer. My bank had some questions, but ultimately It was no big deal.\n\nThis initiated the process of, well, a whole bunch of waiting. The updates were few and far between. It took over two weeks before the order was finally marked as shipped. Once it was shipped, there were no tracking numbers or anything of the sort. One day (about 30 days after my payment) it just sort of materialized in an industrial park in Kent, Washington. I discovered this when I got an email from Vanguard Logistics about my delivery… which included invoice for $1300.\n\n$1300! What!?\n\nI still don’t really know why this ended up being so expensive— The invoice alluded to bond fees, documentation fees, origin charges… It didn’t seem that I had any room for negotiation at this point, so I just sucked it up and paid the bill.\n\nOnce the bill was paid, the machine was promptly sent to a warehouse near where I live in Medford, Oregon. Here it was to be prepared for its last-mile journey. I received an automated email from Estes asking to set up a delivery appointment, which I did.\n\nThis actually proved to be the most difficult step, as the pallets that the loader shipped with had broken. The boys at Estes couldn’t figure out how to unload it once it got to my house. So, in the warehouse it sat for four additional days, until they finally got the courage to send it out to me with the idea that we’d just roll it onto the lift gate. Yeah, not so easy. Long story short, we had to manhandle all 1900 pounds onto the lift gate, lower it, then manhandle it off.\n\nBut— Hell yeah! After nearly two months, the item I had paid for was finally here! I tipped the delivery driver well and sent him on his way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**USING THE LOADER**\n\nInitial impressions are, WOW, this this was cheaply built. It’s thin sheet metal covered with a tiny layer of lime green paint. But the chassis itself seems solid. Plus it's electric, and unlike anything you could legally buy here in the USA.\n\nIt came absolutely plastered in giant Chinese stickers. Google translate informed me that they were warning against doing things like putting your hand underneath the boom, or charging the batteries without switching the power off. Pretty much exactly what you’d expect. And while they lend a cool cyberpunk look to the machine, but I think I’m going to take them off eventually.\n\nI had to fix a few things before I could get it moving. As I removed the sheet metal panels that cover the innards, I noticed that one of the heavy lead acid batteries had managed to dislodge completely. This tore out one of the wires used to connect them in series. I suspect the entire unit was dropped at one point during shipping, because I’m not sure how else that could have happened. I wasn’t able to re-crimp the broken connector, so I soldered it back together.\n\nSpeaking of batteries, these things are massive, unsealed, 12V, absolute units. The charger came in a separate box, and it is correspondingly huge. Of course, it’s wired for 220v, so I won’t be able to use it without a transformer. Bummer.\n\nIf I had it to do over again, I might request that they ship it without batteries. That way, I could just plug in my own batteries and rig up a charger based on the J1772 standard. That way, I could use a regular electric car charger.\n\nAnyway— at this point, I switched on the machine and was able to drive it around my driveway. Sweet! The accelerator pedal is insanely sensitive, and it's a challenge to drive it smoothly to say the least.\n\n~~Unfortunately, I haven't gotten the bucket to work yet-- it doesn't go up or down. I’m still not sure what the deal is, but I suspect that hydraulic fluid isn't making it to the cylinders. The hydraulic fluid reservoir was about halfway full when it arrived, but I have no idea how full it’s supposed to be. Once I get it working, I’ll update this post with my thoughts about the overall performance.~~\n\nEdit:  I got the hydraulics working!  I've been having a blast moving dirt, gravel, and wood chips around.  Here's a video of me learning how to use it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoLTmN8nvWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoLTmN8nvWs)\n\nUnsurprisingly, it feels a little underpowered.  You can really notice the power drop whenever you activate the hydraulics.  On the other hand, it's got enough oomph to move a full bucket of gravel, and is pretty spritely driving up a small hill with it.\n\nMy main complaint is how jerky the acceleration is, especially in forward gear.  You can see it in the video I linked.  There's a 'ca-chunk' whenever you try to inch it forward, which makes precision work a drag.  (It reminds me a bit of my BBSHD-based ebike, actually.  Maybe a firmware update could fix this?)\n\nI'll save the finer details for a future review, but I'll end with this:  My five-year-old self would be very pleased the performance.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIn conclusion, A+++ would buy again. But now that I know how the whole process works, I’d probably arrange to pick it up at the shipping hub myself with a utility trailer. Better yet, I might even try to pick it up at the port and sidestep the need for a freight forwarding company altogether.\n\nI’d also request that they ship it without batteries to save on weight and hopefully overall cost. Unfortunately, it can be hard to know what you’re getting, so it can be hard to ask for specific modifications without the benefit of hindsight.\n\nMy advice to others is to make sure you find a good representative, have tons of patience, and expect that your final bill will be higher than you were quoted. If you can do that, you can buy large items off of Alibaba.com.",
