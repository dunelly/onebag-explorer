        "selftext": "My main travel bag is the 40L Topo Designs Mountain Duffle. Iâ€™ve carried it on tons of flights both international and domestic. I like the simplicity and padded structure.\n\nPreviously, I did one trip with their Global Travel Bag and hated all the stupid pockets and extra material, it felt like it had tons of compartments but no space. I guess I just like a big open bag. I donâ€™t even really utilize the external side pockets on the Mountain Duffle, though I like the internal mesh pocket for this and that.\n\nBeen hitting a wall though with 40L on trips of around two weeks, particularly if I need to bring clothes for multiple activities/climates or need a second pair of shoes, like dress shoes or hiking boots. The bag is stuffed! \n\nI have a three week trip coming up and want something slightly bigger, but not so big that it precludes carry on. \n\nHereâ€™s what Iâ€™m looking at and what I like about them:\n\nPatagonia Black Hole 55L - It is what it is, seems like the perfect size but isnâ€™t particularly exciting. \n\nBlack Diamond Stonehauler 60L - Looks nice and I like the integrated bag for dirty laundry/shoes.\n\nThe North Face Base Camp Voyager 62L - I like the external pocket for shoes/laundry, but feels flimsy and the backpack straps in the lid seem weird. Worried it would be too big, but I bought one to check it out and itâ€™s not substantially bigger than my 40L Mountain Duffle. See pics. \n\n\n\n",

We got through the gate, but it was a smaller regional jet (still listed 22\" max) and the flight was packed. The overheads were completely stuffed throughout the plane and it took both of us to stuff it into the only spot left and get the door shut.\n\nThis was the first time she tried one bagging and she gets embarrassed easily. She used that bag a few more times, but I swear she left it 1/4 empty after that.\n\nAnecdotal, but anything over 22\" is definitely risky. I've seen people board with much larger bags, but I've seen people get force checked as well.\n\nCan you add a personal item backpack instead? You can get another 20-25L that way.",
