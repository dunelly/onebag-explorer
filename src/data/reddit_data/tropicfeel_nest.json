        "selftext": "After seeing the marketing for Tropicfeel I felt like I needed this bag however after seeing others reviews on the quality I couldn’t justify the price. I thankfully stumbled upon a second hand one on eBay and got it at 50% off the RRP. \n\nI’ve recently used it for a 4 day trip to Alicante so thought I’d give it a quick honest review. \n\nThe bag itself has extremely useful compartments. I used the bottom foldable compartment which can be accessed from the side for my snacks and electronics so they were easy to grab out when needed. The front expandable pocket (spider net) was great for sticking my liquids bag in at the airport for quick access at security, I then stuck them in the main compartment after. The option to expand the capacity is a big bonus for me. It allowed me to stash the additional items I’d worn on the plane into what would normally be a fully packed bag. However as you fold the pocket away when not in use it does look quite creased. \n\nThere is a little pocket on the back where I could store my passport, this gave me peace of mind when travelling on the metro etc that it wouldn’t be stolen easily. \n\nOverall the functionality of the bag was great. However the quality of the bag doesn’t match the RRP and I can see it starting to fray on some of the black elasticated hooks. \n\nThe shoulder straps were quite comfy and I had no issues carrying it around town/going on trips. However I do think the airflow could be improved on the back of the backpack. Aesthetically I like it, however I did have to buy a waterproof cover off Amazon to ensure it would stay dry if it started to rain. It claims to be weatherproof however anything in the ‘spider net’ expandable pocket on the front would get wet. I managed to fit the cover into the pocket at the bottom of the bag where the kangaroo pocket is stored. \n\nThe bag did fit into the Ryanair personal sizer when my water bottle was removed out of the side pocket so I managed to take it as my free bag. I would definitely use it again but wouldn’t recommend buying it at full price.",

I got their packing cube that is really compact. I really love the pocket at the bottom that you can take out or not use. I brought two pairs of shoes and the pair I wasn't wearing I either had in that pocket or when I was barefoot (like getting onto the boat), I clipped the other shoe on the bag. The one thing I would change is the waterbottle holder to be a bit bigger.\n\nIt held up really well and still looks brand new. I stuffed that thing and nothing ever broke or frayed. I got it for $200 and the packing cube was an additional $25? I believe. Well worth it! It'll last me years.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "I love packing my bag as efficiently as possible. So I did, for a potential upcoming trip to Denmark just to see if everything will fit together nicely. \n\nThe bag I'm using is the Tropicfeel Hive. It theoretically expands from 22L upon 46L they claim. I can tell you straight away that might not be fully true. However I tried out the 40L Forclaz backpack from Decathlon and surprisingly I could fit more inside my Hive than in the Forclaz one. Strange because the Hive is a 28L bag (when expansion zipper is expanded) only with a 10L packing cube attached to the outside. And yeah I'm using the 10L compression cube from their Nest backpack opposed to the 12L that comes with this Hive backpack. Why? It simply doesn't fit the 12L cube. \n\nI don't use particularly small clothes or clothes that take up less space. Just regular clothes.\n\nAnyway for this trip I've got:\n\n- 8x t-shirt\n- 1x sweatshirt\n- 1x hoodie \n- 2x long pants\n- 1x short pants for sports\n- 10x underwear\n- 7x socks\n- 1x big microfiber towel\n\nNext to that I've got some electronics in the grey tech kit. I've brought:\n\n- 2x 10.000 MaH powerbank\n- 2x Usb c cables\n- pasport\n- some other things like glasses.\n\nAnd of course I've got my toiletry which sits on the outside of this bag. Just your basic things like deodorant, perfume, shower gel, shaving stuff, toothpaste and toothpaste and some miscellaneous items.\n\nWhat do you think of this bag and how would you organize yours? I'm hoping to get some nice feedback on this or to help other members here make their backpack/packing decisions based on my current experience. \n\nWith this setup I can basically go on for weeks and longer if I wash the clothes and buy items like toothpaste and deodorant on the go. If going to a warmer country I could even pack my camera in here because you don't need the big hoodie or warm clothes. \n\nLastly I got another compartment, the so called Kangaroo pouch for bigger things like an extra pair of shoes. I don't use it now, but if I want to it'll expand the bag even more. \n\nThe best thing about this? When I get to the destination, I unpack the bag, zip the expansion zipper back up and I can use it as a 22L daypack. And trust me it really works! Only thing I'd realistically change about this bag is it's water bottle compartment (it's quite small) and it's harness system which is less comfortable than the 40L Decathlon bag. It's not terrible though.\n\n*TLDR; this is my experience and explaination of my Tropicfeel Hive backpack and preparing for an upcoming trip. I explain what I take and how this bag works for me.",

So I did, for a potential upcoming trip to Denmark just to see if everything will fit together nicely. \n\nThe bag I'm using is the Tropicfeel Hive. It theoretically expands from 22L upon 46L they claim. I can tell you straight away that might not be fully true. However I tried out the 40L Forclaz backpack from Decathlon and surprisingly I could fit more inside my Hive than in the Forclaz one. Strange because the Hive is a 28L bag (when expansion zipper is expanded) only with a 10L packing cube attached to the outside. And yeah I'm using the 10L compression cube from their Nest backpack opposed to the 12L that comes with this Hive backpack. Why? It simply doesn't fit the 12L cube. \n\nI don't use particularly small clothes or clothes that take up less space. Just regular clothes.\n\nAnyway for this trip I've got:\n\n- 8x t-shirt\n- 1x sweatshirt\n- 1x hoodie \n- 2x long pants\n- 1x short pants for sports\n- 10x underwear\n- 7x socks\n- 1x big microfiber towel\n\nNext to that I've got some electronics in the grey tech kit.

Just your basic things like deodorant, perfume, shower gel, shaving stuff, toothpaste and toothpaste and some miscellaneous items.\n\nWhat do you think of this bag and how would you organize yours? I'm hoping to get some nice feedback on this or to help other members here make their backpack/packing decisions based on my current experience. \n\nWith this setup I can basically go on for weeks and longer if I wash the clothes and buy items like toothpaste and deodorant on the go. If going to a warmer country I could even pack my camera in here because you don't need the big hoodie or warm clothes. \n\nLastly I got another compartment, the so called Kangaroo pouch for bigger things like an extra pair of shoes. I don't use it now, but if I want to it'll expand the bag even more. \n\nThe best thing about this? When I get to the destination, I unpack the bag, zip the expansion zipper back up and I can use it as a 22L daypack. And trust me it really works! Only thing I'd realistically change about this bag is it's water bottle compartment (it's quite small) and it's harness system which is less comfortable than the 40L Decathlon bag. It's not terrible though.\n\n*TLDR; this is my experience and explaination of my Tropicfeel Hive backpack and preparing for an upcoming trip. I explain what I take and how this bag works for me.",

I'm pretty convinced for the Tropicfeel Hive... but the problem of the bottle is a big problem with 35°C outdoor. I thought to put maybe an other bottle inside or one in the shoe space underneath. Seems you're traveling more than me ;-) so don't lough if I make a stupid question: there are different colors for the Hive but I have to make the next trip to different location in Brasil... you think black is falling less in someone eyes instead grey or beige? thank you again",

And yes a bottle in the kangaroo shoe compartment is a great option, only disadvantage is that the bag doesn't stand on its own anymore. \n\nSo yes I think black is less attractive to thieves :)\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask",

Maybe check poshmark or a second hand site for a bit of a discount (tho it’s usually not too much a price difference)",

This means when I need to I can fit a LOT in this pack and when I arrive at my destination I just zip it down when unpacked to make it as a day pack.\n\nIn this setup I kept it simple. Putting my camera cube below (heaviest so most comfortable at the bottom) which includes a fullframe mirrorless camera, a 24-105 lens and a drone with extra batteries and remote. \n\nAbove that I've got my 2 Amazon basic packing cubes which contain 4 t-shirts, 2 shorts, underwear, socks and swimming pants. Enough to last me at least a week without washing. \n\nOn top of the cubes I've got my Tropicfeel Fidlock toiletry which can be hung outside of the bag whenever I need more space. But for now, to keep it as clean as possible, I've kept it inside. \n\nLast up, I always carry my microfiber towel and a drybag for my backpack in the laptop compartment. This will give quick access and isn't in the way when not necessary. I got my travel charger with 2 USB-C ports and 1 USB port in the netting together with 2 USB-C cables. On the top compartment I've got sunglasses and some cash. A powerbank sits in one of the two nets behind all the packing cubes, on the back of the backpack.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with this simple setup and I'm curious what you think of it as well! What else could I do to travel better/more efficient? Let me know!\n\nTLDR; my setup to travel to Milan and nearby with only one backpack",

That explains why you think it's too loose. It's only meant for keeping the shoulder straps together which it does well.\n\nAnd yes I absolutely love that kangaroo pouch/shoe compartment. It's not in the way but very useful when you want too. Also the accesoires are indeed kinda nice!\n\nThanks for your write up :)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/15ep88k/tropicfeel_nest_review_i_hate_it/",
        "selftext": "Some facts about my situation:\n\n* I am female and in my late 20s, was *hoping* to use this as my one bag for city walks, hiking, festivals, camping, personal item on planes, etc.\n* Got this bag ten months ago\n* I have the Smart Packing Cube add-on\n* This was technically 230 USD, but as a Canadian the exchange put it at 300 CAD on my card, plus an additional 80 CAD at the door (duties and taxes), so 380 CAD\n\nThe reality of this bag is that I only use it for city walks, and even then, it's not ideal. I want to love this bag, but at this point I have tried, and I just don't get it. I regret the purchase.\n\n# This bag is the opposite of a bottomless pit\n\nSome bags have \"bottomless pit\" energy, where they hold a surprising amount of stuff, and it is a pleasant shock every single time. I have that relationship with my cheap [Amazon 30L Backpack](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07C1KXF2Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and my fanny pack. The Nest purports to also have a maximum capacity of 30L, so I thought that it would feel similarly to my cheaper bag, but more organized and comfortable. I find it fits *shockingly* little. The Nest has a \"range\" for carrying capacity — \"16 to 30 L\", and to get to the 30 L you are supposed to add the packing cube to the front pouch. If you don't need the packing cube but still want a 30L capacity, you have this very open and awkward front pouch with no zipper. I would rather have a large front section with a zipper — I really don't get why the spider net exists.\n\n# The spider net is too small for the packing cube\n\nThe spider net has no stretch; it feels like you're pulled on the material of a water-resistant jacket (i.e. not something you'd consider stretchy).\n\n If you fill the packing cube to its intended maximum (i.e. 2 socks, 2 underwear, 6 pieces in the elastics, and 1 bulkier item on the bottom), and you fill up the bag itself (without pushing its limits), the cube will arguably not fit. You have to PULL the spider net over with MUSCLE and it feels wrong/odd. It also looks weird. The cube's contents end up shifting towards the middle, making it bulge and look like you tried to stick a sphere on a rectangle. Remember, this is WITHOUT pushing any volume limits.\n\nIf you push the spacing maximum in any way you'll have an even harder time. You can't push this bag's limits in any way otherwise it will not close or work. There is no stretch anywhere — it's like a small cardboard box. \n\n# The bag is a rectangle, and doesn't sit flush against your back\n\nThis is perhaps an aesthetic critique that I could have foreseen, but the bag does not mould to the body at all — it's like a stiff rectangle and touches the pointiest parts of your back. It doesn't look flush or natural to me, it looks like a hard briefcase on your back. It weirdly makes me feel uncool/nerdy, like the opposite of outdoorsy/geary. I know that's cringe to say I'm sorry lol but it's how I feel. \n\n# The water bottle compartment is too small\n\nThis is a common complaint so I won't get too into it, but I will say that I purchased a smaller bottle for the sole purpose of having something to fit in that space. I bought [this water bottle](https://globalassets.starbucks.com/assets/1d91eff0482a4d5d8157a31f8bc6b9b2.jpg?impolicy=1by1_medium_630) from Starbucks, to fit the exact intended dimensions. It's like SKIN TIGHT and can't be put in casually without looking — I have to 2-hand it. This means if I reach for the bottle while walking, I have to ask a friend to put it back for me or take off my bag lol. Not exaggerating, maybe I am stupid, but idk I just think the design is super off. \n\n# The clamshell opening is not for me\n\nI see the benefit of it — it's a mini suitcase, sure. If you want to get something larger out of there, it will NOT be casual. Nothing more cursed than fully opening a clamshell bag at a coffee shop — I often try to open just the top part, but it's not meant to open like that — the \"top\" of the opening is still the FRONT of the bag, so you're never \"reaching into the bag from above\". If you try, the whole clam shell comes down. I end up using a lot of physical space in a coffee shop to get a book out of my bag. Furthermore, if you have the packing cube in the front, opening the clam shell is SO weird — the zippers are like curling inwards as the packing cube clings on for dear life.\n\n# The inner pockets are a lie \n\nThe bag's front wall is lined with inner pockets. It looks like a pocket paradise, but it is not. I had this sense that I could fill up the bag, and THEN have the pockets for extra stuff. But if you fill up the bag *and* the pockets, the pockets will bulge, and require room in the bag, which you don't have because you filled it. And since the bag has no stretch, it won't close. So the pockets provide no additional space, just additional options, if that makes sense. The same goes for the top pocket — the depth of that pocket takes up space in the main area. If you fill up the main area and then open the top pocket thinking you have room for sunglasses, you will open the pocket to see a FLAT space with no depth. It's like opening a door to a wall.\n\n# The suitcase-handle holder is cursed\n\nThe back of the bag has a slip for you to put the bag over your carry-on's handlebar. If the bag is full (not bursting, but full) with a laptop in the back, then it's a TIGHT squeeze to get a standard handle through the slip. It feels like shit is PUSHING on my laptop from both ends and I question if this is okay. The back slip is made of foam and surrounded by mesh — if the bag is full and you try to slip it over a suitcase handle, the foam will often fold it on itself within the mesh, and you have to weirdly unravel it. \n\n# The pull tabs on the side of the bag come off randomly and don't seem made for anything\n\nThere are two pull-tabs on one side and one pull-tab thing on the other. They are adjustable, but for some reason they can also can like... unbuckle/come off, see [this image](https://shop.tropicfeel.com/cdn/shop/files/Backpacks-Nest-SS22-All-Black-4-detail.jpg?v=1665397528&amp;width=900) to see what I mean. I don't understand what they are for, so I use them to hold 1-2 light carabiners. The crazy thing is I'll find my a carabiner on the floor sometimes, with the pull-strap unclipped and hanging off the bag. The strap was not too loose or too tight — it's as if when the bag goes sideways or upside-down the things risk unclipping.\n\n# Overall\n\nI just don't get it. I don't find it practical in any way — getting this bag to do \"what it does in the pictures\" is a challenge. I also find it extremely limited on space compared my cheap 30 L Amazon backpack, and difficult to access items with ease.\n\nMy reality with this bag is I use it for 2 night simple, non-camping sleepovers during the summer, when I don't need bulkier items. And at 2 nights I am PUSHING it. Like you can fit x2 underwear + socks, but really only 4 larger clothing items. To get six pieces in there plus the bottom piece, it’s meant for THIN summer tank tops and shorts, otherwise you’re looking at two regular sized outfits. Also, not sure if relevant, but again I am female, and I am a classic medium, sometimes a small. So it’s not like my clothes are particularly large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe kangaroo shoe pouch is my favourite part, and the zippers are good quality. A note on the kangaroo pouch, though: I sometimes have trouble getting my shoes in there, like it doesn’t fit a standard pair of crocs (women's size 8). It’s meant for thin shoes. My Tropicfeel shoes fit great lol, but that's Tropicfeel for you — made for itself. \n\nIt really feels like I fell for a gimmick and I feel silly. I want to love this bag. I told so many people about it and now I'm eating my words. Please change my mind because it’s too late to return it.",

            "body": "I like mine! But the 30L advertised capacity is a blatant lie. That relies on the smart packing cube being fully packed out at 10L and when it's full of 10L worth of stuff  it doesn't fit in the backpack.\n\nI got my bag because I was looking for a bag that can be compressed to a true personal item size (bags with expandable zippers don't reduce the height or width of the bag, only depth), have lots of different organization solutions, and still fit within even the most restrictive carry on guidelines when fully expanded. I use it as a personal item when I have a different main travel bag, or for short trips or trips where I can pack very light weight clothing. It cannot be my only travel bag.\n\nI am a larger framed female, 5 foot 7 and wear anywhere between a large and XXL in US sizes, for reference. Using the smart packing cube I can fully back the bag out with 5 shorts, 5 shirts, 7 pairs of panties, 3 bras, and some extra clothing for sleepwear. When using as an additional personal item bag or ad an EDC, the spider net and the additional straps on the side have been wonderful, I've used them for dirty towels, rolled up travel little boxes, wet jackets, dirty shoes, other pet supplies I don't want touching my stuff. It works well because I already had a need to store items in my bag, but yet somehow outside my bag not touching my stuff or getting the inside of my bag dirty at all. The size flexibility is also great for me. I think it's a good bag if you look at the gimmicky things like the spider net and kangaroo pouch and actually know what you're going to do with those features, and/or if you need an expandable bag that can actually get shorter, not just thinner. The gimmicky shit isn't solving any problem you didn't know you had or anything like that.",

I would forget half of those features if I had to use one.  For the kangaroo pouch, I highly doubt my size 12 shoes would even fit.\n\nThis screams \"85 piece camera accessory bundle\" to me.",
