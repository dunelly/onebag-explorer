I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs. This pack is lightweight, comfortable, with extra exterior stash space as well as two roomy water bottle holders.

I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs. This pack is lightweight, comfortable, with extra exterior stash space as well as two roomy water bottle holders.

I always take the 3.5mm wired earbuds for the plane infotainment system as well.",

I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs.

I have been honing my onebag loadout for a few years now starting with a Europe trip in 2018. I have been trying to get my pack down to 25L or under and successfully was able to get it down to 20L as shown here. Laundry was available at every location I stayed and therefore it was easy to do laundry throughout the trip. The weather was cool especially in the mornings and evenings which discourage clothes drying. Overall, I think this was as close to a perfect packing list for myself as I've come. I didn‚Äôt end up swimming, but would still take my swimming gear as it doesn‚Äôt take up too much space, and I enjoyed swimming last time (last summer) I traveled. I purchased toothpaste in Portugal as well as laundry detergent for convenience. I usually just do sink laundry with my bar soap which works very well. I‚Äôve tried MANY backpacks, and I have come to prefer this pack out of all of my other packs. This pack is lightweight, comfortable, with extra exterior stash space as well as two roomy water bottle holders.

The website pictures still show the normal pack (dump pocket, no lash points, and long luggage pass through). \n\nI‚Äôm very happy with this pack over what was expected. The zipper dump pocket is way more useful and the lash points address any needs to put a wet jacket on the outside. \n\nInside seems unchanged. ",

Then just attach that male part to the pack you want to attach in front. Of course you can use whatever size mates up, but my pack has 3/4\" webbing. Unfortunately the old 15L Farpoint bag does not fit the new Farpoint either, I think that is a much better day pack. I attached both ways in photo just for demonstration. Both are super simple.  I have reached out to Osprey and asked for the clips so I can just use on my old Day pack and hopefully they send them. I also will take the male clips and make them removable - maybe te to a carabiner so I can front attach any pack, or a sling, camera case, etc - using these \"universal\" female clips now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8e33n98romee1.jpeg?width=2992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1559bcd5e5fbb3dc3077c594ba34f5d7eb11eb0b",

                "body": "Ayy hello fellow Wolverine and LSA-er! \n\nYes, the kickstand is built into the bag. Essentially it's a sturdy metal rod that goes up either side of the bag and forms a sort of square bottom that allows the bag to stand on its own. It also acts as a solid frame for the pack making it much nicer to wear, especially given the floating mesh back panel. The biggest downside, especially for onebaggers, is that, given the solid frame, it doesn't compress down. So the dimensions of the pack are pretty much rigid although you can flatten it down a bit. If that doesn't bother you, like it doesn't me, this is a fantastic feature and bag.\n\nOther Osprey packs that have this are the Tropos 34, of which is essentially a larger Parsec, and the Radial 26, which is meant more for bike commuting but shares a lot of similarities with the Parsec and can expand to 34L. Definitely check them out! Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: I'll just add - the kickstand on the newest versions of Osprey packs works great even when empty, although it helps having something in the bag to sort of weight it down. Older versions are notorious for not being able to stand unless the bag has contents to make it heavier to \"activate\" the kickstand. The current version works great though!",

If I were properly traveling and not vacationing, I'd skim down and have a different pack list, but figured this would make for a decent enough dry run.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably would've preferred going for the Osprey Radial 26+8 and a packable hip pack or sling, like the matador waist pack. Regardless, the Parsec, which I use as an everyday pack, worked wonderfully here. I was able to shove two medium-sized eagle creek packing cubes into the pack - one into the main compartment, and one into the secondary compartment. If I didn't bring my laptop, it would've been an easier fit, because it was difficult getting them both to fit. It was doable, but I'd look to pack down to make it work better. The pack also carried the weight well, but I don't want to speak to that until I've had to carry it for a significant enough distance. The pack carries similar to a hiking pack which was a huge draw for me, so I'm hoping it'll continue to carry things well. Another great feature of the Parsec is the set of mesh bottle holders on the sides. I shoved a 22oz Hydroflask on one side, and a 40oz on the other side with no trouble at all. And of course, I love the kickstand so the pack stands up on its own. It works perfectly 9 times out of 10, so long as it's on flat and/or solid ground. It did not want to stay upright on my bed, for example.\n\nThe Patagonia has become a sort of EDC pack for me, and worked great here. I used it to carry my electronics and misc gear, along with my Osprey toiletry kit. The kit is fantastic. It carried all my toiletries, has a hook to hang on the wall, and packs down pretty damn small. I probably want to downsize on my GoToobs though, because I've been noticing that they take up a lot of space. I believe I have the 2.5oz bottles, so I'll either downsize to the 1.7oz, or probably just use different bottles altogether. I'm not the biggest fan of them since some of the contents gather around the lid but don't actually come out when you squeeze.\n\nIf you have any recs on places to save space and trim down, feel free to let me know.

It's a very simple card game wherein you have five decks of five cards upside down, each with varying levels of attack damage, shields which defend all attacks (I believe), and a crown that you are trying to destroy. You flip a card, and if it's an attack card, you choose one of your opponents five decks to attack, and essentially do this back and forward until one of you destroys the other's crown on the bottom of one of the piles.\n\nIt's a very simple game, and comes in such a small package!

                "body": "Ayy hello fellow Wolverine and LSA-er! \n\nYes, the kickstand is built into the bag. Essentially it's a sturdy metal rod that goes up either side of the bag and forms a sort of square bottom that allows the bag to stand on its own. It also acts as a solid frame for the pack making it much nicer to wear, especially given the floating mesh back panel. The biggest downside, especially for onebaggers, is that, given the solid frame, it doesn't compress down. So the dimensions of the pack are pretty much rigid although you can flatten it down a bit. If that doesn't bother you, like it doesn't me, this is a fantastic feature and bag.\n\nOther Osprey packs that have this are the Tropos 34, of which is essentially a larger Parsec, and the Radial 26, which is meant more for bike commuting but shares a lot of similarities with the Parsec and can expand to 34L. Definitely check them out! Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: I'll just add - the kickstand on the newest versions of Osprey packs works great even when empty, although it helps having something in the bag to sort of weight it down. Older versions are notorious for not being able to stand unless the bag has contents to make it heavier to \"activate\" the kickstand. The current version works great though!",

            "body": "Hello all! I recently vacationed for a 4 day weekend, and even though I traveled by car, I decided to use just my one-and-a-half bag setup. If I were properly traveling and not vacationing, I'd skim down and have a different pack list, but figured this would make for a decent enough dry run.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably would've preferred going for the Osprey Radial 26+8 and a packable hip pack or sling, like the matador waist pack. Regardless, the Parsec, which I use as an everyday pack, worked wonderfully here. I was able to shove two medium-sized eagle creek packing cubes into the pack - one into the main compartment, and one into the secondary compartment. If I didn't bring my laptop, it would've been an easier fit, because it was difficult getting them both to fit. It was doable, but I'd look to pack down to make it work better. The pack also carried the weight well, but I don't want to speak to that until I've had to carry it for a significant enough distance. The pack carries similar to a hiking pack which was a huge draw for me, so I'm hoping it'll continue to carry things well. Another great feature of the Parsec is the set of mesh bottle holders on the sides. I shoved a 22oz Hydroflask on one side, and a 40oz on the other side with no trouble at all. And of course, I love the kickstand so the pack stands up on its own. It works perfectly 9 times out of 10, so long as it's on flat and/or solid ground. It did not want to stay upright on my bed, for example.\n\nThe Patagonia has become a sort of EDC pack for me, and worked great here. I used it to carry my electronics and misc gear, along with my Osprey toiletry kit. The kit is fantastic. It carried all my toiletries, has a hook to hang on the wall, and packs down pretty damn small. I probably want to downsize on my GoToobs though, because I've been noticing that they take up a lot of space. I believe I have the 2.5oz bottles, so I'll either downsize to the 1.7oz, or probably just use different bottles altogether. I'm not the biggest fan of them since some of the contents gather around the lid but don't actually come out when you squeeze.\n\nIf you have any recs on places to save space and trim down, feel free to let me know. I already know multiple places I could trim down (like not bringing my laptop), but I'm here for any and all recs.\n\nPacking list:\n\nPACKS AND ORGANIZERS\n\n* Osprey Parsec 26L\n* Patagonia Atom Sling 8L\n* 2x Eagle Creek Medium Dirty/Clean Cubes\n* Tentree Mesh Organizer\n* Osprey Ultralight Toiletry Kit\n\nCLOTES\n\n* Tops\n   * 2x Goodfellow and Co.

It performed great for skiing as well.\n\n* Skiing Layers:\n   * North Face Tri-Climate 3 in 1 (waterproof shell only; it comes with a down layer, but I was nervous about down getting wet. Probably could have brought it without issue, but did not.\n   * (Worn) Columbia Fleece - Generic black Columbia Fleece. Super common looking. I wore this on the flight. Acted as my main insulation layer.\n   * Patagonia R1 - worn while skiing underneath the Columbia Fleece. Also used it to wrap around my laptop, since the pouch in the backpack is not super protective. Worked well.\n   * Patagonia Capilene Cool T-shirts x 3 - great shirts\n   * Smartwool 150 base layer pants - did great while skiing\n   * Smartwool 150 base layer long sleeve shirt (I never wore this. I really only brought it as a backup layer, depending on how cold the temps were while skiing, paranoid about freezing while stuck on a lift or something).\n   * Hanes meshy underwear (5 including the one I wore) - my everyday underwear. Nice and airy.\n   * Darn Tough Socks - (4 including the ones I wore). Love these socks. Basically all I wear.\n   * Burton Gloves - 10 years old, not anything special, but they do the trick.\n   * UnderArmour light gloves - never used these, but brought in case the Burton's needed a liner\n   * UnderArmour Sweatpants - worn over my base layer while skiing. Kept me warm enough, and are pretty nice. I don't have any nice ski pants, so used these as my insulating layer underneath my rain pants (below).\n   * REI Rain Pants - Fully wind and waterproof. I think these are 12 years old. They are pretty torn up, but they are still good enough for resort skiing. \n   * Patagonia Baggies - did not wear them on this trip, but i brought them because there was an outdoor hot tub. We did not use it though.\n   * Smartwool 150 beanie\n   * Buff brand merino buff\n* Tech\n   * iPhone 13\n   * 20 Watt Charger\n   * Lightning Cable\n   * Apple Watch (not shown in image)\n   * Apple MagSafe Duo Charger - overpriced, but I really like using it...\n   * Apple AirPods Pro - borrowed these from my wife. They were absolutely awesome on the flight. I could barely hear ANY noise with the cancellation option turned on.\n   * Microsoft Surface Pro laptop - had to bring to do some work on the flights.\n      * Charger\n* Toiletries - super basic stuff.\n   * toothbrush\n   * toothpast\n   * Deodorant\n* Worn on flights\n   * Levis 502 blue jeans\n   * Columbia Fleece (already mentioned in my skiing clothes above)\n   * Patagonia Cap Cool t-shirt (already mentioned in my skiing clothes above)\n*  Shoes\n   * Redwing Classic Chelsea in Hawthorn Muleskinner - I only brought this one shoe, since I would be skiing all day and didn't need to exercise or anything. They were perfect for this trip. Slip off and on easy for airport security and changing into ski boots. The boot was good for walking in snow and sleet, kept my fee dry. Perfect \"oneshoe\" for this trip.\n\nI think that is basically everything. It all worked out very well for this quick and easy out and back trip. Let me know if any questions.",

It performed great for skiing as well.\n\n* Skiing Layers:\n   * North Face Tri-Climate 3 in 1 (waterproof shell only; it comes with a down layer, but I was nervous about down getting wet. Probably could have brought it without issue, but did not.\n   * (Worn) Columbia Fleece - Generic black Columbia Fleece. Super common looking. I wore this on the flight. Acted as my main insulation layer.\n   * Patagonia R1 - worn while skiing underneath the Columbia Fleece. Also used it to wrap around my laptop, since the pouch in the backpack is not super protective. Worked well.\n   * Patagonia Capilene Cool T-shirts x 3 - great shirts\n   * Smartwool 150 base layer pants - did great while skiing\n   * Smartwool 150 base layer long sleeve shirt (I never wore this. I really only brought it as a backup layer, depending on how cold the temps were while skiing, paranoid about freezing while stuck on a lift or something).\n   * Hanes meshy underwear (5 including the one I wore) - my everyday underwear. Nice and airy.\n   * Darn Tough Socks - (4 including the ones I wore). Love these socks. Basically all I wear.\n   * Burton Gloves - 10 years old, not anything special, but they do the trick.\n   * UnderArmour light gloves - never used these, but brought in case the Burton's needed a liner\n   * UnderArmour Sweatpants - worn over my base layer while skiing. Kept me warm enough, and are pretty nice. I don't have any nice ski pants, so used these as my insulating layer underneath my rain pants (below).\n   * REI Rain Pants - Fully wind and waterproof. I think these are 12 years old. They are pretty torn up, but they are still good enough for resort skiing. \n   * Patagonia Baggies - did not wear them on this trip, but i brought them because there was an outdoor hot tub. We did not use it though.\n   * Smartwool 150 beanie\n   * Buff brand merino buff\n* Tech\n   * iPhone 13\n   * 20 Watt Charger\n   * Lightning Cable\n   * Apple Watch (not shown in image)\n   * Apple MagSafe Duo Charger - overpriced, but I really like using it...\n   * Apple AirPods Pro - borrowed these from my wife. They were absolutely awesome on the flight. I could barely hear ANY noise with the cancellation option turned on.\n   * Microsoft Surface Pro laptop - had to bring to do some work on the flights.\n      * Charger\n* Toiletries - super basic stuff.\n   * toothbrush\n   * toothpast\n   * Deodorant\n* Worn on flights\n   * Levis 502 blue jeans\n   * Columbia Fleece (already mentioned in my skiing clothes above)\n   * Patagonia Cap Cool t-shirt (already mentioned in my skiing clothes above)\n*  Shoes\n   * Redwing Classic Chelsea in Hawthorn Muleskinner - I only brought this one shoe, since I would be skiing all day and didn't need to exercise or anything. They were perfect for this trip. Slip off and on easy for airport security and changing into ski boots. The boot was good for walking in snow and sleet, kept my fee dry. Perfect \"oneshoe\" for this trip.\n\nI think that is basically everything. It all worked out very well for this quick and easy out and back trip. Let me know if any questions.",

        "selftext": "Just came home from a week-long overseas trip. I used my Kanken Laptop 15 as my carry-on and personal item backpack and while it fit everything I needed (1 compression pack full of clothes good for 6 days, toiletries, tech, my laptop), and I like the size of it on my body, I still feel like I needed just a teensy bit more space so it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs about to burst and more padding for my back and laptop (I had to walk for long hours and this backpack killed my shoulders.) Is the Osprey Daylite Plus more comfortable and would it have more space, perhaps? For context, Kanken Laptop 15 is about 18L. Should I go for Osprey Daylite Plus (with 20L) or just go for a bigger one like the The North Face Women‚Äôs Jester (22L) or Women‚Äôs Borealis (27L)? \n\nOr do you have any other suggestions? I want something that would give me bigger capacity (up to 27L) without excess weight and bulkiness because I‚Äôm a petite person. \n\nThank you! ",

I wrote a big intro thing but clicked on post picture and the whole write up is gone... oh wells, probably for the best that people don't have to read my dissertation. Short version: I started traveling as a musician about three years ago and went from a 40L backpack full of electronics, a duffle bag of clothes and way too much glamping gear to what you see in the pic. This is currently my grab and go bag for short music tours and fly out gigs. The electronics here are all mainly for songwriting/producing on the road. I really got into minimalism travel and have gotten used to only carrying one change of clothes (the merino wool burrito in the pic). Hand washing does the trick most of the time. Depending on climate and laziness, I can always stuff more clothes in the bag. The Osprey backpack can fit a surprising amount of stuff. Anyways, thank you r/onebag for the inspiration!

This held up the line a long time and by the end the last \\~20-25 people on the flight were waved through to expedite boarding. We didn't even scan the boarding pass as there was one worker who verbally relayed the Sequence code of everyone passing through to the other one on the computer.\n* Flight 4 - just about every bag that looked like it might barely meet the size requirements was tested. The worker was not paying as much attention so quite a few people took things out and put them on the ground and got the okay. Very strict about the second item though - if someone had any kind of purse or tote as well as a backpack, they were told to pay.\n* Note: I was never asked to use the sizer on any flights and very generous squishing was allowed for each flight.\n\nHope this helps someone as I had my own worries before these flights and have seen lots of posts about Frontier recently.\n\n[Frontier sizer](https://preview.redd.it/gztaw0hsr9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92a6d5351c391ba66e73576a511b727fa8623ccc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Frontier sizer - top view](https://preview.redd.it/lcajczyxr9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa33c3d798ec1a30dc9e2071c266b90d489d655f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Spirit sizer](https://preview.redd.it/fqaebyd3v9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=980f9ff0c2069dc7988ec5344698ab463ecf4df0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[spirit sizer - top view](https://preview.redd.it/ihqfanv4v9ua1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10e76c2e025fc9cfc37ddf52a61e311b7dfb1735)",
