I did a lot of research and read/watched sooo many reviews, but I found seeing the bags in person was the most helpful factor.\n\nI can go on and on about all of the pros and cons of each bag if you'd like, OP, but there are a lot of personal preferences you should consider! Here's what ultimately made me go with the Patagonia, if helpful -\n\n* I often travel for work so I prefer a bag with a laptop sleeve, or better, a separate laptop compartment\n* Even though I usually onebag, I like having the option of a luggage pass-through\n* I wanted a backpack that could also convert into a duffel\n* I don't love my Calpak Luka Duffle, and while they are different bags, I was worried it would be another situation of a very hyped up bag that doesn't suit my needs\n* I usually love a bright color, but someone mentioned that the shininess and bright colorways of some bags might attract more attention and make your bag get flagged for sizing\n* I didn't love the return policy on most of the bags and have also read some not-great reviews of their customer service\n* My friend had the Baboon bag, didn't like it, and asked me about other bag recs haha \n\nUltimately I just needed to pick one so I could use it to learn more about my own travel and packing style! Patagonia was the one I felt most comfortable with due to their great return policy and trade-in program. It's not to say that I won't ever try out the other bags and that my own travel/packing style won't change, but I'm pretty happy with the mini MLC for my needs right now.\n\nI really recommend thinking about your own packing style and bag preferences and choosing from there! They're all great bags in their own right and well loved",

I’m probably not describing this well (it’s been a long day). I didn’t find the Allpa as comfortable as the Calpak but I totally think that’s a personal thing depending on your height, weight, build, etc. I have the lavender and I like that it’s a little different but not totally “out there.” I’m still trying to figure out all the pockets!
