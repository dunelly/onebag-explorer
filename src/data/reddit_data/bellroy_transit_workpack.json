            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous.

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice?

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "I got the previous edition of [Bellroy Transit Workpack](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-workpack-previous-edition) in Nightsky over 40% off original price during Black Friday. Some impressions:\n \nPros\n- Love that it fits my [Aer Slim pouch](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/88CQ3MRegz) within the admin shelf that’s part of the laptop compartment. It means I don’t have to open the rest of the bag most of the time. \n- I think this version is superior to second edition with two internal water bottle pockets (you don’t have to use them for water bottles) and the top sunglasses/quick-access pocket that aren’t present in V2\n- This is more of a V1.5. I bought this bag in a slightly different shade of blue a few years ago, and they made some improvements:  straps no longer loosen on their own due to thicker webbing material used, the back panel is more comfortable (thicker padding?)\n- The interior volume is spacious even with water bottle intruding part of the space. [Here’s a pack out done by the Mountainborn](https://youtu.be/zsJe8q3IP8U?t=1265&amp;si=6wD0sq5AqyBJ3SLD) for reference.  I only have [my Alpaka Meto Pouch V1 that houses my DJI Neo](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/kZqKhmcbVA) and my glasses case in it. \n- Love the use of metal and leather hardware\n- It stands on its own when the bottom is packed full. \n\nCons: \n- Don’t care for the shiny aquaguard zips. I wish they used the matte versions found on V2 and earlier versions of this edition instead. \n- The water bottle pockets fit my Yeti 18oz Rambler, but it won’t fit anything larger.",

Typically I've always had a roller that usually goes in the overhead bin along with a small backpack. But decided to remove that outright and just settle for one bag and nothing else.\n\nHence the 28 Liter Bellroy Transit bag\n\n**The Dilemma**\n\nI was debating between the 20 Liter and the 28 Liter. There's a ton of happy campers with the 20 Liter variant but admittedly they mentioned that the 20 liter wasn't a Onebag travel bag. It's more used for EDC stuff.\n\n**Gripes and Gloss**\n\nThere's things that people love about this bag. And there's things people don't like.\n\nPeople love the look of it. It really is a beautiful looking bag.\n\nPeople love the simplicity of it\n\nPeople love that it's a clamshell opening\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05oj2v3q3r591.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2093738683a890eefa2d4030a6b11693de7ecd67\n\nPeople love that it can be used as carry-on\n\nPeople love that it  can be used as a personal item if you don't stuff it\n\nPeople love that it can be used as an EDC bag somewhat if you don't stuff it\n\nPeople hate the water pouch. Problem is that the water pouch can't even fit a 20 oz Zojirushi bottle. It also eats into the space.\n\nPeople are so-so about the comfort of it.\n\nPeople don't like the consistency of it. The black version is the best made version. It's not just a color thing. The entire material is different depending on what color you choose.  If you choose a blue one, it's something else entirely and looks far cheaper. Bellroy has different material depending on which variant of the 28 liter you get. The best version is the black one. Don't get the other colors as those are made of uglier, cheaper materials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1o8t44v14r591.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45ff65a7e316bdbdedf4c9b67cf1365f078ad94e\n\n**Ok so how much can it hold?**\n\nSo it can hold quite a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n**All of the images below are what fit inside the bag.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FRONT POCKET\n\n[2 wet wipes, coin bag, passport, 2 pens, Logitech K380, Vapur water bottle, Field notes](https://preview.redd.it/wbkveg8hcr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43d789401993068b1f2f42fb78c558d7cf743c4d)\n\n# INSIDE THE CLAMSHELL OPENING\n\n[2 shorts, Matador towel, eye cover](https://preview.redd.it/4fpoacnncr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86fe59c9c156e717307e87eb9087d78d14f3e055)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A bunch of Anker cables, chargers, Logitech Pebble, thumb drive, battery, USB hub, tiny flashlight](https://preview.redd.it/2evp2auucr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=193768bd43c0ffedb15ae4174fb5ef7e00339ca1)\n\n[4 shirts, 4 underwear, 4 socks](https://preview.redd.it/1ngbcbl1dr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15649862061bc504b45cebca64f723f28f6b7bde)\n\n[OneBlade, chapstick, deodorant, contact lens, lotion, sunblock, Toothbrush, melatonin, earplugs, cologne \\(I just realized I needed to add toothpaste\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rjtmjpu1er591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a338fdd953fdd655f20db82ce13dfd2cca0d920e)\n\n[Sennheiser MKH 416, XLR cable, portable neck pillow, belt, shockmount, Tripod, Zoom F3](https://preview.redd.it/q44153badr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bf169a1214188699a79eb28266e1af5166c6667)\n\n# BACK OPENING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Moondrop Blessing 2, Surface Go, Macbook Pro](https://preview.redd.it/4tpllupger591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b0268757571c3f4a7f2bf9126107a4a5f67193)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok so how bad are the flaws of this bag?**\n\nSo as mentioned there are 2 major flaws of this bag. The 1st flaw is that there's a slot in the back where you're supposed to put a water bottle. But the problem is that when you put a water bottle in there it's very difficult to take out. I consider myself fairly athletic and it wasn't easy to take out. Required a lot of force with a Zojirushi 20 oz bag.\n\n2nd major flaw is that the straps are a bit thin. They also kind of have an edge to them. So it can be uncomfortable.\n\n**Can it be fixed?**\n\nYes! In a way.\n\nHere was my workaround.\n\nI just didn't use the water pouch. Instead I just brought a Vapur Water bottle instead. The problem with using the water pouch is that when you put a water bottle inside, it eats into your space. So I solved the problem by just not getting a hard-case water bottle. That said if I really really wanted to get a water bottle like a Hydroflask to work on this, I'd either pack it inside or I'd attach it with a carabine on the outside.\n\n**But what about the straps?**\n\nI found a way to fix the problem. What you can do is buy shoulder pads on Amazon and when you attach them to the bag it becomes much much more comfortable. So I modded the Bellroy bag to be super duper comfortable by buying one of these shoulder pads. Shoulder pads like these: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHKVRX7/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHKVRX7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yf18hwxcku591.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3518d54b89475a283d92eced3adb1dfcd85940cd\n\n**How much did it weigh in the end?**\n\nIt weighed a total of 15 pounds for everything here. So by all accounts it should be enough to pass through to any airline.\n\n**My overall thoughts**\n\nI am super stoked with this bag! I love how it looks. And as mentioned, when you add the shoulder pads, it makes it super comfortable. And I don't mind that I don't use the water pouch - because by just using a Vapur water bottle, I save so much space. So overall a really great Onebag. I'd even argue that I should and could be bringing much less. But this just goes to show how much it can hold! :D\n\nThat's all folks! :D",
