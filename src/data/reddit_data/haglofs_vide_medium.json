I love the addition of the front mesh pocket for a rain jacket and co. There also attachment loops arround the Front mesh pocket wich can get really handy. It also has a removeable minimalist hip belt. There is also a whistle on the chest clip and inside you can put your laptop or a hydration blader. There is also a small pocket with a key sling.\nWhen you can get it for under 80 bucks i'll recommend it, its hard to beat at that price point",

        "selftext": "Good morning,\n\nI've been looking for a little jacket to add to my bag. I'll usually wear a coat during my travel, but I'd like to have an option when it's not too cold but I still want protection from wind/rain.\n\nI immediately jumped to order that [Houdini](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/product/mens-houdini-windbreaker-jacket/24142.html) I'd been eyeing from afar, only to realize... It has no side pockets! Which honestly is a deal breaker for me ; whether it's for putting stuff or simply my hands, I'm so used to them I would not consider buying any sort of \"last layer\" without it. Besides, since I've been looking at other products now, I realize I'd like something a bit more \"high end\", with better rain protection and some breathability.\n\nSo I've been looking around... I found some stuff, but I'd like this sub's inputs, as I'm always amazed by how knowledgeable in gears some of yall are.\n\n**My \"must\" :**\n\n* Hoodie\n* Side pockets\n* Windbreaker + rain resistant\n* Some sort of breathability\n* 200 bucks AT MOST. 100-150 is preferable\n* Ideally packable ; in any case something relatively lightweight and not taking too much space\n\n**The runner-ups :**\n\n* [Patagonia's Granite Crest](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/product/mens-granite-crest-waterproof-rain-jacket/194187948498.html) : very pricey. A shame, because it is an incredible piece. A bit heavy (around 400g). Think it's my favorite for my needs, but price is rough ; the hood is VERY large, even with the tools to make it a bit tighter, and the visor comes very low on the eyes. I'm sure it's great if you're wearing a helmet for instance, but without, not the best hood tbh. When you close the jacket, it goes very high up also, like right under your eyes.\n* [Montbell's Versalite](https://euro.montbell.com/products/disp.php?p_id=2328169) : gets recommended a lot. Order it on [Japanese shop](https://en.montbell.jp/products/goods/disp.php?product_id=2328169) (\"US model\" if you want pit zips) to get a discount. Keep in mind your local country tax might apply a supplement when going through customs (I know in my country I have to add a 30% fee, which makes it kinda expensive).\n* [Path Project's Graves PX](https://pathprojects.com/products/graves-px-shell-jacket?variant=40980278771773) : pretty lightweight, great design. Unfamiliar with the brand. The reviews on their website are pretty laudatory though! Would love some more insight.\n* [Outdoor Research's Foray II](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/products/mens-foray-ii-jacket-287615?variant=46585603981633) : pricey, but full Gore-Tex. Huge pit-zips that can even make it a \"poncho\", why not.\n* [REI's Rainier](https://www.rei.com/product/227570/rei-co-op-rainier-rain-jacket-mens) : most cost-effective of the short-list, even though you'll have to add 20-30 bucks for international shipping. In theory has it all. Will have to check more about it.\n\n**Right behind, these are strong \"maybe\" :**\n\n* [Patagonia's Torrentshell 3L ](https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-torrentshell-3l-rain-jacket/85241.html?dwvar_85241_color=ENLB&amp;cgid=mens-jackets-vests-windbreaker): A bit pricey, but gets recommended a lot ! Even if on the higher side in terms of weight (400g, when most jackets in the list are around 280-350g), definitely a serious contender. The fabric is pretty noisy however.\n* [Patagonia's Slate Sky](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/product/mens-slate-sky-waterproof-rain-jacket/85020.html?dwvar_85020_color=SMDB): very similar to the Torrentshell, with a different design, no pit-zips (different ventilation system, probably less effective), but 100g lighter. Doesn't seem packable. Tighter fit too : probably better looking (in particular if you're tall and thin), but it might be complicated to layer effectively. Patagonia seem to discontinue it, only available in specific sizes and colors at the moment. EDIT : Replaced by the [Boulder Fork](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/product/mens-boulder-fork-waterproof-rain-jacket/196924671133.html).\n* [Montbell's Rain Hiker](https://www.montbell.us/products/disp.php?cat_id=25013&amp;p_id=2328247&amp;gen_cd=1) : a cost-effective alternative to the acclaimed Versalite. Pretty lightweight at 260g. Higher side pockets, good if you're wearing a sling, but afraid it's not that comfortable to simply leave your hands in. Interesting design (but maybe a bit too \"sporty\" ?).\n* [Black Diamond's Alpine Start](https://www.rei.com/product/216807/black-diamond-alpine-start-hoodie-mens?cm_mmc=aff_AL-_-38931-_-52463-_-NA&amp;avad=52463_f3965ac59) : pretty lightweight. But comments on REI's website keep mentioning how it isn't waterproof past a light rain.\n* [Rab's Borealis](https://www.rei.com/product/205807/rab-borealis-jacket-mens?cm_mmc=aff_AL-_-38931-_-52463-_-NA&amp;avad=52463_e3964c93d) : a \"budget\" BD's Alpine. Heavier, but also offer more weather protection. Double chest pocket is overkill but well ; no side pockets. **Should look into the Kinetic.**\n* [Marmot's Precip](https://www.marmot.eu/men/jackets/precip-eco-jacket/AFS_889169477621.html) :  ticks all the boxes, seems like a good fit. The fabric seem noisy though, any input? People also have been pointing out it might not be as long-lasting as other brands.\n* [Outdoor Research's Ferrosi](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/products/mens-ferrosi-hoodie-287617/) : in terms of practicality, it has a lot going for it (although I'm afraid about this low waterproofing indicator). There is a [Duraprint](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/products/mens-ferrosi-duraprint-hoodie-300903?variant=47372866257217) version, with a design I personally dislike. On sale atm, an interesting pick.\n* [Outdoor Research's Stratoburst Stretch](https://www.rei.com/product/230796/outdoor-research-stratoburst-stretch-rain-jacket-mens) : a cheaper alternative to the acclaimed Helium AscentShell. Looks good in theory, can't find much about it online though. Maybe a bit \"simple\" looking ? Not sure.\n* [Eddie Bauer's Cloud Cap](https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/38888580/men's-cloud-cap-rain-jacket?color=Black&amp;sp=1&amp;size=&amp;sizeType=) : 2.5L jacket that ticks the boxes. I'm not familiar with the brand, but got recommended a couple times. Cost effective (sale atm). Maybe not the best design (seem sorta \"flashy\").\n\n**Potential other jackets** (misses element(s) of the \"must\" list, or not as appealing for some reason) **:**\n\n* [Patagonia's Houdini](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/product/mens-houdini-windbreaker-jacket/24142.html) : misses the side pockets. No breathability and not much rain protection. There is not much better in terms of weight and packability however...\n* [REI's flash](https://www.rei.com/product/202485/rei-co-op-flash-jacket-mens) : ... except maybe the flash ? Basically a Houdini with pockets.\n* [Uniqlo's pocketable parka](https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/product/uv-protection-pocketable-parka-444550.html) : another \"Houdini with pockets\". Cheap, but not very effective in terms of rain protection (maybe even less than the Houdini and the Flash ? Would need confirmation).\n* [Patagonia's Storm 10](https://eu.patagonia.com/fr/fr/product/mens-storm10-alpine-jacket/85125.html): same as the Slate Sky, might be too tight to layer effectively, and no pit-zips. Pricey. Very, very lightweight however, for a jacket that offers that kind of protection and build-quality that is.\n* [Grunden's Trident ](https://grundens.com/collections/fishing-jackets/products/trident-jacket): looks good in theory, but can't find much about it. Will have to dig!\n* [Columbia's Watertight II](https://www.columbia.com/p/mens-watertight-ii-jacket-1533891.html?dwvar_1533891_color=464) : relatively inexpensive compared to the same products of other brands, and ticks (in theory) all the boxes. I'm not a fan of the velcro, but for that price that's acceptable. A 2L jacket however, probably a bit less high-end quality wise.\n* [Columbia's Glennaker](https://www.columbia.com/p/mens-glennaker-lake-jacket-1442361.html) : bicolor (not so good looking imo), and less water resistant than the Watertight. However pretty cheap!\n* [Columbia's Inner Limits](https://www.columbiasportswear.fr/FR/p/veste-de-randonnee-impermeable-inner-limits%C2%A0iii-homme-2071215.html?dwvar_2071215_color=010) : seems a fine jacket ; not packable though.\n* [Quechua's MH500](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/veste-legere-impermeable-de-randonnee-mh500-homme/_/R-p-301681?mc=8612171&amp;c=noir) : relatively interesting price. Not packable, pretty heavy at 500+ grams. Caught in the middle between price and quality, it seems (very Decathlon-esque).\n* [Salomon's Sense Aero Wind](https://www.salomon.com/fr-fr/shop-emea/product/sense-aero-wind-lc12954.html#color=89628): haven't seen it mentioned anywhere, but seems pretty straightforward. Not packable though.\n* [Eddie Bauer's Rainfall](https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/10112579/men's-packable-rainfoil(r)-jacket?color=Black&amp;sp=1&amp;size=&amp;sizeType=) : a jacket that fits, but 2L.\n* [Helly Hansen's Loke](https://www.hellyhansen.com/en_fr/loke-jacket-62252) : got it all on paper, but reviews I've been reading are moderately thrilled.\n* [Carharrt's Rain Defender](https://www.carhartt.com/ProductDisplay?storeId=715838034&amp;urlLangId=-2&amp;productId=3074457345616922677&amp;urlRequestType=Base&amp;country=FR&amp;productPrefix=produits&amp;langId=-2&amp;catalogId=3074457345616677219) : pretty simple jacket, not too costly, interesting design. Doesn't zip all the way, not too big of an issue. However reviews mention it is pretty short and makes a \"crop top\" for tall men (which I am).\n* [Tierra's Backup](https://www.tierra.com/eu/en-gb/men/tops/jackets/back-up-jacket-gen3-m) – [OR's Helium AscentShell](https://www.outdoorresearch.com/products/mens-helium-ascentshell-jacket-287614) – [Arc'teryx Beta](https://arcteryx.com/fr/fr/shop/mens/beta-jacket-8584) – And many more... All great fit, but way too pricey. Look for sales!\n\nSorry fort that LONG post for a simple coat. Hope it wasn't too boring to read, and thanks in advance for all suggestions !\n\n**EDIT** : Editing the post a couple times to include suggested jackets, even if they don't fit my needs. I know I like to find posts with all the infos summarized when looking for gear, so if that can help people in the foreseeable future...",

My only question would then be : how comfortably can you layer under it ? Let's say you'd want to put a base layer, a fleece and a puff, would it be hard to move ?",
