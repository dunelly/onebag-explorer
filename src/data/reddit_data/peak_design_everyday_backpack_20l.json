In my use case it affected how i use the bag when outside. The v2 is still better in many ways like the zippers used which was obvious immediately when i switched, but for the things i use a backpack for, it wasnt much of an upgrade - and since i prefer the look of the v1, jumped the gun when i saw it on sale. Its purely subjective indeed but for me the v1 has that iconic look while the v2 was more of a casual look which maybe made it more appealing to a wider audience, just not for me",

It sounds like you're using travel backpack for EDC as well as travel which is something I might be interested in doing as well. Currently kind of torn between the everyday zip 20L but I think it might be a little bit too small and the 30L travel backpack.\n\nHow does the travel bag handle EDC? Is it possible to access the main compartment by just opening the zippers at the top like a more standard toploading bag or do you really have to put it down and unzip the whole panel to grab something out of it?\n\nAlso what does the travel backpack allow you to pack inside of it that the everyday zip couldn't handle?\n\nThanks in advance!",

The 45L is nice because its standard capacity is 35L and can go down to 30 where the 30L standard is 27L and expanded is 30 so its inly a tiny bit smaller VS the 45L fully packed down\n\nEdit: added some stuff after \"IMO\"",

The dividers can be pretty frustrating to work with as well.\n\nHowever, those issues are less problematic with larger lenses/bodies, which is what I originally bought the bag for. It holds my Pentax 67 kit pretty easily and I can stick a Rolleiflex into one of the fold up dividers in addition to that. Those same dividers are actually really nice for my 4x5 field camera too. Plus there's all the extra space for non photo gear and the laptop compartment is good.\n\nComfort wise it's fine for my back/shoulders, I wouldn't wear it fully loaded for extended periods though. It's fine for commuting/hopping between other forms of transport aside from walking. \n\nIt's not as easy to work with as a proper photo backpack where you can see everything laid out, it's more like a big messenger bag with a harness. It's been my go to bag ever since I got it in November even though I have two other really nice backpacks (an ILE Default Mini and a Crumpler Jackpack Pro) since it marries the photo-friendliness of the Crumpler with the comfort and space (for non photo stuff) of my ILE.

            "body": "My dad has got the exact bag, and I do think it is very well built, and exceptional as a day pack for a professional photographer. I make this qualifiers because it is exceptional at what it does, but not everyone needs that protection level.\n\nI would recommend looking for an Osprey bag; perhaps a Questa or Quasar. They will be roughly the same size bag, with a whole lot more useable area and less padding and protection. This means instead of putting gear like a camera directly in the bag in a padded compartment, I keep my camera in a softsided case and a proper location to keep it safe. \n\nAll that being said, your needs may not be the same as mine and if what I described is more what you need it could be worth waiting and saving for. As the saying goes, buy once cry once and we all know we should be aiming to be using as few bags as possible.",

I’d recommend looking at something with a bit more of an open concept and a bit less structure, like maybe the Bellroy Classic or Classic Plus. I tried packing my v1 everyday for travel and it just wasn’t a great option IMO.",

Do you also need a laptop compartment, or are you okay because you have a laptop sleeve / clothing as padding? \n\n&gt; Durability and security of zipper \n\nMany $60+ backpacks will have good quality zippers. \n\n&gt; Minimalist Design\n\nIn other words, it looks good. This is the hardest part to fulfill, because it depends on the person and what they like. \n\nTwo suggestions I have: [Able Carry Daybreaker](https://ablecarry.com/products/daybreaker?variant=31275037556849) and [Osprey Arcane Large.](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/arcane-large-day-ARCANLGDAYS20.html) They are in the $100-110 range, but I can't think of anything cheaper that has a similarly sleek look and good build quality.",
