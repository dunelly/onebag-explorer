      "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

The carry system on the Osprey is unmatched and we really felt it on walks even five minutes or more. The packing organization on the border is way better BUT it can make you feel like you can pack more than you should since the pack gets fat and the weight just gets further from your back and the bag even less ergonomic. If you carry less than 7 kg than the border is awesome! But any more weight and the Osprey becomes the winner.",

The Gregory Border can be found in black for $189 on a handful of sites. I wasn't thrilled about the black, but saw that a site in the Netherlands called outdoorxl had the brown on sale.  After shipping (which only took 3 days!), the bag was about $209, so I figured what's $20 more if I like it better and it will last a long time.  Both bags used to be available in more colors.  The fact that they haven't been restocked online makes me wonder if a new model will be coming out in the near future.",

Sort of how some guys call the Nicks 11067 Last a “Popeye boot”. The 310 takes that sprung toe and curved shape even more extreme. I was looking on ebay for 310’s to see it in other leathers and realized it looks way better without a cap toe (the current offering on Viberg’s site). I may have to look into these.\n\nI’m curious about the fit of the 310 and Vibergs in general. Their site seems to suggest a full size down from brannock. I always question that, as I go 1/2 size down and sometimes still find the boot too tight. I think this “full size down” has been a recommendation based off people’s sneaker size, which is always larger than brannock. All sneakers run small in my experience, so most people wear a sneaker 1/2 size larger than their brannock. I honestly think this confusion between brannock and sneaker size cause 80% of the boot sizing issues for buyers.\n\nDo you have experience with a Viberg in 310 Last? Tell me about them. Thanks!",

They follow the vintage Canadian Military sizing (same as Dayton Boots does), which is similar to UK sizing... but not quite.  It's best to know your sizing in Vibergs in that particular last -- but once you know , you can always buy confidently, because they are utterly damn reliable in having identical sizing and fit (UNlike Dayton Boots).",

You can either replace the slider, which involves a small cut at the end and installing a new slider and stop. We make [Zipper Rescue Kits](https://zipperrescue.com/) for clothing and outdoor gear, providing affordable access to parts and instructions. \n\nOr, you can pinch that slider on the back end at both corners, just a little bit to tighten up the slider so it'll mesh the teeth. Don't over pinch, you still want it to slide easy and can always pinch more. Usually you can pinch a quality slider a couple times before it need to be replaced. Hope this helps for any future zipper issues!",

Had a random rear rack not designed for minivelos or folders and it worked just fine with panniers, but had to have the panniers shoved to the rearmost position and the rack might have had a slightly rearward angle instead of being perfectly level. When I was loaded down, the weight affected handling adversely, so there's that.\n\nI *did* get heelstrike when I tried running a child seat on the rack on the Nano.\n\nAnyway, I think it will be easy to find a rack that won't cause heelstrike with the rack's stays, so a trunk bag should be no problem at all.

      "selftext": "Hi there everyone,\n\nI was looking for reviews on the Gregory Border Traveler 40 and I was unable to find any but did find some posts asking for it. I figured it'll be a bit more popular due the Gregory brand but it seems many here usually just recommend Osprey Farpoint 40 over anything else (I did try it, was a bit heavy and the shoulder straps didn't seem to mesh with me). So I bought the Gregory Border Traveler 40 and decided to make a quick review on it. Please note I am not an expert reviewer and I am posting this for those who wish to find out more info on the Gregory Border Traveler 40.\n\nWhat did I like about it? The separate compartment for dirty clothes (The blue portion of the bag) where you could either put dirty clothes or use it for more storage space. I also like the design of the bag and there is obviously a lot of space for 40l and the shoulder straps feel comfortable.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that it's a one size fits all. The bag is huge and if you are short then the bag would go down past your hips and would most likely be sitting near your tailbone. I like the bag but may end up returning for a smaller bag around 30l since I've been cutting down on items that I would like to carry with me on my trip.\n\nEDIT: I tried pulling the shoulder straps more and apparently it could be pulled down even further than I thought (there was a snag that made me stop initially) and now the backpack sits above the tailbone. Just wanted to clarify that. I had tried to add pictures in the initial post but apparently none were posted, I don't post very often so I am not sure if I did something wrong). Bag is very comfortable even with 16 pounds of weight, barely feel the weight on my shoulders. Laptop compartment is just a slot with no padding really.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uk2c8vdwxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e9f4fc2d780390cc41e56e9bbdde9e4869d7e46\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9dh50ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5546d58918e6d5e9a36e1f59661ae5c6517816bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsri30ewxgfa1.jpg?width=2599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda674edd1b1b05220d7eca713969fc4c21ada21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c58b88ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3013&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a051bde4cea1927ba472cbf059c2dd175a7aed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00mxn1ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=819606d7a022f58eb27b6e72ba3b1f20f9a8efc8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n57xy4ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a0fc7b2d157e114fe532343118aa8e452cca7c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6n1mm2ewxgfa1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf0fd061395fe32c72422a782c5a57e73dcc0624\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0wue8ewxgfa1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3e20f82dd000476c75731e9045c6a013d708ee7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3dsdrwdwxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=598e96cd76ddf831fbe21861a736d312b9c4f056",

I think the Gregory would be a better constructed bag, and have nicer shoulder straps but I'm a small-size person so I am currently leaning towards the Cotopaxi Allpa, due to the waist belt.... but is the Cotopaxi all hype?\n\nThe Gregory and Cotopaxi are very close functionality-wise, very similar bags. I recently have taken a deep dive and done a lot of looking. Doesn't seem to be as much on the Gregory. I don't think you could go wrong with either bag. Especially for travel, the Gregory is actually lighter to start with by about 500g. The only difference I see is the outside coating/thicker material on the Cotopaxi, it comes with a rain cover and then the waist belt. The Gregory is also about $50 cheaper where I am. depends on if its fair weather travel /something to consider. Happy travelling!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: the Gregory does have a better design if you are putting the bag on a suitcase, it sits horizontally and has a strap built in.",

      "selftext": "Hi there everyone,\n\nI was looking for reviews on the Gregory Border Traveler 40 and I was unable to find any but did find some posts asking for it. I figured it'll be a bit more popular due the Gregory brand but it seems many here usually just recommend Osprey Farpoint 40 over anything else (I did try it, was a bit heavy and the shoulder straps didn't seem to mesh with me). So I bought the Gregory Border Traveler 40 and decided to make a quick review on it. Please note I am not an expert reviewer and I am posting this for those who wish to find out more info on the Gregory Border Traveler 40.\n\nWhat did I like about it? The separate compartment for dirty clothes (The blue portion of the bag) where you could either put dirty clothes or use it for more storage space. I also like the design of the bag and there is obviously a lot of space for 40l and the shoulder straps feel comfortable.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that it's a one size fits all. The bag is huge and if you are short then the bag would go down past your hips and would most likely be sitting near your tailbone. I like the bag but may end up returning for a smaller bag around 30l since I've been cutting down on items that I would like to carry with me on my trip.\n\nEDIT: I tried pulling the shoulder straps more and apparently it could be pulled down even further than I thought (there was a snag that made me stop initially) and now the backpack sits above the tailbone. Just wanted to clarify that. I had tried to add pictures in the initial post but apparently none were posted, I don't post very often so I am not sure if I did something wrong). Bag is very comfortable even with 16 pounds of weight, barely feel the weight on my shoulders. Laptop compartment is just a slot with no padding really.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uk2c8vdwxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e9f4fc2d780390cc41e56e9bbdde9e4869d7e46\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9dh50ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5546d58918e6d5e9a36e1f59661ae5c6517816bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsri30ewxgfa1.jpg?width=2599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda674edd1b1b05220d7eca713969fc4c21ada21\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c58b88ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3013&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15a051bde4cea1927ba472cbf059c2dd175a7aed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00mxn1ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=819606d7a022f58eb27b6e72ba3b1f20f9a8efc8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n57xy4ewxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02a0fc7b2d157e114fe532343118aa8e452cca7c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6n1mm2ewxgfa1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf0fd061395fe32c72422a782c5a57e73dcc0624\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0wue8ewxgfa1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3e20f82dd000476c75731e9045c6a013d708ee7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3dsdrwdwxgfa1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=598e96cd76ddf831fbe21861a736d312b9c4f056",
