        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/13jb7a9/bag_review_mec_pangea_60_4020_travel_pack/",
        "selftext": "I‚Äôm not usually one to post online reviews, but there aren‚Äôt *any* interior photos of this pack online, so I‚Äôm hoping this will help someone (especially since the MEC sale ends tomorrow, May 17).\n\nI borrowed a friend‚Äôs Mountain Equipment Coop (now Mountain Equipment Company) backpack for a few trips 7-9 years ago and fell in love with it. I bought an Osprey 70L (55+15) bag in 2016 thinking all backpacks were created equal. Of course, I was sorely mistaken, and I spent the last 7 years thinking about all the things I preferred in the MEC bag (particularly the organization options and spaces to stash things in case of an emergency).\n\nI‚Äôm now planning an 18-month round-the-world trip (starting August 2024) and I‚Äôve decided not to check a bag. I was looking at the Osprey 40L Fairview since I already have the Osprey daypack from my 70L purchase years ago. But with MEC‚Äôs current sale, I found that the 60L (40L + 20L) Pangea would actually be $40 cheaper than the Osprey 40L‚Ä¶which led me to the realization that there aren‚Äôt any interior photos.\n\nMy Pangea just arrived, and I‚Äôm thrilled to say that MEC continues to make excellent packs. I‚Äôm SO glad I took a chance and ordered this bag instead of sticking with Osprey.\n\nI prefer the side-zip ‚ÄúD-shaped‚Äù clamshell opening of the Pangea 40L, and I like that the 40L bag comes with a zipped compartment on the top, where I can keep my toiletry bag (the large blue pack, full of meds, ointments, shampoo bars, etc.) and/or a jacket for easy access on travel days. I also love that the bag comes with a raincover (which saves me even more money).\n\nWith the 20L daypack, I love the size of the front/top zipped compartment, as it‚Äôs big enough for all of my chargers, adapter, cords, etc. (in the blue pack). The Osprey 15L daypack‚Äôs front/top zipped compartment was never quite big enough for more than a charger, one cord, and one adapter. I also found the proportions of the Osprey 15L daypack frustrating ‚Äì I felt like I was always stuffing things down the sides. The Pangea 20L daypack also has much better side pockets for my Grayl water bottle (which never fit in the Osprey side pockets, even when the pack was empty).\n\nI think my Osprey bag is a *little* bit more comfortable, but I might just not have the Pangea straps adjusted right quite yet. I do find the hip straps to be much more comfortable on the Pangea, though. I'm primarily an urban traveler, so I'll leave the outdoorsy hiker trek reviews to someone else üòâ\n\nObviously, I haven‚Äôt traveled with this bag yet, but I wanted to get this review up before the MEC sale ends tomorrow, in case anyone‚Äôs on the fence about buying it. Like I said, I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, so feel free to ask any questions or request more photos if there‚Äôs anything I haven‚Äôt mentioned!\n\n\nWhat I have in this \"practice pack\":\n\n40L (organized by packing cube):\n9 tshirts\n2 tank tops\n2 long-sleeved tees\n\n2 shorts\n1 hoodie\n1 non-denim pants\n1 running pants\n1 running shorts\n1 running shirt\n1 sports bra\nSwimsuit\n\nXL travel towel &amp; washcloth\nBeanie\n2 sporks\nChopsticks\nExtra Grayl filter\n\nScarf\n12 underwear\n4 pairs of socks (including 1 wool)\nTin mug\n\nBasic makeup\nHairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste, tweezers, nail clippers, etc.\nShampoo, conditioner, and soap bars\nMedicines (OTC &amp; 3 prescriptions), bandaids, sunscreen, bug spray, ointments, etc.\nPeriod products\nClothesline\n\nChromebook\n\n20L:\nMy handbag (wayyy bigger and heavier than what I'll travel with, but it fit nonetheless!)\nDSLR camera\nE-reader\nSpeaker\nFleece jacket\n\nChargers\nExtension cord\nAdapters\n\nGrayl water bottle\n\n\nAnd not relevant to the bag review, but just in case anyone's curious...items I don't have packed here but will take with me:\n1 pair of sandals\nN95 masks\nZiploc bags\nCorkscrew\nMosquito net",

It‚Äôs not the perfect bag but I like it a lot. I use another smaller  eBag as my daily carry so I‚Äôm real comfortable with how it wears. For instance there‚Äôs a grab handle on one side and I reflexively slide the bag off that side and grab this handle. They also have a feature they call a ‚Äògarage‚Äô which is a semi rigid container that sits on the bottom of the bag. I used another one from my other bag so that I had two on this trip. One for tech stuff and one for toiletries.\n\nOur journey led us from the Scottish Highlands to the beach in Athens and finally to Northern Texas so it was challenging for us to have a versatile wardrobe. In the end, I used every piece of clothing I had and enjoyed having the flexibility it provided.\n\nI took cotton because I owned it and I couldn‚Äôt come to terms with spending so much on merino products. I wore clean t-shirt/socks/underwear almost everyday (there were a couple of travel days where I might rewear a tshirt). This meant we were visiting laundry mats or sink washing frequently. It was all part of the adventure. There were a couple days in Rome where we put on some serious walking and my socks got funky and I wished I did have merino. \n\nI did not one bag in the strictest sense. I carried a cheap collapsible backpack that folds up to the size of my fist. This was probably one of the most important things we took with us. We used it for day hikes, grocery shopping, laundry days etc. I also carried a slim sling for my super important stuff and some pocket things (extra headphones, tissues).\n\nThoughts/lessons learned: I wish I would have had a more robust battery system. I liked the MagSafe battery but it only gave my phone about half a charge and I couldn‚Äôt use it for any of my other devices. The duct tape and clothesline, while not used a lot , were very helpful when they were used. The tripod was really helpful, it had a little bluetooth remote and we were able to take some really good pics when there was no one else around. Using it as a selfie stick, while goofy, was also very helpful. I really liked the bag but I wish it was just a few points bigger. My rain shell was the bane of my packing system.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1c1mdah/40_days_europe_top_to_bottom_and_texas/",
        "selftext": "So, like many here, I have scoured this sub and learned a lot from the posts here. The biggest take away from me was to ‚Äòuse what you‚Äôve got‚Äô. So that‚Äôs what I ended up doing. I have a [Standard Luggage 35L](https://www.standardluggage.com/products/carry-on-backpack-travel-bag) and an [eBags Professional Weekender](https://youtu.be/VFTEEWTsIoA?si=Sc_hY_utc4oIYBXe) that they don‚Äôt make anymore.\n\nAfter looking at Copaxi and Nomadic and Osprey etc and withering under analysis paralysis, I ended up just using the Weekender that I already owned. It‚Äôs not the perfect bag but I like it a lot. I use another smaller  eBag as my daily carry so I‚Äôm real comfortable with how it wears. For instance there‚Äôs a grab handle on one side and I reflexively slide the bag off that side and grab this handle. They also have a feature they call a ‚Äògarage‚Äô which is a semi rigid container that sits on the bottom of the bag. I used another one from my other bag so that I had two on this trip. One for tech stuff and one for toiletries.\n\nOur journey led us from the Scottish Highlands to the beach in Athens and finally to Northern Texas so it was challenging for us to have a versatile wardrobe. In the end, I used every piece of clothing I had and enjoyed having the flexibility it provided.\n\nI took cotton because I owned it and I couldn‚Äôt come to terms with spending so much on merino products. I wore clean t-shirt/socks/underwear almost everyday (there were a couple of travel days where I might rewear a tshirt). This meant we were visiting laundry mats or sink washing frequently. It was all part of the adventure. There were a couple days in Rome where we put on some serious walking and my socks got funky and I wished I did have merino. \n\nI did not one bag in the strictest sense. I carried a cheap collapsible backpack that folds up to the size of my fist. This was probably one of the most important things we took with us. We used it for day hikes, grocery shopping, laundry days etc. I also carried a slim sling for my super important stuff and some pocket things (extra headphones, tissues).\n\nThoughts/lessons learned: I wish I would have had a more robust battery system. I liked the MagSafe battery but it only gave my phone about half a charge and I couldn‚Äôt use it for any of my other devices. The duct tape and clothesline, while not used a lot , were very helpful when they were used. The tripod was really helpful, it had a little bluetooth remote and we were able to take some really good pics when there was no one else around. Using it as a selfie stick, while goofy, was also very helpful. I really liked the bag but I wish it was just a few points bigger. My rain shell was the bane of my packing system. It took up a lot of space and I only used it a few times in Scotland. It was the reason my bag felt overstuffed. I don‚Äôt know how to improve that part. I packed a disposable poncho that I never needed and wouldn‚Äôt bring again (not shown). My system would have worked a lot better in a warm climate. Binoculars were also a fail. I would constantly forget them and they took a lot of space in the tech pouch. Never used the earplugs or the masks but I would pack them again in the future.\n \n\nPacking List:\n\nPic 1\nMinix 66w GaN charger\nUK and EU adapters (grey pouch)\nElectric clippers (one charge lasts me about two months so no cord)\nContact solution\nShaving cream\nBody wash\nPocket first aid kit\nLotion\nScreen wipes\nPrescription glasses and case, contact case\nLoofah\nPaper copies of passports, ID, and emergency phone numbers (embassies and hotels and home numbers), insurance info\nDeodorant\nEar plugs\n12 weeks worth of contacts\nChapstick\n12‚Äù iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard\nTheta 360 camera\nNikon point and shoot (extra battery so no cord)\nAir rage for backpack\nPen, Apple Pencil\nOld sfbags.com phone case leather pouch used for cords and spare credit cards\n2 x USB-C to USB-C, 1 x USB-C to lightning (for headphones), 1 x USB-C short Apple Watch Charger\nSpare mask\nSpork\nMini duct tape\nFloss\nTissue\nToothbrush\nBinoculars\nMagSafe battery (Mophie I think)\nBackup battery (did not take due to space)\n7 way USB-C dongle (for the Nikon)\nAir Pod Max headphones\n(Mini clothes line not shown)\n\nPic 2\n3 x Cotton T shirts black\n1 x Cotton T shirt white (not shown)\n5 X Cotton Underwear (1 worn)\n3 X Cotton Ankle Socks (grey ones in pic not taken for space)\n2 X Cotton Tube Socks (1 worn, not shown)\nButton up flannel.

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI‚Äôm deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y‚Äôall about it! Some preface: I don‚Äôt consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should‚Äôve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let‚Äôs get into the bag now that we know what‚Äôs in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don‚Äôt think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn‚Äôt even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they‚Äôre SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it‚Äôs comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren‚Äôt bad. They won‚Äôt hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I‚Äôve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it‚Äôs great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn‚Äôt even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they‚Äôre SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it‚Äôs comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren‚Äôt bad. They won‚Äôt hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I‚Äôve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it‚Äôs great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI‚Äôm deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y‚Äôall about it! Some preface: I don‚Äôt consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should‚Äôve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let‚Äôs get into the bag now that we know what‚Äôs in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don‚Äôt think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn‚Äôt even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they‚Äôre SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it‚Äôs comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren‚Äôt bad. They won‚Äôt hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I‚Äôve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it‚Äôs great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/12lqrce/osprey_266_a_brief_review/",
        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI‚Äôm deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y‚Äôall about it! Some preface: I don‚Äôt consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should‚Äôve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let‚Äôs get into the bag now that we know what‚Äôs in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don‚Äôt think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn‚Äôt even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they‚Äôre SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it‚Äôs comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren‚Äôt bad. They won‚Äôt hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I‚Äôve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it‚Äôs great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

I‚Äôm a frequent 1-2 night work traveler and so my usual combo is a carry-on and backpack.  Because I‚Äôm on the move quite a bit, accessing the backpack top-down or vertically is very important - either while it‚Äôs on top of my carry-on or from in between my feet while in flight.\n\nThe EBag seems to function best while on its belly due to the half zip style and its very narrow design. It behaves quite front-heavy and the low trolley strap also worsens this characteristic.  A few times my carry-on + EBag combo almost fell over while I was in transit.  After reading a few more reviews on EBag website, apparently the design was changed without much marketing or publicity about the change.  \n\nIn the end EBag refunded me the entire amount.  Hope this serves as a useful review for someone in the future.  \n\nI remain on the hunt!",

And the shaving soap I used for shaving. \n\nThe shaving soap turned out to be extremely useful. We met up with some family in Austria and I was given a jar of homemade blueberry jam to bring home to family in America. Well the first night it ended up leaking in my bag and got all over my merino wool dress shirt. I was able to use the shaving soap as a spot treatment and completely removed the large stain.\n\nIn the end I could have gotten away with leaving the extra bar and the extra shaving soap at home. Currently I'm considering even replacing the shaving soap with the bar soap. So in the future I'll probably bring a single bar of Bronner's and the small bottle of liquid Bronner's.",

We have some family in Austria and there were a few American products they wanted, so I brought them over in my bag. Also, before we left Europe we went on a chocolate shopping spree and so my bag was crammed full on the way back. The expandable zipper helps a lot with this. But you can also tighten the straps on the side and make it very compact if you want.\n\nThe other nice thing is that the bag opens like a suitcase, so it's very easy to find what you want quickly. It also converts so that you can carry it like a backpack or like a briefcase. The only problem I have with the bag is that the waist strap is insubstantial. It works, but it doesn't have any padding. Although it may be possible to swap in a better waist strap if you want.\n\nThe compartments and pockets are also very well thought out. There is laptop area near your back \\(although I didn't bring one\\). There's small compartment on the top that is very useful for chargers, earbuds and other things that you might want to access quickly. There's the zippered compartment on the exterior that is really useful for passports, train passes, maps and other flat objects. \n\nThere is also a waterbottle holders that pulls out, but it's more suited for small bottles like disposable water bottles. It's a bit too narrow for Nalgene bottle sizes. It works fine for my Vapur bottle, but I typically just clip it on or put it in one of the main compartments. I ended up using the water bottle compartment for holding all of the coins that we accumulated.\n\nNow the only bags I use for any trip length is this one and the Sea to Summit day pack. I even use this bag for work as it looks professional and can cinch down to the size of a briefcase.",

                "body": "I had one and didn't care for it.  My main complaints:\n\n1. It was hard to pack the main area.  Because it's soft sided and the front half is heavy and kind of rigid, the main area walls would always collapse as you were putting stuff in it.  I'd end up just half-filling it, zipping it and the filling it from the top, which would defeat my clothes organization attempts and make it kinda lumpy.  For similar reasons, it was also tough to just get one thing out of the main area and re-close it\n2. It was uncomfortable to wear.  The shoulder straps were thin for a bag that gets heavy, there was no waist strap, and no attempt to make the back breathable.  It constantly felt like it was pulling me backward and chafing on my shoulders.  The shoulder strap was more convenient for putting down/picking up, but even less comfortable.  I would almost always be sore somewhere after wearing it for any length of time\n3. The laptop area felt unsafe for laptops.  When the main area was full, it would make the laptop compartment bulge outward.  I never felt comfortable putting my laptop in there and would end up packing it in the front instead.\n4. Kind of a side issue, but I found the level of marketing email eBags sent after buying it extremely annoying.  Even after I unsubscribed from marketing emails,  I'd get these \"we gave you a new coupon/some points because we haven't heard from you\" and then \"Your points are expiring\" emails that were obviously just end-runs.  I finally started marking them as spam.\n\nOn the good side, it was tough, I got it for ~$65 (although for an ugly brown color) which felt like a good deal, the luggage tag pocket and the top pocket were great ideas, and the well-placed handles made it easy to stuff into and remove from various racks and compartments.  If you're interested, you may also want to look at something like the AmazonBasics Carry-On Travel Bag, which looked like a slightly simpler, cheaper knockoff of this.",

From 40L 2 years ago to 35L last year to this 30 L. Main features:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvzqfsvzekse1.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83a44abd622837e2ee96fb05cce5015c3e8faa69\n\n* Two external quick access zip pockets (you can see one with sunglass and the other with map in this pic). The top one has two non-zip internal pockets too and a key/lanyard hook\n* Dedicated chamber at the bottom, which I use to store snacks, waterproof toiletry pouch etc. One can store dirty clothes there, or extra footwear.\n* The main compartment is very spacious; two fully packed packing cubes can easily fit in with space to spare. I love the slotted zip design of main compartment instead of the suitcase style. Slanted zipper allows quick retrieval of packing cubes from the bag and no need to find a flat surface to open.\n* Bungee cord system (elastic webbing) in front is a huge plus; I use it to store wet towel, rain jacket etc\n* Triangular Clip attachment strip in front (not visible in image as this area is where the bag flap is folded); for attaching [rechargeable USB light](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8560549/cycling-light-rear-usb-cl100) while riding bike/walking in night etc\n* Chest and Hip straps\n* Dual zips are super smooth, but not YKK.\n* Additional zippered Internal secure pocket in main compartment to store essentials\n* Hydration Bladder compatible; bladder compartment has thick padding/cushioning suitable for laptop too.\n* External loops for hiking pole\n* Reflective loops in shoulder straps\n* Two bottle cages with deep pockets and straps that absolutely secures my 1.5L Nalgene Everyday Wide Mouth X 2 bottles on either side. The bottle straps also act as compression straps for the bag, so even when fully packed, the bag won't bulge out, an important aesthetic feature I really like.\n* The back panel is thickly padded with excellent ventillation\n* Dimensions passable as an under-seat laptop bag for budget EU/Asian airlines\n* Very inexpensive and very high volume to gram ratio (30L for 815g)\n* Sustainability: Decathlon offers repair service for this bag in their stores.\n\nWish future iterations of this bag offer:\n\n* Lockable zip (for hostel stays, for instance)\n* Padded hip belt. The current one is very basic\n* More reflective elements in front of the bag\n* Water resistance; but please, no PFOA/PFOS treatment. I use a waterproof cover, and its fine, too.",

All I carry in it is my laptop and wallet, and always use both straps, and the leather tore by the shoulder strap hardware less than two months after purchase - and I only carried it 3 days a week! They only warranty the product for 30 days and their customer support told me I was simply out of luck on a $350 bag. Love the look but that kind of price deserves a higher quality product and a company that stands behind it‚Ä¶$10/wear before tearing is just unacceptable.",

They have a handful of sizes, colors, and materials/finishes and their bags are usually convertible. This one is a backpack, cross body or top handle. I would use this one because you can wear as a backpack to commute, but easily switch to the top handle or crossbody walking into an important meeting where maybe a backpack would feel too informal. \n\nSenreve also has sales and can be found on some sites for cheaper! MMLafleur has it for around 600 in a light yellow right now. There‚Äôs a few on Poshmark around that price also. Just be certain to check the dimensions / specs if buying on other sites since it does come in multiple sizes and materials.\n\nEdited to add-  I have the smallest version of this bag - it‚Äôs convertible between a crossbody/shoulder length and a bum bag. I love it!",

I use this bag every single day I go to work, and it's really awesome for work trips and traveling. I have had mine 1.5 years now and it's held up super well despite my daily abuse. If anyone is on the fence, I just want to echo that it's totally worth it. I do use it as a backpack when I am commuting and it's great. I also love the laptop pocket and I do not find it too heavy with my computer in there. I also have the pebbled leather.",
