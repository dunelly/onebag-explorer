        "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

If it fits properly, then it’s a viable choice for you. From there it’s mostly personal preference on the feature set. \n\nInventories have been wonky industry wide since Covid and travel has gone from 0-60. \n\n\nCheck out the new REI Trail 40.

The carry system on the Osprey is unmatched and we really felt it on walks even five minutes or more. The packing organization on the border is way better BUT it can make you feel like you can pack more than you should since the pack gets fat and the weight just gets further from your back and the bag even less ergonomic. If you carry less than 7 kg than the border is awesome! But any more weight and the Osprey becomes the winner.",

The Gregory Border can be found in black for $189 on a handful of sites. I wasn't thrilled about the black, but saw that a site in the Netherlands called outdoorxl had the brown on sale.  After shipping (which only took 3 days!), the bag was about $209, so I figured what's $20 more if I like it better and it will last a long time.  Both bags used to be available in more colors.  The fact that they haven't been restocked online makes me wonder if a new model will be coming out in the near future.",

        "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

        "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

Then just attach that male part to the pack you want to attach in front. Of course you can use whatever size mates up, but my pack has 3/4\" webbing. Unfortunately the old 15L Farpoint bag does not fit the new Farpoint either, I think that is a much better day pack. I attached both ways in photo just for demonstration. Both are super simple.  I have reached out to Osprey and asked for the clips so I can just use on my old Day pack and hopefully they send them. I also will take the male clips and make them removable - maybe te to a carabiner so I can front attach any pack, or a sling, camera case, etc - using these \"universal\" female clips now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8e33n98romee1.jpeg?width=2992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1559bcd5e5fbb3dc3077c594ba34f5d7eb11eb0b",

This is helpful because not all materials to reach true black and many people don’t color vision accurate enough to pick up on a tint. But it’s very frustrating for those who do lol\n\nOverall it’s a curious technical/color theory trick, but Osprey’s naming is confusing and I wish they had “Osprey’s grey” in default color range than “Osprey’s black”",

                "body": "Black has many tones to it as any other color, but linguistically they’re all mashed together as “black”. \nLooking at grey Osprey, I think, anyone would say it’s black, just not super dark deep black. \nAdding another color (usually blue, red or magenta) to black makes it appear darker, while technically being the same level of black. This is helpful because not all materials to reach true black and many people don’t color vision accurate enough to pick up on a tint. But it’s very frustrating for those who do lol\n\nOverall it’s a curious technical/color theory trick, but Osprey’s naming is confusing and I wish they had “Osprey’s grey” in default color range than “Osprey’s black”",

            "body": "Hello fellow r/onebag'ers\n\n^((made a new post for better readability and with gear links))\n\nI'd like to share my recent expedition through Southeast Asia (SEA), where my partner and I embarked on a 6-month escapade. We seized the opportunity when my work granted me unpaid leave, and my partner took a leap of faith, leaving her job to pursue further studies. Our voyage unfolded in the vast landscapes of SEA.  Our journey commenced on February 28th, 2023, departing from Zurich and landing in bustling Bangkok. Our explorations took us across diverse territories: 45 days in Thailand, 31 days in Laos, 20 days in Cambodia, 30 days in Vietnam and a memorable 29 days in Indonesia. We then retraced our steps, with a final stop in Bangkok before heading home via Istanbul on August 1st.  To visually depict it, I created a video of our route and marked the most important points of interest on Maps.\n\n[Visualized route on youtube](https://youtu.be/0r6YJ166URc)\n\n[Google maps marked POIs](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1KS09_RVsvA1QPE4SsbqsF2WPIaTGXTQ&amp;ll=13.994912470354683%2C65.73922297500003&amp;z=4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the backpack of my choice – or rather the backpack I had on hand (because I had bought it for the Camino de Santiago, which I never ended up doing) – it was the Osprey Farpoint 40. My partner had the Quechua Escape 50L. Given the size of her backpack and its weight, we were aware that it would never pass as carry-on, and if necessary, we could transfer a few things from my backpack to hers to avoid having to check in both backpacks. My plan was to travel with carry-on only, but it wasn't as important to her – this was her smallest backpack so far; she had previously traveled with a 70L backpack, xD.  [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/116gk53/first_time_onebaging_6_months_se_asia/) my Reddit post before departure with my initial packing list. There are a few changes that were made, so here's my actual packing list of what I ended up taking:\n\n^((sorry had to split b/c of 10000 chars))\n\nEdit:\n\n....and yes, it's a shame i don't have more pictures of the backpack on the trip :(",

Slimmer hip straps, stuff pocket on the front, added loops for attaching things. There’re also clips on the shoulder straps to attach a daypack, which you could order a clip for and fashion a detachable bottle system. \n\nRegarding restraint to not fill the space because you have it… I can’t help you there buddy 🤣\n\nOne thing I’ll say is that always having some extra space is a benefit for those unforeseen moments… Last year I went from 36degree warm to -5 cold within a few days and needed to buy some cold weather gear, but didn’t want to shed anything I was carrying… the extra space was essential for that last leg.\n\nGlad you had a great trip and thanks for taking the time for the write up.\n\nBe well.",

            "body": "Hello fellow r/onebag'ers\n\n^((made a new post for better readability and with gear links))\n\nI'd like to share my recent expedition through Southeast Asia (SEA), where my partner and I embarked on a 6-month escapade. We seized the opportunity when my work granted me unpaid leave, and my partner took a leap of faith, leaving her job to pursue further studies. Our voyage unfolded in the vast landscapes of SEA.  Our journey commenced on February 28th, 2023, departing from Zurich and landing in bustling Bangkok. Our explorations took us across diverse territories: 45 days in Thailand, 31 days in Laos, 20 days in Cambodia, 30 days in Vietnam and a memorable 29 days in Indonesia. We then retraced our steps, with a final stop in Bangkok before heading home via Istanbul on August 1st.  To visually depict it, I created a video of our route and marked the most important points of interest on Maps.\n\n[Visualized route on youtube](https://youtu.be/0r6YJ166URc)\n\n[Google maps marked POIs](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1KS09_RVsvA1QPE4SsbqsF2WPIaTGXTQ&amp;ll=13.994912470354683%2C65.73922297500003&amp;z=4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the backpack of my choice – or rather the backpack I had on hand (because I had bought it for the Camino de Santiago, which I never ended up doing) – it was the Osprey Farpoint 40. My partner had the Quechua Escape 50L. Given the size of her backpack and its weight, we were aware that it would never pass as carry-on, and if necessary, we could transfer a few things from my backpack to hers to avoid having to check in both backpacks. My plan was to travel with carry-on only, but it wasn't as important to her – this was her smallest backpack so far; she had previously traveled with a 70L backpack, xD.  [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/116gk53/first_time_onebaging_6_months_se_asia/) my Reddit post before departure with my initial packing list. There are a few changes that were made, so here's my actual packing list of what I ended up taking:\n\n^((sorry had to split b/c of 10000 chars))\n\nEdit:\n\n....and yes, it's a shame i don't have more pictures of the backpack on the trip :(",

            "body": "I'm getting ready for a couple overseas and domestic trips in the next few months. I've been looking for a suitable bag to meet my needs, which lead me to the selection of either the Eagle Creek Tour 40L or the popular Osprey Farpoint 40L. Both fit within my criteria of quality bags at the same exact price point with lifetime warranties, along with various other desirable traits.\n\nFor this comparison, I will mostly be adding pictures of the Eagle Creek as it is a newer bag with not a lot of information out there. Hopefully it can help people make up their decisions.\n\n**Internal Structure:**\n\nBoth Eagle Creek and Farpoint comes with a book (clam) style opening with easy access to the internals. Whereas the Farpoint 40L opens from top to bottom, and the EC opens up at from right to left. The Farpoint comes with a nice bright green high visibility interior, while the Eagle Creek is just black. Although on the EC it varies depending on the color you choose.\n\n[Comparison side by side](https://imgur.com/hYmY1NQ)\n\nIn terms of internal organization, both are very similar in terms of sizing. Both also come with internal clips. Here is a image where I quickly stuff the bag with a fully loaded EC Medium and Small packing cube, Marmot Precip, and 7 pairs of socks. Also in the internal pocket is an REI Co-op Flash 18L with my bladder, and 1 quart bag with toiletries.\n\n[Farpoint - Interior Loaded Up](https://imgur.com/3Gglzpm)\n\n[EC - Interior Loaded Up](https://imgur.com/SRbxE5P)\n\n**Size and Measurements:**\n\nBoth are rated at 40L, and I would say the measurement dimensions provided by both Farpoint and EC on their websites are correct. Although, in terms of capacity it seems the Farpoint can definitely hold more due to the outside pockets.\n\n[Picture of both bags side by side fully stuffed with clothes and towels](https://imgur.com/h4bb0VS)\n\nThe EC comes with a single side water bottle pouch, while the Farpoint comes with two back water bottle pouches. The EC bottle pouch seems to hold more. Here is an [image of the Farpoint](https://imgur.com/SiCa8lj) and [EC](https://imgur.com/wtWvdzQ) using my 18 oz Hydroflask. Not a fan of the Farpoint water bottle holders on the back, but not a dealbreaker.\n\nThe EC has the capability to expand to 43L according to the outside tag. I feel once you unzip the bag to provide the expanded capacity their sizes are more evenly matched.\n\n**Shoulder straps, hip belt, and sternum strap:**\n\nBoth come with a foam shoulder straps. The Farpoint shoulder straps are a bit wider, but the edgeless design on the EC make carrying the bag much more comfortable, at least for me. Also the EC has a more pronounced S curve as compared to the Farpoint which adds to the overall comfortable.\n\nBoth bags come with a sternum strap with a built in whistle. Although the EC is a stretchy material versus the Farpoint non-stretchy.\n\n[Side by side view](https://imgur.com/RREsfSN)\n\nThe Farpoint's hip belt is much better and provides more surface and cushion to wrap around your body. The straps are also wider than the 1 inch straps of the EC. The EC hip strap is pretty thin in comparison, but is also stowable which the Farpoint is not.\n\n[Image side by side](https://imgur.com/W8Nu6YB)\n\n[Hipbelt side by side](https://imgur.com/IP4zISJ)\n\nI also like to mention both bags have the ability to stow away the straps. The Farpoint has a wrap which can cover the shoulder and hip straps. The EC also has a type of strap and waist belt [cover](https://imgur.com/NVhO47V), but it also doubles as a [rain cover](https://imgur.com/lyNHOiR)! The EC also has an adjustable yoke that is secured to the back padded area using velcro.\n\n**External Features:**\n\nBoth the EC and Farpoint come with a top handle and side handle. [The Farpoint](https://imgur.com/SD0gIIX) handles are larger and have more cushion, but the [EC](https://imgur.com/mL4QUm1) is adequate in terms of sizing.\n\n[Side Handles](https://imgur.com/mhlGFf7)\n\nFarpoint has a one large external pocket with a laptop organizer which sits in the back, so it sits to the outside of the bag. Apparently a lot of people hate this feature, but I don't plan on carrying a laptop.\n\nEC has two minimalist pockets on the [outside](https://imgur.com/s0ZR9T0) with no organization. The bottom pocket does have a key leash. EC bag is the traditional laptop organization near the back of the bag with a side opening zipper. \n\nSpeaking of the [zippers](https://imgur.com/5dr1CF3), the Farpoint uses a larger YKK zipper and EC uses their own brand of zippers. I don't know why, but I expected the Farpoint zippers to be much smoother. It was quite the opposite, I found the EC to be smoother and easier to open. Opening the Farpoint was a bit of a pain, as the rain cover would often add resistance to the pulling of the zippers.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nYMMV! Everyone's body is ***DIFFERENT***. I got the M/L torso size for both bags as their respective sizing seem to match my body type. For this I thought the Farpoint would have been the clear winner here, but surprisingly I found the Eagle Creek to be much more comfortable even with the puny waist strap. Both bags seem to sit on my hip shelf well, but the [back lower padding](https://imgur.com/vJOMX5N) of the EC adds a lot of comfortable to my lower back. I feel the Farpoint adds more strain on my lower back over longer periods of time. I tested this by wearing the bag for about an hour or so.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAnyway, I hope this helps anyone out consider either of these two bags.  I'm about to put in my Amazon return, as I've tested these bags for a month now. In you are wondering, I am picking the Eagle Creek Tour 40L. But that is just my preference in terms of comfortable, organization, and aesthetic. Both bags are not perfect, but I feel more comfortable with the Eagle Creek. If I could just combine the high visibility interior and waist belt of the Farpoint with the Eagle Creek, it would have been near perfect.",

Overall, I feel like the space of both backpacks is fairly similar (again maybe slightly smaller), but you get better organization in the CTB35. I like it a lot!",

However, I always felt like filling up the farpoint made the front pocket useless. With this one the main compartment may be smaller, but the other compartments are more useful. I can say more about it after next week's trip, because I will fly with the bag as a carry on, and it is going to be completely filled!",

The dimensions published on the Kathmandu site are 57 cm x 33 cm L x W 25 cm. If that’s correct, it’s oversized on length for many airlines. \n\nI would try both on for fit and check the dimensions against the airlines you plan on using. Check weight limits too.
