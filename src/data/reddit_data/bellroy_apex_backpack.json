At best I'll have a cheaper imitation, at worst I'll have a knockoff sling good for the carboot.\n\nBut I'm shocked at how similar they are, other than the tag being in Chinese I would have struggled seeing which is the real one. So I'm not sure if it even is a knockoff or not. ",

I’ve been to factories in Bangladesh and China where they’re simultaneously running lines for YKK and unbranded products. Maybe in some cases they use a lower quality substrate from recycled materials in the process for the generics but even that is usually not even worth the effort.",

            "body": "My new Bellroy Apex arrived on the front porch yesterday, so I thought I would post some initial impressions for you guys (and gals).\n\n**WHAT MAKES THIS BAG SPECIAL?**\n\n**MATERIALS:** the textile that Bellroy has chosen to build this bag is simply the nicest feeling bag material I have ever handled. It is firm enough to hold its shape and give the bag structure but is not rough in any way. It is smooth and dense without a hint of grit and has a very unique surface texture. It feels absolutely fantastic in the hand.\n\n**COMFORT:** I am 5’10” and the bag is one of (if not the) most comfortable bags in my collection. The back panel is curved in such a way that it fits my spine perfectly and distributes the weight evenly across my back. The bottom of the pack curves gently away to eliminate hot spots on the lower back and the shoulder straps are soft and pliable. They are wide enough to bear a decent amount of weight, but flexible enough to conform perfectly to the shoulder…no break-in period required. I am impressed with the simplicity and comfort of this system.\n\n**LAYOUT:** the accessibility of the inside compartment, the unique latching system, the magnets, the stretchy pockets and convenient quick-access pockets work well for my current EDC load out.\n\n**COLOR:** oftentimes, I will hesitate to order a new bag because I have trouble choosing the “best” color. Bellroy has simplified the ordering process by only offering one color and it is spectacular. In dark lighting conditions, the pack can appear almost charcoal grey, but in the daylight, the bag has a beautiful smoky dark blue hue that is perfect. The tan leather trim on the lid and the bright-colored interior are tasteful. The salmon color chosen for the interior of the quick access pockets gives a pop of color without grabbing too much attention…everything just works.\n\n**WHAT IS SUB-OPTIMAL?**\n\nThe thin leather top handle is the one touch point that (on my particular bag) is not up to par with everything else. The leather that Bellroy has chosen has a dry, rough texture on the underside so it doesn’t feel premium in the hand, especially when compared to the rest of the materials ([https://i.imgur.com/DxdgSFD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DxdgSFD.jpg))\n\nEven more concerning, unlike the tapered leather ends of the shoulder straps that have been reinforced with heavy-duty nylon webbing to prevent stretching ([https://i.imgur.com/Y02ai0t.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Y02ai0t.jpg)), there are no reinforcements on the top handle. It is a single layer of leather (slightly thinner than I would prefer) attached with two bar tacks on each side, but due to the thinness of the leather and the lack of support, I am concerned about stretching and longevity over time with heavier loads.\n\n**WHAT IS DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED?**\n\nWhen I first unpacked the bag, I was immediately struck by how tiny and thin the sternum strap is ([https://i.imgur.com/gFVnGmm.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/gFVnGmm.jpg)). It feels very small and takes a bit of practice to smoothly fasten it. At first, I thought, the clasp and strap were just not good choices for the size/design of the bag…they are downright dainty. However, after wearing it around the house, I quickly warmed up to it and the simplicity and function just seem to work. It is one of those cases where simpler is better.\n\n**CONCLUSION: IS IT WORTH THE PRICE?**\n\nWhether or not something is “worth” the cost is completely subjective and based on many factors, but the quality material choices (especially the unique outer textile), the way the bag feels when you interact with it, the unique layout and the comfort of the straps justifies the price for me. Do I think the bag would be a better value in the $325-$375 price range? Sure. However, I am not contemplating returning it, so in the end, it is “worth it” to me.\n\nI will follow up with a full review in a few weeks…please feel free to ask any questions you may have…thanks!",

Everything from the materials, straps, even the slide hook mechanism was perfect (too tight on the apex, WAY TOO loose on the Chimera). Only wish it kept the water resistant material in the water bottle pocket like the Chimera.\n\nIMO, it's not as beautiful as the Apex but I feel like it's the perfect fusion of the Apex and PD backpack, and that works for me.\n\nWill prob be selling the Apex, will def be selling the Chimera.",

            "body": "Ok ok ok... \n\nWhen this was announced, I absolutely hated it. The price, vagueness of materials, the weird marketing that wasn't unlike anything Bellroy- I just flat out didn't like the bag.\n\nFast forward a few days and I couldn't get my mind off that gorgeous Onyx colour. It reminds me of some volcanic stones I saw by the sea a few years back. Not quite black, not quite grey- but somewhere in between.\n\nSo I bit the bullet. $749 NZD ($450ish USD)  plus shipping and it was at my doorstep in less than 24 hours. Pretty impressive given it came from another country in the midst of a global pandemic.\n\nI will take some better photos tomorrow but first impressions are:\n\n1. It isn't as big as I thought it would be. Not a bad thing but 25L is pretty much my limit for EDC- anything larger then I am probably going to pick up a duffle or weekender.  The dimensions, especially width, make it look really wide but I see now that they measured at the very top of the bag where the flap folds. The body is a more manageable size.\n2. It's quite lightweight. I just thought it would be quite heavy given all the leather used and aluminium hardware but it's not bad at all. It isn't featherlight but I wouldn't call it obnoxiously heavy as something from Filson.\n3. Aesthetics wise, I think it's a good match. It doesn't look too heritage like a Filson, doesn't look too futuristic like a Peak Design, it's not military inspired like a GoRuck or Wandrd, nor is it leaning too much towards sleek streetwear like you'd get from AER or DSPTCH. I think this wouldn't look out of place while travelling with a technical lightweight jacket or heading down to a friend's house in a white shirt and jeans.\n\nI'm not sure if I will end up keeping this yet since hey it's a lot of money but for the moment I really am impressed. It's nowhere near worth the asking price but it is definitely a step above my other Bellroy stuff.",

If I have a water bottle in one of the internal side pockets and a pouch in the other (combined with the floppiness) it’s so hard getting simple things in and out of the bag. \n\nThe chimera is just a huge miss. As you said, cramped space esp with a water bottle and the slide hook just won’t stay, popping out constantly. I would not feel comfortable storing that in the overhead bin on an airplane. \n\nThe venture also has its problems which ultimately made me return it. The back panel is so hot, esp right now during the summer. It feels like I’m putting a heated blanket on my back. I dont have this problem with the peak design edb. Also the shoulder straps loosen under heavy loads. Shame.. I felt like this one would be able to replace my PD EDB.",

The water bottle inside is a mixed feelings situation. I do not like to have the water bottles hanging outside any bag, but having it together with the electronics you are adding is a risk factor for as much as one gets good quality bottles.\n\nWith the PD bags, I dislike their laptop implementation. Especially if you want to have a tablet as well. It feels so tight. Every time my wife uses her PD travel bag and I feel that the laptop would break from being so pressured. \n\nWith that said, I have tried many different ones, being the chimera, GR1 Heritage, GR1 slick, DB Aera, Wandrd Duo and prvke, some Picard leather, Thule crossover, another one from Samsonite, PD tote backpack, Black Ember Forge, QWSTION daypack and simple office.  I always came back to the Apex. \n\nIn the end, the bottles stay a bit lower than the laptop, and the laptop is two layers away from the eventual spills so that I can live with it. The major \"issue\" for me is that eventually, the bag is much bigger and has much more capacity than I actually need. But the search never ends. Maybe I will try a BE Citadel next; I am curious to see how \"boxy\" it would look on my back. I like the look of the materials and the clean aesthetics.  \n\nMy wife always says that at least it is not drugs or gaming addiction so that she can handle these packages coming and going and my build-up of arguments for the next one. She already makes fun of me by trying to guess what will be a \"problem/shortcoming\" that I will complain about in the next bag.",

The mechanism on mine is flawless, and can even be done with one hand.\n\nAlso, the loops are made from leather, and straight out the box are stiffer than usual like every leather product ever. Mine broke in after a day or two and I haven't had a single bit of trouble with it since.\n\nI get that it's an expensive product, but the people in this thread saying \"don't buy Bellroy ever\" are extremely misguided. They make some fantastic products, that just like every brand ever, aren't for everyone. I personally love the brand and think any carry enthusiast who is a fan of good design should give them a go.",

Seems like it's nothing more than an ego thing by Bellroy and their designer- which is surprising given the bags I own from them have been very utilitarian and minimalist, with a dash of creativity. \n\nThis seems like they are going after the luxury Nomin market. GoRuck is doing it, The Brown Buffalo is doing it, and now Bellroy did it.\n\nI was hoping that price was a typo since that is absolutely insane for a Vietnam made bag with a three year warranty.",
