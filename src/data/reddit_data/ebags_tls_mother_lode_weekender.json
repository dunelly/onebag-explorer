        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1fxlhww/thule_construct_24l_review_the_good_and_the_bad/",
        "selftext": "Needed a laptop/EDC bag to replace my Boblebe 25L Megalopolis and chose Thule Construct 24L in Midnight Blue. \n\nBLUF: Gorgeous and super comfortable laptop bag with a couple design flaws. \n\nLike:\n- Gorgeous color-ways. Inside is a light blue that contrasts to the exterior which is a heathered midnight blue.\n\n- Super comfortable. straps and back padding is a soft cushion with mesh for airflow\n\n- Buckles and zippers are a mix of Satin aluminum S buckles, heat shrink zipper pulls but not waterproof \n\n- Quick access pouch is soft and padded but could be bigger \n\n- 2 Water bottle pockets are massive and have stretch fabric that expands. Holds larger pouches and any size water bottle I’ve tried up to a 50 ounce camelback. Crazy talk.\n\n- Separate laptop and tablet compartments are soft with lots of padding. \n\nDislike:\n\n- Front admin pouch only zips down about 3 inches so hard to get items\n- Carrying handle is attached to the top of the straps, which is awkward\n- only one pouch (mesh) inside main compartment. \n- laptop compartment is not suspended, but the tablet compartment is. WTF.\n\nRATING: 1-10\nComfortability: 9\nForm: 9 \nFunction: 7\nValue: 9 \nAccessibility: 6.5\n\n\nIf you add a couple modifications, this is really a great bag. I added a vinyl bumper to the bottom of the laptop bag, and a sternum strap. \n\nThe stash pocket behind the front admin area is lashed on with two satin nickel S buckles and expands a little with mesh fabric. It’s holding my Fostex headphones, which are pretty big. \n\nThe Thule crossover organizer it came with is a little rigid but holds all my cables and battery charger. Also comes with a smaller secondary pouch inside thats magnetically fastened to the bottom, which can hold your passport, some cards and some cash. \n\nFor a work laptop bag it’s awesome, probably not so much for expanded EDC purposes. Looking at Evergood or able carry for an EDC currently. ",

                "body": "I personally love it. It's the perfect size for me. Although I could probably use a smaller bag, the extra room ended up being very valuable. We have some family in Austria and there were a few American products they wanted, so I brought them over in my bag. Also, before we left Europe we went on a chocolate shopping spree and so my bag was crammed full on the way back. The expandable zipper helps a lot with this. But you can also tighten the straps on the side and make it very compact if you want.\n\nThe other nice thing is that the bag opens like a suitcase, so it's very easy to find what you want quickly. It also converts so that you can carry it like a backpack or like a briefcase. The only problem I have with the bag is that the waist strap is insubstantial. It works, but it doesn't have any padding. Although it may be possible to swap in a better waist strap if you want.\n\nThe compartments and pockets are also very well thought out. There is laptop area near your back \\(although I didn't bring one\\). There's small compartment on the top that is very useful for chargers, earbuds and other things that you might want to access quickly. There's the zippered compartment on the exterior that is really useful for passports, train passes, maps and other flat objects. \n\nThere is also a waterbottle holders that pulls out, but it's more suited for small bottles like disposable water bottles. It's a bit too narrow for Nalgene bottle sizes. It works fine for my Vapur bottle, but I typically just clip it on or put it in one of the main compartments. I ended up using the water bottle compartment for holding all of the coins that we accumulated.\n\nNow the only bags I use for any trip length is this one and the Sea to Summit day pack. I even use this bag for work as it looks professional and can cinch down to the size of a briefcase.",

                "body": "I had one and didn't care for it.  My main complaints:\n\n1. It was hard to pack the main area.  Because it's soft sided and the front half is heavy and kind of rigid, the main area walls would always collapse as you were putting stuff in it.  I'd end up just half-filling it, zipping it and the filling it from the top, which would defeat my clothes organization attempts and make it kinda lumpy.  For similar reasons, it was also tough to just get one thing out of the main area and re-close it\n2. It was uncomfortable to wear.  The shoulder straps were thin for a bag that gets heavy, there was no waist strap, and no attempt to make the back breathable.  It constantly felt like it was pulling me backward and chafing on my shoulders.  The shoulder strap was more convenient for putting down/picking up, but even less comfortable.  I would almost always be sore somewhere after wearing it for any length of time\n3. The laptop area felt unsafe for laptops.  When the main area was full, it would make the laptop compartment bulge outward.  I never felt comfortable putting my laptop in there and would end up packing it in the front instead.\n4. Kind of a side issue, but I found the level of marketing email eBags sent after buying it extremely annoying.  Even after I unsubscribed from marketing emails,  I'd get these \"we gave you a new coupon/some points because we haven't heard from you\" and then \"Your points are expiring\" emails that were obviously just end-runs.  I finally started marking them as spam.\n\nOn the good side, it was tough, I got it for ~$65 (although for an ugly brown color) which felt like a good deal, the luggage tag pocket and the top pocket were great ideas, and the well-placed handles made it easy to stuff into and remove from various racks and compartments.  If you're interested, you may also want to look at something like the AmazonBasics Carry-On Travel Bag, which looked like a slightly simpler, cheaper knockoff of this.",

I keep the extra bar of soap in with my clothes, which helps to keep them smelling fresh. The liquid soap I use for washing clothes in the sink. And the shaving soap I used for shaving. \n\nThe shaving soap turned out to be extremely useful. We met up with some family in Austria and I was given a jar of homemade blueberry jam to bring home to family in America. Well the first night it ended up leaking in my bag and got all over my merino wool dress shirt. I was able to use the shaving soap as a spot treatment and completely removed the large stain.\n\nIn the end I could have gotten away with leaving the extra bar and the extra shaving soap at home. Currently I'm considering even replacing the shaving soap with the bar soap. So in the future I'll probably bring a single bar of Bronner's and the small bottle of liquid Bronner's.",

I’m a frequent 1-2 night work traveler and so my usual combo is a carry-on and backpack.  Because I’m on the move quite a bit, accessing the backpack top-down or vertically is very important - either while it’s on top of my carry-on or from in between my feet while in flight.\n\nThe EBag seems to function best while on its belly due to the half zip style and its very narrow design. It behaves quite front-heavy and the low trolley strap also worsens this characteristic.  A few times my carry-on + EBag combo almost fell over while I was in transit.  After reading a few more reviews on EBag website, apparently the design was changed without much marketing or publicity about the change.  \n\nIn the end EBag refunded me the entire amount.  Hope this serves as a useful review for someone in the future.  \n\nI remain on the hunt!",

We went back and forth between bags like:\n\nREI Trail 40 ~$110\nOsprey Manta AG 36 ~$175\neBags TLS Mother Lode Weekender Convertible Junior ~$90\nTortuga Travel Backpack ~$200\nOsprey Farpoint ~$160\nOsprey Escapist 32 Pack ~$130\n\nHowever, in the end we're very happy we picked the Manta AG 36 2016, for our travel style it suits us wonderfully, particularly the great Anti-gravity mesh suspension system, and hip belt!

We bought it in 2013 so it’s older…That rough in for the hall bath is 14”, is it possible to use a unifit to put it closer to the wall, or do I try a sioux offset flange? \n\nThank you for being plumbers! I’m just a librarian doing her best here….\n\nPS fwiw master bath rough in is also 14”, we just never cared bc we’re the only people who use it, it’s kind of tucked away.",

            "body": "Just fair warning that when a toilet has been installed for a while, it usually discolors the flooring a bit around the edge and underneath the base. So if you install a toilet with a different offset or base shape/diameter, you run the risk of exposing the discoloration. I'm not a plumber, just speaking from a (bad) experience doing something that sounds very similar to your plan!",
