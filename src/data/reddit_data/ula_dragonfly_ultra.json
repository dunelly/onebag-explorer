It can fit *more* than my 25L Tom Bihn Synapse for those that want a reference. Yet the bag looks small and doesn't take up a bunch of space. This is one of the few bags that can run as an EDC AND One Bag travel.\n\nI used the water bottle pockets to hold a 32oz Hydro-flask and the other to hold my Phone and Toiletries/First aid kit. I love love love the side stretch water bottle pockets. It turns out to be super convenient and I don't think I'll go back to a bag without water bottle pockets. I also enjoy that they are a bit Higher up the bag to hold bigger items.\n\nI think the front stretch pocket is the least useful of all the pockets. I was able to fit in ultra-light sandals and hand wipes. But anything not flat in this front pocket will get stuck because of the stretch cord and stretch material, not to mention the inside of the bag does take the real estate of the front pocket a bit. What I do like is the stretch material is of the same pattern on the Ultra version as the rest of the bag. If you didn't know better you'd think it's of the same material. \n\nI also love the stretch cord (and didn't think I would) because it keeps my climbing shoes in place (see pictures). This has always been an issue with things hanging off of my bag as it ends up whipping someone in the face or getting caught on things. I imagine this would be useful for other shoes and towels.\n\nI do find because of the Dyneema material you will see wrinkles along the bag after use. This could be a con for those that like their materials pristine. I have included pictures of this for those interested.\n\nOverall I'm really pleased with this bag and found it super comfy and \"Ultra\" light. I have owned quite a few bags and this seems to be a winner all around. I liked that when on the shoulders I didn't experience the same kind of \"drag\" I do with other bags. I also feel this bag is able to fit in both travel, EDC, and hiking situations.

This is one of the few bags that can run as an EDC AND One Bag travel.\n\nI used the water bottle pockets to hold a 32oz Hydro-flask and the other to hold my Phone and Toiletries/First aid kit. I love love love the side stretch water bottle pockets. It turns out to be super convenient and I don't think I'll go back to a bag without water bottle pockets. I also enjoy that they are a bit Higher up the bag to hold bigger items.\n\nI think the front stretch pocket is the least useful of all the pockets. I was able to fit in ultra-light sandals and hand wipes. But anything not flat in this front pocket will get stuck because of the stretch cord and stretch material, not to mention the inside of the bag does take the real estate of the front pocket a bit. What I do like is the stretch material is of the same pattern on the Ultra version as the rest of the bag. If you didn't know better you'd think it's of the same material. \n\nI also love the stretch cord (and didn't think I would) because it keeps my climbing shoes in place (see pictures). This has always been an issue with things hanging off of my bag as it ends up whipping someone in the face or getting caught on things. I imagine this would be useful for other shoes and towels.\n\nI do find because of the Dyneema material you will see wrinkles along the bag after use. This could be a con for those that like their materials pristine. I have included pictures of this for those interested.\n\nOverall I'm really pleased with this bag and found it super comfy and \"Ultra\" light. I have owned quite a few bags and this seems to be a winner all around. I liked that when on the shoulders I didn't experience the same kind of \"drag\" I do with other bags. I also feel this bag is able to fit in both travel, EDC, and hiking situations.

            "body": "Hey all!\n\nI've spent the last five months living full-time out of a 45L Tom Bihn Aeronaut, and though I love that bag (and the fact that it's green), it wasn't meeting my needs. I was struggling to organize small items in what was effectively a black hole, and the weight and size was cumbersome.\n\nThat's when I heard about the [ULA Dragonfly](https://www.ula-equipment.com/product/dragonfly/). I was looking for a lighter bag, and someone mentioned ULA will customize their bags, so I figured it was worth reaching out.\n\nTurns out everyone at ULA are awesome! I feel like I asked for *way* too much, but they seemed genuinely stoked about the project and the final result is exactly what I needed.\n\n**Here's what we changed:**\n\n* Added a security loop to the main zipper (thanks to Topo Designs for that idea)\n* Split the front flap pocket in two\n* Swapped the bungie cord for molle (for carrying a bike lock)\n* And added interior pockets to both sides of the bag\n\nThere were a few other small changes, but those were the biggies.\n\nWhen the bag first arrived, the front flap had been sewn wrong, resulting in one of the pockets being stitched shut. I let Peter know, and they took it back and got it sorted extremely quickly (which I really appreciated).\n\nOtherwise, the bag is great! It'll take time to learn how I want to pack it, but it fits everything I was putting in the Aeronaut, minus my jacket and winter boots. The S straps will also take some getting used to, but I've been using the Aeronaut in duffel mode so I think that's just me adjusting to a backpack. I'm a spindly, scrawny guy, so my shoulders could use the workout.\n\nIronically, the bag arrived right as I was settling in one location for the month. My next move won't be until December, but I'll definitely do a packing post when the time comes.\n\nThanks to everyone at ULA for a fantastic bag!",

I was hoping to get one and had been going back and forth with Peter before I got too busy with a move then being sick and now they are too swamped with their backpacking orders to do anymore Dragonfly customizations this season. He didn't want to give me a date because he can't be sure when they'll open that back up again. \n\nSo now I have to decide between a stock or waiting till at least June before getting a custom. And gotta say, it's tough.",

I was struggling to organize small items in what was effectively a black hole, and the weight and size was cumbersome.\n\nThat's when I heard about the [ULA Dragonfly](https://www.ula-equipment.com/product/dragonfly/). I was looking for a lighter bag, and someone mentioned ULA will customize their bags, so I figured it was worth reaching out.\n\nTurns out everyone at ULA are awesome! I feel like I asked for *way* too much, but they seemed genuinely stoked about the project and the final result is exactly what I needed.\n\n**Here's what we changed:**\n\n* Added a security loop to the main zipper (thanks to Topo Designs for that idea)\n* Split the front flap pocket in two\n* Swapped the bungie cord for molle (for carrying a bike lock)\n* And added interior pockets to both sides of the bag\n\nThere were a few other small changes, but those were the biggies.\n\nWhen the bag first arrived, the front flap had been sewn wrong, resulting in one of the pockets being stitched shut. I let Peter know, and they took it back and got it sorted extremely quickly (which I really appreciated).\n\nOtherwise, the bag is great! It'll take time to learn how I want to pack it, but it fits everything I was putting in the Aeronaut, minus my jacket and winter boots. The S straps will also take some getting used to, but I've been using the Aeronaut in duffel mode so I think that's just me adjusting to a backpack. I'm a spindly, scrawny guy, so my shoulders could use the workout.\n\nIronically, the bag arrived right as I was settling in one location for the month. My next move won't be until December, but I'll definitely do a packing post when the time comes.\n\nThanks to everyone at ULA for a fantastic bag!",

It fits in Frontier's sizer if you don't pack it to the brim.\n\nAlso flew Spirit and Cape Air without issue, though I didn't put it in their sizers. \n\nCan add a review/list of packed items if anyone is interested.\n\n[Here are more photos of the bag and length measurement](https://imgur.com/a/rCvIf5Q).",

            "body": "I haven't heard of any Dragonfly failures with their \"weaker\" fabrics. This was not a change made because the old models were insufficient, ULA is just leveraging the popularity of Ultra fabric. I suspect that they're putting the other Dragonfly models on hold and only doing limited Ultra releases so they can continue making products to their more-niche hiking community. Making back their investment on a laser cutter using the Ultra Dragonfly hype train is also a possible reason. Laser cutters kick ass at any sort of synthetic fabric cutting, but especially on any fabric with UHMWPE content because you need wicked sharp scissors to cut it.\n\nI think Ultra is a really cool fabric, being the first widely-available laminate to truly have UHMWPE (Dyneema/Ultra) in the face fabric. The practical benefits of anything UHMWPE is questionable at the moment. Dyneema's composite fabric has **polyester or polyethylene film** as the top layer and yet people raved about how their Dyneema bags are more resistant to abrasion thanks to the Dyneema content. In other words, Ultra anything is probably overkill, especially when [the humble polyester](https://www.garagegrowngear.com/blogs/trail-talk/dcf-vs-ultra-fabric-test-ultralight-packs) is still pretty darn good. \n\nWhich doesn't stop me from trying to make smaller items made from it. I love the fact that it's a super tough woven fiber that's very resistant to stains, with a laminated back layer instead of a polyurethane coating that may be prone to peeling/flaking in a few years.",

I've done single-day 10-20-mile hikes with lots of varying terrain including miles of scree fields, multi-day 30+ mile treks, and week-long 100+ mile treks. They've all held up quite well. And as long as you're feet are strong enough and well-prepped, your feet will feel fine (maybe a bit sore if you're doing too much scree). \n\nHowever, they do take quite long to dry. I did a three-day trek in Vietnam, where almost all of the hiking was through overly thick mud and deep rivers, and those shoes were never going to dry out (Magna FGs). But realistically, in that type of trek, you would need to wear a Croc or water-style shoe to have dry feet (at least at camp). I'm interested in getting the Magna Lite SGs next. They seem like they would do well for drying. My only other issue with the FG and Trek is the outsole started to break away near the toe box area, but some shoe goo fixes that very well. It usually will hold up for around 4-6 months before I would need to reapply. Also, the outsole on the FG/Treks is quite slippery on wet rock and very uncomfortable when walking on pavement for long periods. ESC outsole is a little better in both areas. Not a deal breaker for me, and not something that even needs to be fixed in future iterations, just something worth mentioning.\n\nPrimus Trek lasted about 400 miles. Magna FGs about the same mileage so far (and still using them). And Magna ESCs I got last year and have put some mileage into them. The FGs fit a little better, so I opt for those periodically.\n\nAlso, I tried the Tracker ESCs for a couple of weeks (OPs boots), but I returned them. I really dislike hiking in boots, and they don't fit my ankles very well. The only time I like hiking in boots is in scree fields or other instances where I might want ankle protection, which isn't too often in my experience.",

It has no branding and doesn’t stick out at all. Is it the coolest looking? I certainly don’t think so. The materials feel so premium and it’s so, so light. I packed a couple things in the bag and just wore it around the house like a weirdo and I mean this in all sincerity. At one point I forgot I was wearing it. Absolutely incredible. \n\nThank you to the r/onebag community for showing me this bag. Can’t thank you guys enough. I would have never found this bag otherwise!\n\n",

A few reasons I bought it after owning an Aer Lunar Pack for a few years\n- The Lunar Pack certainly isn’t heavy, but I find it bulky. I wanted something lighter.\n- super nitpicky: I don’t use the front pocket on the Lunar Pack, and I don’t like vertical zip compartments for whatever reason. I like that the Dragonfly is minimal. I only need a top quick access and laptop pocket. It only has the pockets I need. I keep the shock cord on, but I can easily remove it if I don’t want it.\n- I know from owning the Lunar Pack that I like the spaciousness and clamshell style. The Dragonfly is still a clamshell pack.\n- The top handle on the lunar pack is too thick. I had trouble hanging that bag on the hook at some airport bathrooms. The Dragonfly has a thin top handle that extends out more.\n- I got it $100 off since I bought it lightly used on Facebook Marketplace.\n\nWhat I don’t like about the Dragonfly:\n- no side handles\n- no luggage pass through. To get around this, I bought an accessory strap and hooked it to the sides. Although now tbh I somewhat prefer this over a passthrough because it’s easier for me to get the backpack on and off a luggage handle. (Not sure how relevant this point is given we’re in one bag haha)\n- although the point of the bag is being light, it does feel thin.\n- some loose threads",

        "title": "ULA Dragonfly - Quick Review - Backpackers Perspective",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1212zcz/ula_dragonfly_quick_review_backpackers_perspective/",
        "selftext": "Coming from a background in backpacking I was most interested a day pack for day hikes ( &lt; 15 miles ) where I only need enough space for some food, water, and layers for warmth. 5-10lbs.\n\nSecondly, I've been traveling more and wanted bag that could sustain me for a month at a time in warmer climates. I wanted something comfortable to carry through different transit systems and that I don't feel bad about beating it up a bit when using it on day longs hikes at the destination. A bag that can be really used and carried for extended distances.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe ULA Dragonfly carries very heavy loads for it's size ( 20+ lbs ) well for short distances ( 1-2 miles of walking for me ).  This means getting my stuff to what every destination is next.  Once there, It's great at carrying loads of 10ish lbs all day long, either through towns and cities, or jungles and prairies.\n\nIt's deceivingly spacious and in my use can be overstuffed without busting zippers or seams. It's simple compartments work great for those of us who either use packing cubes,  smaller organizational bags, or simply stuff everything in when in transit, then unpack at a homebase at your destination.  No one questioned it's size as a personal item on flights and it fit under 4 different sized aircrafts seats ( see photos )\n\nI would buy it again in a heart beat, but I would purchase the 'ultra dragonfly' for it's ability ( I believe ) to shed rain.  Would love to hear experiences with it in heavy rain for an extended period.\n\nEDIT:  The ULTRA would likely have the same issue... In this photo: [https://preview.redd.it/7hlsc75cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f784f059c315f829fc636917653645e8dae24911](https://preview.redd.it/7hlsc75cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f784f059c315f829fc636917653645e8dae24911) you can see a crease in the top of the bag.  Water was pooling here for many hours in pouring down rain.  Once it pools it was seeping through the seams on the sides . I just confirmed this in the sink and added two photos ( last two ) to this post.  I believe had I packed it better so this crease wouldn't be there the bag would have shed more water.  All that said I wouldn't expect any bag, except for a bombproof roll top bag to perform better now that I think about it a bit more.\n\nThe lesson, for me, is to put a trash bag and add anything that can not get wet.  Again,  I was in a torrential downpour for many many hours.  Most sane people would have left the trail or found shelter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* lightweight, simple pack. No logo, doesn't scream steal me\n* great carry system, although no hip belt ( not needed in my opinion ) does have attachment points for one\n* No issues carrying on as personal item or fitting under seats on planes\n* small enough even if overhead bin is 'full' it can be jammed into some gaps\n* holds shape when empty or under size capacity\n* bungie to lash items to the back of bag work very well and has lots of stretch\n* handy top compartment for items that need to be fetched frequently ( keys, phone, cables, wallet, battery back, etc )\n* I'm used to top loading bags for hikes -- This being more of a clamshell I was worried it would be a pain to frequently take things in and out, this has not been the case. Zips are fast and towards the top of the bag that nothing falls out when unzipped at touch when wearing\n* This kinda blew my mind -- Even when super stuffed my 13' macbook air still slide in and out without much effort.  Just about every bag I've used in the past this can be an issue.  I'm frequently pulling out and putting in my laptop, so this was a pleasant surprise.\n* Material is very resistant to abrasion, still looks good after heavy use - Note: it looks used, and shows dirt when you set it in mud, but no holes, fraying, etc.\n* Great support.  You have questions, they have answers and are responsive\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons ( some expected )**\n\n* I wish the side pockets were more stretchy.\n* Not 100% waterproof, bag had an inch of water in main compartment after several hours of very heavy rain, top compartment stayed bone dry interestingly enough - 'ULTRA' version of this bag seems to be waterproof.  EDIT, see update above ULTRA would have had the same issue ( expected ). \n* Top handle was a pain to grab sometimes bag is laid down because it's floppy and tends to rest under the bag\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Meh:**\n\n* Wish the sternum strap was not on a bungie\n* Zippers seem a touch small in size, but so far are holding up.\n* Back padding holds some water when in heavy rain\n* Shoulder straps are super stiff when new.  I was very close to returning the bag because of the 'S' shaped shoulder straps hit the side of my arms when in the hanging position. I read they break in, and that is correct thankfully, but it did take some time, be patient.\n* One could argue there are better looking bags. In my option function over form, so I like the simplicity of the design, others may not\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What I packed:**\n\nMy total weight was around 22 lbs including the bag for a little over a week on an island 70-80 degrees.   This was certainly over stuffed.  Next trip I'll drop at least a third of the weight by carrying less clothing.\n\n**Clothes:**\n\n1\\] swimsuit\n\n1\\] long sleeve rash shirt\n\n2\\] sun hats\n\n1\\] pair sun gloves\n\n6\\] pairs of socks\n\n6\\] boxer briefs\n\n3\\] long sleeve sun shirts\n\n5\\] shorts\n\n2\\] pants\n\n6\\] short sleeve shirts\n\n1\\] pajama pants\n\n1\\] pair 'dress' shoes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other:**\n\n* deodorant\n* electric toothbrush\n* sunglasses\n* bar soap\n* 1L collapsible water bottles\n* sunblock\n* packable backpack\n* sleep-mask\n* hydroflask\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Electronics ( some not in photos )**\n\n* 13' MacBook Air\n* battery bank\n* 6' usb-c cables6-in-1 charging cable\n* bloothtooth speaker\n* anker usb-c charger\n* MOGICS Super Bagel &lt;- love this thing!\n* Bose QC II earbuts\n* extra cell phone\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/952ekx4cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9b087d3e76b946e3f2f00b074fc8e1384187c2c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/douiqy4cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4274c79ee19aaa680cae74d98b47c24da343d6a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2okf115cwrpa1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=596accec2c232a6b3fb0612a454b962b912ee9db\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86bpj65cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce1c8f901310b9428df6dbed1d17f9b891840b47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/trsq2p4cwrpa1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=702108e31c0d26b5d8f654f9cbeb9952d0ec5868\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/craeyu5cwrpa1.png?width=3072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d5eb3d92d71d0a1505b2798c849b3fe108318e2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/idh8sw5cwrpa1.png?width=3072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c991506d20570c20a34fbe52fe49ee3a279e2ceb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hlsc75cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e54e4a91492d6640c92b7f898ead79bfb0d7bfc9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eqqkgp5cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12297fbaf984b9403370c4a75cdbd2f7fa61e473\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cc9vp4cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=396ece728edb05783eeb6b074b9ab2f091f97e94\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bq35fr4cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af59d9ab270ed4f1b502549fbefecbded81fad75\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aal1cs4cwrpa1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7f7e304a8404f5d919f1123eab0f79e014e71d6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p52zrt4cwrpa1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2508ccd698d689efd74f61c28529502a00cd12f8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qie4ju4cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d97124cacf0a88a54dceb35923e5125adc253b42\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7gk1m85cwrpa1.jpg?width=3072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4681c76bdd9e40db433c2135f9ba0a4a882ab49\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0twtx5cwrpa1.png?width=4080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfeda92aad9621c687d0ddf6c67daa8431734c44\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olsdbv4cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d65178b8df3faf553b58ca06a17015624e119d98\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vdm4w4cwrpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62c3dfc36b82ec7cca1bcd02023abfe38bfdec17\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ajijoywatpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a1654d5a505a4cf396e14bb6c3e172ef969b74a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6aev0mvxatpa1.jpg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8aa84a6badff0c5690cab387bfe04aa498dbb59",

Quick summary:\n\nBlack Diamond Robic: Feels amazing, slick, soft and flexible, very quiet.  Slightly heavier weight overall.\n\nBrushed Green:  Looks amazing, beautiful in-person, rich green color.  Thinner, slightly rougher, lighter weight, and a bit louder (crinkle).  Pet hair magnet.  Bonus that the ultrastretch mesh is much nicer than the standard that comes on the Black Robic\n\nVerdict:  Hard to say which one I will keep, green wins hands down on looks and weight, plus the Ultrastretch is a nice upgrade, but the black feels like a nicer, sturdier fabric overall. The 400B is also DWR treated, not sure about the 330, but if you really want waterproof you will need the Ultra version.  Bonus shot of the Ultra shoulder strap pocket (highly recommended)",

Not to mention charging more for the larger version and not changing the strap width at all, not even a snidgen is frustrating when I know how good it could be. The extra weight makes the straps that were fine on the 30l uncomfortable on the 36. I can’t even imagine them on the Camino, since they don’t change them on that bag either. I see pictures of when the bag had wider straps and it looks so much more comfortable.",
