            "body": "Bellroy recently launched the ‘travel lite backpack’ and was in the market for a lightweight 30L backpack, and as I’m heading to Italy tomorrow, I thought this would fit the bill. I haven’t traveled with it yet, but I’ll update you after my trip. Here’s some of what I’ve packed:\n\n1) Here’s the 30L next to a Peak Design tech pouch. It’s filled to the brim with stuff and a chunky-looking boi, which I don’t mind as long as comfort isn’t sacrificed.\n\n2) I love the clamshell opening. I’ve been one-bagging for a decade, and this is my first entry to the clam life, and I’m kicking myself for not going this route earlier. To the top left are socks and undies for five days. Underneath them are three dress shirts (one long sleeve and two pairs of shorts). This would usually go in a packing cube, but there is no need for that now. Let’s see what’s on the right \n\n3) Woah, that’s a lot! A Bellroy sling with cameras, a pair of size 12 sneakers, a packing cube with one pair of pants, two pairs of shorts, two T-shirts, Matador toiletries, and a hat. Oh, and there is an iPad that goes in the back, but here it is anyway. \n\n4) Here in the front, we have a small packing cube with random goodies (sanitizer, lens wipes, asthma inhaler, tea bags, etc.), sunglasses, a pouch with a light jacket, a pair of Sony 1000XM5 headphones, a wallet, and some chocolates. We have to have snacks. \n\n5) Here’s a quick peek into my tech pouch and sling. I personally find the teach pouch overengineered. The regular pouch is good enough for me, but I got it free from work, so why not? It’s fine. In the sling are two cameras and an extra lens.\n\n\nSome other thoughts so far: \n- Let’s talk straps and comfort. I’m a 6-foot husky boi with relatively broad shoulders, and it feels somewhat awkward - both empty and full. The straps are short and narrow. A part of me hopes that it’s something I’ll get used to, but we’ll see. I went from loving everything about the pack to being slightly skeptical - which isn’t a great feeling when it’s a $200 backpack with only a three-year warranty. \n\n- I’m unsure if I’ll attach the tech pouch with a small carabiner or carry the sling separately and throw the tech pouch in the bag. TBD.\n\n- I might dump the light jacket. \n\n- My phone, passport, and AirPods aren’t pictured because I’ll have them in my pocket while in transit. \n\n- What I like about the pack is how flexible it is. What I mean is that I can pack it to the brim with my size 12 shoes and cameras, or you can throw in your espresso machine instead, or not, and keep it super simple. Because it’s essentially one big compartment, you have plenty of flexibility to tailor things to your needs. \n\n- Build quality seems excellent so far. Longevity is mainly how I value bags, so let me return in five years!\n\n\n\nEdit/update 1:\n\n- Comfort: I’ve walked about 14 miles in a span of three days with the pack and it’s been a breeze. Comfort level is significantly better than what I initially expected. Yes, the straps are still too short but fit and comfort is really good. \n\n- weather resistance: I was caught in an extreme downpour today in Milan, so much so that there’s currently flooding happening. Furthermore all trains were cancelled at the station where I was at due to flooding so I had to get to another station by foot. All in all I was out for about 20 minutes and I’m pretty impressed. Some water got through on the vertical seam but nothing significant. The small top compartment however got more water in and my wallet and passport are currently air drying. It wasn’t soaked by any means, but I doubt a small power bank would’ve survived. Needless to say it was nice to find out that while I was completely soaked, all my electronics were safe and sound.

            "body": "Bellroy recently launched the ‘travel lite backpack’ and was in the market for a lightweight 30L backpack, and as I’m heading to Italy tomorrow, I thought this would fit the bill. I haven’t traveled with it yet, but I’ll update you after my trip. Here’s some of what I’ve packed:\n\n1) Here’s the 30L next to a Peak Design tech pouch. It’s filled to the brim with stuff and a chunky-looking boi, which I don’t mind as long as comfort isn’t sacrificed.\n\n2) I love the clamshell opening. I’ve been one-bagging for a decade, and this is my first entry to the clam life, and I’m kicking myself for not going this route earlier. To the top left are socks and undies for five days. Underneath them are three dress shirts (one long sleeve and two pairs of shorts). This would usually go in a packing cube, but there is no need for that now. Let’s see what’s on the right \n\n3) Woah, that’s a lot! A Bellroy sling with cameras, a pair of size 12 sneakers, a packing cube with one pair of pants, two pairs of shorts, two T-shirts, Matador toiletries, and a hat. Oh, and there is an iPad that goes in the back, but here it is anyway. \n\n4) Here in the front, we have a small packing cube with random goodies (sanitizer, lens wipes, asthma inhaler, tea bags, etc.), sunglasses, a pouch with a light jacket, a pair of Sony 1000XM5 headphones, a wallet, and some chocolates. We have to have snacks. \n\n5) Here’s a quick peek into my tech pouch and sling. I personally find the teach pouch overengineered. The regular pouch is good enough for me, but I got it free from work, so why not? It’s fine. In the sling are two cameras and an extra lens.\n\n\nSome other thoughts so far: \n- Let’s talk straps and comfort. I’m a 6-foot husky boi with relatively broad shoulders, and it feels somewhat awkward - both empty and full. The straps are short and narrow. A part of me hopes that it’s something I’ll get used to, but we’ll see. I went from loving everything about the pack to being slightly skeptical - which isn’t a great feeling when it’s a $200 backpack with only a three-year warranty. \n\n- I’m unsure if I’ll attach the tech pouch with a small carabiner or carry the sling separately and throw the tech pouch in the bag. TBD.\n\n- I might dump the light jacket. \n\n- My phone, passport, and AirPods aren’t pictured because I’ll have them in my pocket while in transit. \n\n- What I like about the pack is how flexible it is. What I mean is that I can pack it to the brim with my size 12 shoes and cameras, or you can throw in your espresso machine instead, or not, and keep it super simple. Because it’s essentially one big compartment, you have plenty of flexibility to tailor things to your needs. \n\n- Build quality seems excellent so far. Longevity is mainly how I value bags, so let me return in five years!\n\n\n\nEdit/update 1:\n\n- Comfort: I’ve walked about 14 miles in a span of three days with the pack and it’s been a breeze. Comfort level is significantly better than what I initially expected. Yes, the straps are still too short but fit and comfort is really good. \n\n- weather resistance: I was caught in an extreme downpour today in Milan, so much so that there’s currently flooding happening. Furthermore all trains were cancelled at the station where I was at due to flooding so I had to get to another station by foot. All in all I was out for about 20 minutes and I’m pretty impressed. Some water got through on the vertical seam but nothing significant. The small top compartment however got more water in and my wallet and passport are currently air drying. It wasn’t soaked by any means, but I doubt a small power bank would’ve survived. Needless to say it was nice to find out that while I was completely soaked, all my electronics were safe and sound.

            "body": "Bellroy recently launched the ‘travel lite backpack’ and was in the market for a lightweight 30L backpack, and as I’m heading to Italy tomorrow, I thought this would fit the bill. I haven’t traveled with it yet, but I’ll update you after my trip. Here’s some of what I’ve packed:\n\n1) Here’s the 30L next to a Peak Design tech pouch. It’s filled to the brim with stuff and a chunky-looking boi, which I don’t mind as long as comfort isn’t sacrificed.\n\n2) I love the clamshell opening. I’ve been one-bagging for a decade, and this is my first entry to the clam life, and I’m kicking myself for not going this route earlier. To the top left are socks and undies for five days. Underneath them are three dress shirts (one long sleeve and two pairs of shorts). This would usually go in a packing cube, but there is no need for that now. Let’s see what’s on the right \n\n3) Woah, that’s a lot! A Bellroy sling with cameras, a pair of size 12 sneakers, a packing cube with one pair of pants, two pairs of shorts, two T-shirts, Matador toiletries, and a hat. Oh, and there is an iPad that goes in the back, but here it is anyway. \n\n4) Here in the front, we have a small packing cube with random goodies (sanitizer, lens wipes, asthma inhaler, tea bags, etc.), sunglasses, a pouch with a light jacket, a pair of Sony 1000XM5 headphones, a wallet, and some chocolates. We have to have snacks. \n\n5) Here’s a quick peek into my tech pouch and sling. I personally find the teach pouch overengineered. The regular pouch is good enough for me, but I got it free from work, so why not? It’s fine. In the sling are two cameras and an extra lens.\n\n\nSome other thoughts so far: \n- Let’s talk straps and comfort. I’m a 6-foot husky boi with relatively broad shoulders, and it feels somewhat awkward - both empty and full. The straps are short and narrow. A part of me hopes that it’s something I’ll get used to, but we’ll see. I went from loving everything about the pack to being slightly skeptical - which isn’t a great feeling when it’s a $200 backpack with only a three-year warranty. \n\n- I’m unsure if I’ll attach the tech pouch with a small carabiner or carry the sling separately and throw the tech pouch in the bag. TBD.\n\n- I might dump the light jacket. \n\n- My phone, passport, and AirPods aren’t pictured because I’ll have them in my pocket while in transit. \n\n- What I like about the pack is how flexible it is. What I mean is that I can pack it to the brim with my size 12 shoes and cameras, or you can throw in your espresso machine instead, or not, and keep it super simple. Because it’s essentially one big compartment, you have plenty of flexibility to tailor things to your needs. \n\n- Build quality seems excellent so far. Longevity is mainly how I value bags, so let me return in five years!\n\n\n\nEdit/update 1:\n\n- Comfort: I’ve walked about 14 miles in a span of three days with the pack and it’s been a breeze. Comfort level is significantly better than what I initially expected. Yes, the straps are still too short but fit and comfort is really good. \n\n- weather resistance: I was caught in an extreme downpour today in Milan, so much so that there’s currently flooding happening.

            "body": "Was umming and ahhhing about this backpack but pulled the trigger, even though I was hesitant to spend that kind of money on a bag I hadn't seen in person.  Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

I'm really confused by the choices here.\n\nThe biggest differences I see between this an the Venture Ready non-travel is the water-resistant fabric, the gimmicky tote, additional increased dimensions (except the reduction in depth) and hidden water bottle container? I guess you could count the additional interior straps as a travel feature. But the bag only has a 6.1 inch depth, so is that really needed?\n\nDimensions measure 22 inches x 15.75 inches x 6.1, so it can't take advantage of the typical carry on sizes (22 in x 14 in x 9 in) offered by major airlines and it's too big for a personal item. Also the hidden water bottle eats into the main compartment? Worst of all the bag retains the thin shoulder straps with no added hip belt. As a traveler you'd want a quality carry system.\n\nAll for a total of $329, with no lifetime guarantee? Though, I'll admit it's a nice looking bag like all other Bellroy bags.",

Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

        "selftext": "For the past year or so I have used a Zpacks bagger 25 ultra.I loved this pack because of the weight (only 310g). However that pack is not always the best in use... Not a lot of organization/access, very loud and crinkly and no place to really put a laptop which I often have to travel with. \n\nAfter purchasing a Bellroy lite sling (which is excellent) I recently saw Bellroy released the travel pack lite 30l and at sub 1kg with much more organization it intrigued me so I picked one up for my upcoming 6 month trip through Asia.\n\nIn my test pack I think I am going to really love this bag. A couple of things stand out to me. \n\n- Each and every pocket has its own dimension so when you use one space it doesn't eat into the other space. The fabric on the front pockets also has some stretchto it which is nice. \n\n- The fabric is also nice and soft and quiet. \n\n- The organization is also well thought out and just enough. To be honest it is basically a smaller cotopaxi allpa 35 with lighter materials and a extra pocket on the front. I always liked the layout of the allpa but not the materials or the weight. \n\n- I really like the zippers and zipper pulls. \n\n- The straps are much better than I thought they would be. \n\n- This thing can fit a lot of stuff. The load out in the pictures is more than I plan on taking but I wanted to see how much I could fit. \n\nThe one obvious miss is the lack of a water bottle holder. \n\nI am looking forward to running this bag through its paces over the next few months. \n\n",

They’ve been moving away from leather for a while and I don’t like their new stuff. I have the A5 leather notebook and I love that thing so much, it looks and feels great. But if you compare that with their new offering of the Tokyo Folio, which just looks clunky and cheap and poorly made. It’s not sexy, sleek, or stylish. And the prices have stayed the same or gone up for lesser quality. Also a side note, their emails used to be gorgeous. I have reached out several times to them just to applaud their designer. But now they are stale, cookie cutter email templates. Just seems like they got too big and are cutting corners to maximize profits. Sorry for the long read.",

I made a post last year prior to going to Italy for two weeks, and I have since been on several other trips with the bag. The really short version is that I ended up selling it —It was so close to being the perfect bag, but those straps were unbearable.\n\nI wrote a lengthy review on my Substack, so feel free to check it out if you want the long version. I’m also very new to the Substack platform, so if someone else is on, let’s connect! I'm happy to answer any questions about the bag :) ",

            "body": "Here's my initial review of the Bellroy Venture 2.5L vs Lite mini 4L: [Photos for comparison](https://imgur.com/a/ZRwA0dR)Edit: Added more photos.\n\nHere is my loadout, the main goal is to carry minimal gear + occasionally water bottle, for travel and EDC. I care more about functionality, and secondly aesthetics.\n\n* Phone\n* Wallet\n* 500ml/16oz water bottle\n* Passport\n* Earbuds\n* Room for other small items, lip balm hand sanitizer bottle etc\n\n**Similararities**\n\n* Both slings are able to fit the above, and are comfortable to carry.\n* Straps are almost identical, with possibly the lite mini with a slightly thinner strap\n* Both fit a switch with side controls on\n* Bellroy measures their width by the zipper, the actual dimensions are different than listed. Measurements below.\n\n**Venture 2.5L**\n\n* Measures (mm): Listed: 220x150x100 (real: 250x150x100). With the different design, the front pocket has its own depth now (unlike other ventures).\n* Fits all the gear well, but does become too bulky, brick-like. Against the body, it definitely sticks out too much. With a narrow water bottle, this will become less, but I still think the lite would look better\n* Surprisingly the front pocket is still very accessible, and I love the divider.\n* The rugged material of the venture means one-hand zipping is easy\n* For such a small bag, the zipper pulls do seem too big. Plus the exposed front zip means you can see all 3 zippers\n* I don't love the phone sleeve. It is a little loose and takes up a fair amount of space. A thinner one would work better. Also, it would be better if it was slightly raised for easier access\n* The sunglass pocket is a little flappy\n* The back pocket is great and fits your passport or phone (pixel 5)\n* No side gussets, and the zippers don't go as wide as the venture line. This makes access to the main compartment slightly harder\n* Overall, great organisation\n* Looks better when not overpacked\n\n**Lite Mini 4L**\n\n* Meausres (mm): Listed: 200x170x70 (real: 240x175x70)\n* Fits all the gear well, and still remains slim looking\n* Same typical front pocket, not the most usable with the main compartment stuffed. Can still be used for earbuds, lip balm\n* Its lacking organisation, and feels like it needs one more internal pocket for my needs. I may stitch on a mesh pocket as I've seen other redditers do\n* Love love love the gussets on the main compartment, this is probably the best feature\n* The small side pocket in the main compartment is pretty sleek, meaning that something in there could slide out the side gusset, in a not so typical scenario. The bag would have to be upside down, and shaken. I still wouldn't put something valuable in there like earbuds.\n\nNeither sling is perfect, I like the organisation on the venture 2.5L but overall the design of the Lite mini looks better IMO. If hardly carrying anything, the venture 2.5L looks better, but the Lite mini is more versatile and will look good in most situations.\n\nEdit: I have returned the venture 2.5L, and I'll be keeping the lite sling mini. Mainly because it holds a water bottle better.",

When filled out the bag does become a brick and is not comfortable to wear. I’m just going to rock my Venture 9L for my EDC, despite being much larger it is much more comfortable, holds all my EDC and I can fit a water bottle in it comfortably.

        "selftext": "This is my current work and personal setup: I have a Bellroy Classic backpack in lunar that holds water, tech kit, journal, personal items, and then I also include a Bellroy Lite sling (color is called “copper”). The green and gray small pouch is by the Doughbut brand—bought that one on JetPens—and it contains work items like my badge and work keys. I carry everything in my backpack into my clinic and office areas, then if I’m lucky with a lunch break, I take the sling with me to grab coffee or go on a quick walk. That allows me to carry my badge, keys, AirPods, phone, and sometimes a book with me without the “bigness” of the backpack for what’s usually a pretty quick jaunt outside. On the weekends, that little green pouch gets tucked away, and I use the backpack for daily carry. I have been LOVING this setup so far!!!",
