            "body": "Really enjoying this bag so far. At $128, it's definitely not cheap but it doesn't feel super cheap, either. This is my first Lululemon bag and to be fair, I only own a couple pairs of their pants. Not a huge fan of the brand but I know they make \"quality\" stuff so I was curious to try it out.\n\nFor reference, I am 6'4\", 270lbs.\n\n* At 28L, it definitely doesn't \"feel\" like 28L - a lot like how lots of The North Face bags don't feel their capacity, either. I have a Recon bag and it feels bigger than that, oddly enough.\n* I am comparing this to my newly-purchased Aer City Pack Pro 24L X-Pac. I feel like the Triple-Zip is bigger and \"better\" than that bag but the Aer is so much more premium. The X-Pac is legit. The Aer also has better \"pockets\" and I low how the Aer opens up like a clamshell for the main compartment.\n* That said, I do love this bag because it's super stealthy looking, has a great \"shape\", and the lime-green interior is fantastic. Nothing is getting lost again. I love the color. \n* I love the two water bottle pockets (my CPP only has one) and although there's no \"quick\" compartment on the top to store keys, whatever, there is a \"zippered\" compartment in the main area that you can drop things into. \n* The laptop compartment has a false bottom but no \"sleeve\" to drop the laptop in. It will move around loosely.\n* The top handle is great, better than most bags I've had, but not as legit as the insane CPP's top handle (thing is a beast).\n* **Most importantly,** I believe this bag is far more comfortable on my back than the CPP. The straps are curved much better to my body type and the load lifters (sorely missing from the CPP) are fantastic for helping distribute the weight correctly.\n* The back padding is similar to the CPP and the \"vertical\" luggage strap is whatever. I know some people hate it, but I didn't mind it going through ORD yesterday.\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic bag and I am excited to put some more time on it and the interior is just right up my alley. The overall look makes me very happy. I think it's one of the best looking bags out there - I am mad, yes. Haha.

I have a Recon bag and it feels bigger than that, oddly enough.\n* I am comparing this to my newly-purchased Aer City Pack Pro 24L X-Pac. I feel like the Triple-Zip is bigger and \"better\" than that bag but the Aer is so much more premium. The X-Pac is legit. The Aer also has better \"pockets\" and I low how the Aer opens up like a clamshell for the main compartment.\n* That said, I do love this bag because it's super stealthy looking, has a great \"shape\", and the lime-green interior is fantastic. Nothing is getting lost again. I love the color. \n* I love the two water bottle pockets (my CPP only has one) and although there's no \"quick\" compartment on the top to store keys, whatever, there is a \"zippered\" compartment in the main area that you can drop things into. \n* The laptop compartment has a false bottom but no \"sleeve\" to drop the laptop in. It will move around loosely.\n* The top handle is great, better than most bags I've had, but not as legit as the insane CPP's top handle (thing is a beast).\n* **Most importantly,** I believe this bag is far more comfortable on my back than the CPP. The straps are curved much better to my body type and the load lifters (sorely missing from the CPP) are fantastic for helping distribute the weight correctly.\n* The back padding is similar to the CPP and the \"vertical\" luggage strap is whatever. I know some people hate it, but I didn't mind it going through ORD yesterday.\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic bag and I am excited to put some more time on it and the interior is just right up my alley.

            "body": "Really enjoying this bag so far. At $128, it's definitely not cheap but it doesn't feel super cheap, either. This is my first Lululemon bag and to be fair, I only own a couple pairs of their pants. Not a huge fan of the brand but I know they make \"quality\" stuff so I was curious to try it out.\n\nFor reference, I am 6'4\", 270lbs.\n\n* At 28L, it definitely doesn't \"feel\" like 28L - a lot like how lots of The North Face bags don't feel their capacity, either. I have a Recon bag and it feels bigger than that, oddly enough.\n* I am comparing this to my newly-purchased Aer City Pack Pro 24L X-Pac. I feel like the Triple-Zip is bigger and \"better\" than that bag but the Aer is so much more premium. The X-Pac is legit. The Aer also has better \"pockets\" and I low how the Aer opens up like a clamshell for the main compartment.\n* That said, I do love this bag because it's super stealthy looking, has a great \"shape\", and the lime-green interior is fantastic. Nothing is getting lost again. I love the color. \n* I love the two water bottle pockets (my CPP only has one) and although there's no \"quick\" compartment on the top to store keys, whatever, there is a \"zippered\" compartment in the main area that you can drop things into. \n* The laptop compartment has a false bottom but no \"sleeve\" to drop the laptop in. It will move around loosely.\n* The top handle is great, better than most bags I've had, but not as legit as the insane CPP's top handle (thing is a beast).\n* **Most importantly,** I believe this bag is far more comfortable on my back than the CPP. The straps are curved much better to my body type and the load lifters (sorely missing from the CPP) are fantastic for helping distribute the weight correctly.\n* The back padding is similar to the CPP and the \"vertical\" luggage strap is whatever. I know some people hate it, but I didn't mind it going through ORD yesterday.\n\nOverall, it is a fantastic bag and I am excited to put some more time on it and the interior is just right up my alley. The overall look makes me very happy. I think it's one of the best looking bags out there - I am mad, yes. Haha. Hope this helps!\n\nhttps://shop.lululemon.com/p/accessories/Triple-Zip-Backpack-28L/\\_/prod11500009?color=46847&amp;sz=ONESIZE",

An all arounder I think the rhake is better.  It depends on what you plan to carry from the grocery store.  In all honesty I would proably bump up to the vandal for groceries as the rambler still had some constraints with the width of the zippers getting in the weight.  Rhake I find easier to put stuff in while grocery shopping because it's straight up a roll top with a wide bucket at the top.  Rambler will fit more stuff due to the depth though.    \n\n\nRhake is easily better for EDC.  The compartments are great, and easy to use IMO.",

An all arounder I think the rhake is better.  It depends on what you plan to carry from the grocery store.  In all honesty I would proably bump up to the vandal for groceries as the rambler still had some constraints with the width of the zippers getting in the weight.  Rhake I find easier to put stuff in while grocery shopping because it's straight up a roll top with a wide bucket at the top.  Rambler will fit more stuff due to the depth though.    \n\n\nRhake is easily better for EDC.  The compartments are great, and easy to use IMO.",

Yeah, what you see here is the Default almost full but not to the brim, &amp; apart from “buttons” to secure it at two points when fully extended, there’s no way to close/secure it as the Velcro’d middle “tongue” isn’t long enough.\n\nIn terms of “feel”, although it is pretty solidly built, it’s flimsy &amp; just doesn’t have that solid quality feel I’m accustomed to with MW gear. It doesn’t have the carbon fiber backing like MW, the waist strap is a flimsy piece of thin strap, unlike MW’s solid thick waist straps. I’ll try to post pics of both. \n\nThe inside looks like somebody just threw in a piece of thin sailcloth-like fabric &amp; then that’s it. Plain &amp; no reinforcement stitchings...\n\nThe only two positive things I like are it’s light &amp; way cheaper.\n\nMW is like BMW, once you’ve “tasted” them you’ll never want any other bags.\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not a MW staff, &amp; I’m not paid/sponsored to say this. I just have an eye for quality. 😅",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MissionWorkshop/comments/amuz5i/an_indepth_look_at_the_mission_workshop_rhake/",
        "selftext": "# Mission Workshop Rhake Review\n\nI only put that subtitle in there so that people looking for info on the Rhake can find this more easily on Google. The following isn’t really a review — I just want to share some of my experience of the last few weeks with the Rhake with you and point out some of the stuff that other reviews missed. \n\n# Introduction\n\nBefore I decided to buy the Rhake I was using the Vandal as my everyday backpack. I bought it years ago when I was still working as a bike messenger and it has been the best backpack I owned so far. But the times changed and I don’t really need a cargo backpack that often anymore.\n\nI commute to work by bike and I take my laptop to work everyday. Besides what I bring home from the grocery store and my gym clothes I don’t have much stuff to carry around nowadays. What I did miss on the Vandal was organization and a proper place to put my laptop. \n\nThe Rhake seemed to be exactly the backpack that met my needs. I won’t bore you with all the details and features because you probably know them already from all the other sites and reviews. What I will do instead is, give you a quick look at how I use it, what I find noteworthy and interesting and how to improve your Rhake a little bit.\n\n# What goes where?\n\nI basically carry the same items everyday but it is a lot of fun to optimize where to store your items as the Rhake gives you lots of options. This is what I usually carry:\n\n* padded laptop compartment\n   * laptop\n* rolltop main compartments\n   * laptop charger\n   * water bottle\n   * rain jacket\n   * gym clothes and climbing shoes\n   * food box\n* tablet / front compartment\n   * (sometimes bike lights and gloves)\n* left zippered pocket\n   * ballpoint pen\n   * in-ear headset\n   * USB cable\n   * swiss army knife\n   * “climb-on” skin nourishment stick\n   * a pack of facial tissues\n   * locker room padlock\n* right zippered pocket\n   * notebook/journal\n   * trail mix\n   * ebook reader\n* bottom pouch\n   * tool roll with bike tools\n   * (sometimes bike lights)\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nThe tablet front compartment only works for me if the backpack isn’t filled to the brim. It becomes difficult to get items in and out when the pouch is flattened and you always pull the liner out. I like that pocket nonetheless and it isn’t so much of a problem when the pouch can grow into the main compartment.\n\nThe horizontal straps can serve as a U-lock holder. A feature I dearly missed on the Vandal. Now I can just swing the bag around my side and shove the lock in and out. Pretty neat! \n\nThe secret pocket that has the elastic water bottle holder can serve as a place to put your wallet or smartphone. In case you put a wallet in there it should be a slim one — big items will pike your kidney and it will be uncomfortable.\n\n# Capacity\n\nMission Workshop’s statement about the Rhake having a 22 liter main compartment is very accurate.  There was a time where I was very skeptical, though, because I was seeing lots of other backpacks that are also said to have around 20 liter of volume but looked smaller than the Rhake.\n\nI did a little experiment and put a trashbag inside the Rhake’s main compartment and filled it with water. After filling it with 25 liters, the water level was as high as the internal zipper compartment. That’s impressive but please keep in mind that this also means that there isn’t enough gusset length anymore to use the rolltop function. I didn’t pour more than 25 liters in there because I was too lazy to clean up an eventual mess.\n\nHave a look at the photos I took. The lighting is not the best so I added a water texture I got from Google Image Search to help you see the waterline.\n\n[https://i.redd.it/j2znr8a6ife21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/j2znr8a6ife21.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/ntkdyq86ife21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ntkdyq86ife21.jpg)\n\nUnder normal circumstances, your items also won’t fill the space as efficiently as water does — and it already is hard to access the smaller compartments from the outside if the bag’s 22 liters are used up. With 22 liters of water in there, the Rhake got quite a belly making it impossible to access items in the external pockets and it became a real effort to close the zippers.\n\nCarrying a laptop in the dedicated laptop compartment will reduce its capacity by a greater margin than you might think. The padding is generous and an inserted laptop will prevent the backpacks main space from bulging outwards leading to a higher stack of items inside.\n\nSee the photo below for an example of what can fit inside when there’s no laptop involved. Please note that the small items stored in the front pockets are excluded from the photo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What fits into the Rhake.](https://preview.redd.it/nrdt0mcl7xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02bb846654b0f40830982d8b3983a39362bedcc6)\n\n[The Gadgeteer claims](https://the-gadgeteer.com/2018/04/06/mission-workshop-rhake-backpack-review/) that you can fit 28 liters in there using the adjustable strap. That sounds plausible but I doubt that they really measured it. Additionally, do not expect it to be weatherproof anymore and make sure that you have a large item on top and not small ones that can fall out of the bag.\n\n# What other reviews criticised and has since been fixed\n\nFrom what I gathered from the web, there are at least three different iterations of the Rhake by now: \n\n* [v1 w/ load lifter straps, one zipper slider on each front pocket](https://vimeo.com/258881943)\n* [v2 w/ load lifter straps , two zipper sliders on each front pocket](https://www.magneticmag.com/culture/mission-workshop-rhake-weatherproof-backpack-review)\n* [v3 no load lifter straps, two zipper sliders on each front pocket](https://imgur.com/a/tQSYStY)\n\nMaybe the length of the rolltop closing strap also changed from one iteration to the other but I’m not sure about that.\n\n[Bo Ismono stated that one needs to be very diligent when closing the front zippered pockets. ](https://youtu.be/XXbMt6oPqv0?t=166)The zipper had to be closed completely to prevent water ingress. As current Rhakes have two zippers on each front pocket instead of one, there are more options in opening/closing the pockets. Closing the zipper leaving the zipper slides on the side or bottom of the pocket will make it impossible for water to ingress. The second zipper slide is really a handy upgrade!\n\nWhile at first, I thought I’d miss the load lifter straps on the shoulders (knowing that I made heavy use of them on my Vandal), I can’t say that I actually did so far. I guess Mission Workshop removed them as a lot of reviews complained about the Rhake having too many straps and that user testing showed that they weren’t actually needed on a slim 22 liter backpack. \n\n## Improving the zipper pulls \n\nIt can be cumbersome to find/grab the zipper pulls for the front pockets when they’re hiding in the nook that forms below the tablet pocket when the bag is saggy. As a remedy, you can replace the zipper pulls with ones that are a few centimeters longer. While you’re at it, you can also attach zipper pulls to the tablet compartment and the bottom pocket, if you like. To do that, it’s best to use paracord type 750 IV (4.2mm diameter) and remove 3-4 strands of the core filaments. That way they’ll have a nice soft oval touch and won’t be so firm. (I think that’s what Mission Workshop did to their cords). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Comparison of original and my custom zipper pull length.](https://preview.redd.it/374zi1yf7xl21.jpg?width=6072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff7616b84cb71edbb16d3e257efaede33c5ee83a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Longer zipper pull](https://preview.redd.it/2ac5dknb7xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c55325d9cde695e98e87070d907f01526a288e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Remove 3-4 core strands from the paracord to give it a better feel.](https://preview.redd.it/3vz0j6197xl21.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab7215db593928d50e3799b12bb921011b6edf5a)\n\n## Improving the rolltop strap\n\nIn a photo by [/u/elliotpayne](https://www.reddit.com/user/elliottpayne) I saw a second G-hook attached to the rolltop closing strap. That is really ingenious as it allows to carry more than the Rhake is intended for: the rolltop is left open and the flap is secured by connecting the loop on top of the tablet compartment with the loop on the front of the rolltop flap (see photo).\n\n[An additional G-hook on the rolltop adjustment strap.](https://preview.redd.it/lcom5jg57xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a1dfeb7d25fc3b446ddd52b6922f3b0bddb8c65)\n\n## Cobra buckles\n\nI added 25mm Cobra buckles to the compression straps in the front. They don’t provide a functional benefit over the plastic Duraflex buckles but in my opinion they look great and have a nice handling as well as a great haptic. Opening them one-handedly is easy and silent. In some situations you can even close them one-handedly but most of the time that doesn’t work.\n\n[Carrying snowshoes on the outside of the Rhake. Straps with Cobra buckles.](https://preview.redd.it/49v1ln627xl21.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a884e92ec3f2520e7f14460734e10e41ebc56ee)\n\n## Fidlock V-buckles\n\nUPDATE: I changed back to Cobra buckles after a while. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MissionWorkshop/comments/amuz5i/an_indepth_look_at_the_mission_workshop_rhake/eifufmj/) for an explanation.\n\nAfter the Rhake VX was released I wanted to try out Fidlock buckles and ordered a pair of them together with so-called Triglide buckles. Attaching them to the straps wasn’t easy because the slot on the Fidlocks can’t really take a folded strap.  I managed to get them through eventually (although I had to use a pair of pliers), and now I hope I won’t have to ever get them off again. \n\nWhile I don’t like the looks of the Fidlock buckles as much as the Cobra buckles they do prove benefitial by allowing me to open/close them quickly with one hand. Lots of reviewers noted that they were a bit annoyed by having to undo compression straps whenever they want to get into one of the front pockets. With Fidlock buckles that has become a non-issue for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Afermarket Fidlock buckle on an HT500 Rhake.](https://preview.redd.it/l47ienhy6xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc7c8c18eb5139d1d8259c50a98837e247b8083f)\n\nFidlock buckles are very interesting due to their magnetic closing mechanism. For those of you wondering how they work on the Rhake I made a small video. Please keep in mind that I handle them a bit clumsily for the purposes of this video (it just shows better how they work).\n\n[Video of me clumsily handling Fidlock buckles on a Rhake.](https://reddit.com/link/amuz5i/video/k8b79xfb1fe21/player)\n\nI was asked whether it'd be possible to use a Fidlock buckle on the rolltop adjustment strap as well and I can't recommend it.\n\nFirst of all you either need a \"split bar\" V-Buckle in order to attach the female part to the loop on top of the tablet / front compartment, or you can simply saw the bar in half yourself. Secondly, due to the vertical orientation of the strap, the female part will often end up flipped-over making it more difficult to close the strap than with the g-hook.\n\n[Fidlock V-Buckle as rolltop closure.](https://preview.redd.it/pj8bdgtvike21.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856183115d29a8432099425c51de09715eb10846)\n\n# Lubricate the zippers\n\nZippers are the weak part of any backpack. I’d wager if there ever is a defect on a Mission Workshop backpack it’s probably a zipper having reached its end of life . They did on my Vandal.\n\nThe Rhake is a backpack with more zippers than usual. And what makes matters even more delicate is that the two front pocket zippers are going around a corner. I used teflon/PTFE bike lube on all the zippers and they flow more easily afterwards. That’s especially nice for the aforementioned pockets because they become easier to open and close.\n\n## Verdict\n\nFollowing the tao of essentialism, I’m really happy I bought the Rhake. It is a product that fills me with joy  whenever I use it and therefore I wouldn’t want to miss it. It is well made, durable, versatile and helps me keep my stuff organized and at hand. ",

They're no longer using VX-21 for their VX Rhakes, and probably no longer for any bag since this is also the same fabric they're using on the updated Spar VX versions.  \n\nI wonder what we'll see next? The return of the R6 with VX and side zip laptop compartment??  Maybe an updated Rambler/Vandal!?  The 'bigger' Rhake??  Maybe some smaller bag set ups that can actually utilize their detachable backpack strap (like the transit, or arkiv laptop sleeve)??",
