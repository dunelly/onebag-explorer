            "body": "So like the title says I left for Peru back in March right before the coronavirus epidemic happened. I was originally only supposed to be there for 3 weeks, but my three week trip turned into 7 months when the country went on lockdown. I could’ve got a repatriation flight home earlier but I was loving the time I was spending there and I intend on going back as soon as I can.\n\nI would just like to note here at the beginning that the picture is not the exact travel set up that I had upon leaving for Peru because some of my items became lost in travel and I just substituted what I had here in my house. (Specifically note the “titanium spork” that’s actually just a stainless steel spoon and my oversized white tube of toothpaste. Also a different water bottle than the one I started with.) That being said this is as close as I could get to my original set up and any item that was lost I included in the picture with a replacement for the sake of authenticity and reflection upon how I can improve my setup. \n\n**Packing List** \\- Items with a number next to it indicate to the corresponding number on the picture.\n\n**Bag**: \n\nTom Bihn Synapse 25 #1\n\n**Clothes (packing cube #6):**\n\n4 T shirts\n\n1 cotton long sleeve\n\n1 tank top\n\n6 underwear\n\n4 pairs small socks\n\n2 pair of wool socks #5\n\n1 pair of swim trunks\n\n1 pair of prana brion shorts\n\n1 pair of athletic shorts\n\n1 pair of bedrock cairn adventure sandals #22\n\n1 windbreaker #2\n\n**Clothing Worn (not pictured) :** \n\n1 Pair of prana brion pants\n\n1 cotton long sleeve shirt\n\n1 hooded flannel shirt\n\n1 pair of underwear\n\n1 arcade stretch belt\n\n1 pair of underwear\n\n1 pair of wool socks\n\nGlasses\n\n1 pair Merrel hiking boots\n\n**Toiletries (#4):**\n\nToothbrush\n\nToothpaste\n\nTongue Scraper\n\nFloss\n\nChap stick\n\nCuticle cream\n\nWet wipes\n\nIbuprofen &amp; aspirin\n\nQ tips\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\nEcoVessel Insulated Water Bottle #3\n\nQuickdry Microfiber towel #7\n\nGlasses Case #8\n\nHeadlamp #9\n\nMechanical Pencil #10\n\nMetal Straw #11\n\nTitanium Spork #12\n\nExternal Backup Battery #13\n\nJournal #14\n\nSpace pen #15\n\nPhone Charger Brick/USBC cord/micro USB cords #16\n\nPassport #17\n\nCash Wallet #18\n\nCard wallet #19\n\nMask #20\n\nHeadphones #21\n\nBedrock Sandals #22\n\nSmall egg maraca #23\n\nHand Sanitizer #24\n\n(Not Pictured) Phone: OnePlus 7\n\n**Things I purchased along the way**\n\nHoodie\n\nSweatpants\n\nSlide sandals\n\n**Things I would Change:**\n\nI’m going to break this down into two parts: a list of things that I would add to the setup and things that I would remove.\n\nThings To **ADD:**\n\n1. The first and foremost things I would’ve changed about my kit is I definitely would’ve added a hip belt and an internal frame sheet to my backpack. These are changes that I’m going to make to any backpack I buy in the future. A hip belt will help a lot to displace the weight off my shoulders which sometimes ended up hurting from bearing all the weight. And the internal frame sheet will help my bag keep its structure. It’s unfortunate to have to make these additions to an already expensive bag but I know it would be worth it in the long run for a more comfortable wearing experience. \n2. Something else that I added to my setup while I was in Peru was a fanny pack style waist bag. Initially I was keeping my passport, wallet and phone in the small pocket on the very front of my Synapse. However after some time I kind of got annoyed with constantly having to take off my backpack every time I needed access to one of these items, and so I bought a fanny pack. This turned out to be a great investment, I was able to put my phone, wallet, face mask, keys, cards, chapstick, lighter, and other small essential items in a much more easily accessible and frontal location on my body. Needless to say I’m now a big fan of the waistbag and will continue to rock it during my travels for the foreseeable future. \n3. Laptop - This item is an essential and was one of the only items that I consistently wished that I had with me while traveling but was too expensive to just buy when i already have one at home. I’m an aspiring digital nomad and have been actively trying to create income through the internet and having my laptop with me would’ve allowed me to work on that goal and other projects.\n4. A scrubba wash bag OR dry bag. While most of the places I was staying at had washing machines, the clothing I brought was too minimal to make a full load of laundry in a washing machine, even if all of it was dirty. I usually would wash my clothes in a plastic wash bin (these are very common in south america) with water, a pair of rubber gloves, and some soap. The scrubba would eliminate the need for me to use gloves, and find a plastic bin to wash my clothes in. I was thinking instead of the Scrubba wash bag I could instead just use a 20 L dry bag. This is an item that I already own and could probably use as a replacement to the scrubba. The only difference is that the scrubba has an air valve to release pressure and little nubs on the inside for scrubbing. I would prefer to have one of these as well for when I stay in hostels or places where the sinks aren’t very clean or sink laundry friendly. \n5. Flip flops. Just need that pair of casual footwear that’s easy to slip on and off for quick trips to the bathroom or chilling outside on warm nights. I ended up buying slides in Peru so that I could wear socks with the sandals at the same time but I prefer flip flops and will include them in my next set up.\n6. More toiletries. The toiletries kit I brought with me initially was pretty bare bones and covers all my basic needs, however in the future I definitely will be adding a few more cosmetic products to take better care of my skin and hair. \n7. A small piece of string to use as a clothesline to dry my clothes.\n8. I also ended up buying while I was in peru a heavy hooded sweatshirt and sweatpants for when it started transitioning to winter. The clothes I brought with me weren’t warm enough for when the weather started to change and the nights got cold.",

                "body": "Things to Eliminate:\n\n1. Water bottle: I carried an insulated metal water bottle for most of my trip and almost never used it. In Peru (and most developing countries) the water just isn’t safe to drink, so I was buying bottled water when I was on the move. To me it seemed like it was more trouble than it was worth to carry a metal bottle and it’s something I plan on eliminating from my setup. The water bottle I brought with me I actually lost after only a few days of being back in the states after carrying it around and not using it for months. Oh well, I didn’t use it anyway.\n2. Glasses Case - I just didn’t use it, I put my glasses on a shelf at night. \n3. Journal - I wrote in my journal initially but eventually I ended up just using a notes app on my phone more than anything else and I stopped journaling. I’m not the kind of guy to sit down and log pages and pages of writing in a journal at one time. Most of the time I just ended up using my phone to take quick notes the moment something would come to mind, or use a voice recorder app for more stream of consciousness style recordings.\n4. Titanium Spork - I carried a titanium spork for several months while I was traveling but barely used it. I won’t be carrying utensils in my bag anymore.\n5. Metal Straw - Same story as the spork. I used the straw for a few weeks stretch when I was making fresh squeezed orange juice every morning and I was drinking it through a straw in an effort to save my enamel. Other than this however I really didn’t use it that much at all and will be eliminating it from my setup.\n\n**Things I liked about the Synapse 25**\n\nIncredibly well made - This thing really is built for life. The materials are incredibly durable and very high quality. The stitching is incredibly well done as well. All around a very, very solid construction. This was my main bag for 7 months and it doesn’t show any signs of wear. \n\nSuper Beefy Aquaguard Zippers\n\nWater Bottle Pocket - Even though I’m going to eliminate a water bottle from my carry and a dedicated water bottle pocket will no longer be necessary, I thought that the placement of this pocket was really nice and well thought out. Being placed in the center of the bag was great, the weight distribution was nice. It didn't throw off my balance or anything.\n\nThe final thing that I really liked about the Synapse was that after I unpacked my packing cube in the hostel, I was ready to use the synapse as a day bag, which it actually worked incredibly well for.\n\n**Things I don't like about the synapse 25**\n\nToo Many Pockets - while initially I thought that it would be great to have a backpack with a lot of pockets (because I LOVE organization) after traveling with this bag I found them to be superfluous and unnecessary. The items that I ended up putting in the two wing flap pockets on the side never needed to be accessed that quickly to the point where they needed a dedicated pocket. I’m certain that I’d be able to pack a backpack with less pockets in such a way that everything i need would be accessible.\n\nThe Shape - This goes hand in hand with the excessive pockets thing, but I am going to try out a bag with a more rectangular and less complicated shape. I think i could easily pack out an Aeronaut 30 (or other similarly shaped bag) much, much more efficiently than a 25 liter synapse. The main compartment of the synapse didn’t allow for much more than my one packing cube, a couple pairs of socks, and my journal. The space on the front of the bag with the two wing pockets made it convenient for me to reach the items that I carried in that space, but like I said earlier were RARELY necessary for me to quickly access the items that were in those pockets.\n\nThe Main Compartment - The main compartment is fairly large and spacious but it was a pain in the butt to take my packing cube in and out of. Tom Bihn has since fixed this problem with the full clamshell designs of the Synik series, however I didn’t think it would be that big of a deal with the Synapse. I was wrong. Every time I wanted to take something out of my packing cube in the main compartment, I would have to basically unpack everything, retrieve what I need, and then repack the whole thing. This obviously wasn’t that big of a deal when I was staying somewhere for a while and could unpack my whole bag. But there were many nights when I was staying in a hostel for only a night, or when I was sleeping on a friends couch, and I would only need one thing out of my bag only to have to take everything out of it and repack it.\n\n**My Next Bag**\n\nWhile Synapse worked well for this trip, it definitely wasn’t ideal and I plan on making a lot of changes to my future set up. My next bag is going to be something that has more of a rectangular or square shape, which will allow me to more effectively and efficiently utilize all of the space in the bag. It’s going to have far fewer pockets, I think that a few large main compartments and some organizer cubes would work even better than having a million tiny and specialized pockets. I will also be opting for a larger bag with a larger main compartment that has a greater ease of access for my packing cubes. I want a bag that has a full clamshell opening, or a spacious duffel style opening that will allow me to live out of the bag with greater ease when I’m couch surfing or staying somewhere for only one night. A slightly larger bag will also allow me much greater flexibility. I would much prefer to have a larger bag that is not completely packed out so that I have a little extra space to reorganize, or add an extra item or article of clothing that I might acquire in my travels. My next bag will also definitely include a hip belt and internal frame sheet. \n\nI think that I’m going to go for the Aeronaut 30 as my next bag and outfit it for indefinite travel. I really much preferred living in South America and I’m thinking that in the next few months I will be selling my car and leaving to travel indefinitely by bicycle in Peru and Colombia.\n\nSo that’s pretty much it. This was my first time one-bagging and I’m really excited to create a more efficient and comfortable set up. Thoughts, comments and suggestions are very welcome.",
