Your picture is quite misleading, because it does not show the main compartment's curvage caused by the back system. I am pretty sure none of the Futures features a laptop compartment, there is a separator for hydration bladders and that's it.",

I absolutely loved it, but the only thing was that the bag was rather heavy (but then it was pretty old).\n\nI need to size up to around 30L, so I can carry things for others too, and would like a zip top for quick access and a side water bottle holder, but apart from that I'm not too worried.  (Good looks are always appreciated, though.)\n\nLooking around, these are the options I have found so far:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Name|Size/l|Weight/g|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Gregory Citro|30|948|\n|Deuter Airlite|28|1030|\n|Thule Capstone|32|1160|\n|Gregory Salvo|28|1180|\n|Gregory Zulu|30|1240|\n|Osprey Manta|34|1400|\n|Osprey Stratos|34|1400|\n\n\nNow the standout one here is the Gregory Citro, but that seems rather suspicious to me.  It’s essentially very similar to the Gregory Salvo but with an additional hydration reservoir pocket, yet is supposedly over 200g *lighter*.   Am I missing something?\n\nHas anyone here got any experience with the Citro, or any of the others for that matter?\n\nAre there any that I have missed?  I know there are a lot of specialist ultralight manufacturers out there, but I haven't found any with a trampoline style back panel.\n\nThanks in advance.",

(\"Kira\" and \"Lumiere\" both mean \"light\".)\n\nNobility are people like Finral Roulacase and Langris Vaude; Gauche and Marie Adlai; William Vangeance; Julius Novachrono; Henry Legolant; Klaus Lunettes, etc. I could name them all, but a majority are in Golden Dawn.\n\nCommoners are a step above peasants. Luck is a commoner, but has mana sensing abilities on par of that of nobles. \n\nPeasants are what Yuno and Asta are called throughout the series due to being from the Forsaken Realm, which is where the elves lived. \n\nI have a turned version of the map (I get aggravated at this map all the time for being on its side) so that its pointed due north.",

Have tried on the 28 and 18 and both back panels fit my back. I tend to be the family Sherpa for a family of 3. On my Northface I never use my waist straps. When hiking I am 50/50 with waist straps. But, the MH Fluid 26 has no real structure and I always felt if it did it would be a better pack and less need for tight waist straps. \n\nHeaded to Mexico soon, Disneyland in the fall, and have a bit of hiking planned for summer. Going to order one today. Please weigh in! ",

I would wholeheartedly recommend the waist strap version.\n\nMy Osprey Manta 34 is perfect for me as EDC. I usually tighten the compression straps to make it really flat and when i need to put more stuff in it, there is always room and I never feel like I am carrying much because of the proper waist strap. It also allowes you to control even more how sweaty on a warm day your shoulders/back become if you loosen the shoulder straps.\n\nThe only downside in my opinion are the plastic buckles laying on the floor when you put the pack down as you might accidentally step on them. My solution is to tighten them close to the waist belt when I am not using the waist belt at all.\n\nLast benefit: You get an extra pocket (and a open top mesh pocket on the other side). Put there something that you always have with you but dont use often so you always know where it is (for example medical equipment for emergencies).",

I figure if it can manage 12 hrs plus in Disneyland without thought of the waist strap then it should easily handle a 2-15 mile hike as those loads are about the same weight for me.
