I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

            "body": "Just picked up a used Rains Mountaineer backpack   ([https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag](https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag)) in very good condition, and wanted to post some pics and thoughts on the bag since I couldn't find much more info online. I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

            "body": "Just picked up a used Rains Mountaineer backpack   ([https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag](https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag)) in very good condition, and wanted to post some pics and thoughts on the bag since I couldn't find much more info online. I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks.

            "body": "Just picked up a used Rains Mountaineer backpack   ([https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag](https://www.rains.com/products/mountaineer-bag)) in very good condition, and wanted to post some pics and thoughts on the bag since I couldn't find much more info online. I was looking for a new bike commuting bag for work and wanted something rainproof, self standing, and that had one big bucket with a top lid access. Also was looking for minimalist styling, decent price, and good enough organization. Ideally it would be expandable so that I could also grab groceries on the way home, or pack a change of clothes, but didn't want to go with a rolltop or a bag that needed a rain cover, so I gave up on expandability for now. \n\nThe pics above show some more details on the bag and what I was able to pack in. I haven't ridden in rain yet, so will update after a few weeks of use.\n\nAside from the info you find on the product website, here are some more thoughts:\n\n* Weighs 0.9kg\n* The 3 outer pockets can fit a whole hand, but the side one is really hard to open and access.\n* The elastic webbing on the front works really well to hold a jacket - I wouldn't worry that it would fall out during a bike commute.\n* The water bottle holder is big and sticks out and aesthetically bugs me but should hold any size bottle just fine without cutting into the bag's volume\n* Top access flap doesn't stay open on its own\n* Inner liner is a soft woven black material, can be hard to see down into the bottom, no softer material for the laptop sleeve\n* There's a small hand sized open pocket in addition to the laptop pocket inside.\n* The laptop sleeve fits a thick 15inch laptop, but it's tight. 17inch would be a no go. Also, the laptop compartment goes all the way down to the bottom of the bag in case you worry about that sort of thing.Inside I was able to fit my laptop, a small packing cube with charger and accessories, some bike tools, water bottle, big headphones, shoes, and a patagonia better sweater jacket\n* It's unclear to me how ''waterproof'' a bag needs to be for rain to not leak into the bag. The material here is waterproof enough, but I'm not sure if the seems are sealed, but also not sure if they need to be. Guess I'll find out\n* All the zippers are aquaguard type, and the pockets are also covered by flaps, or has a zipper garage\n* Not sure how this will hold up over time. It seems more like a design focused bag than a tough, last forever bag.  Not that it doesn't feel robust.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from this bag, I was looking at:\n\n* Very waterproof rolltops with no self stand or side access or ''enough'' exterior pockets (f.eks. Silva Orbit 360, fjallraven ulvo 23 rolltop)\n* Bags with unclear rainproofness (Thule Paramount 24L, TNF Kaban, Millican Oli the zip - it was unclear if either would be ok for a long time out in the rain),\n* Self standing bags (Black diamond creek transit 22 and 32, mountain hardware camp 4 and grotto, fjallraven singi 20) but the waterproofness was unclear and the sizing felt either too small or too big.\n* Chrome Bravo 3.0, Yalta 3.0, and Volcan, but they all had one element that didn't work each (rolltop but no side access, rolltop and side access with no self stand, design was too boxy).\n* Osprey Radial (self standing, expandable, not waterproof but come with rain cover compartment), but just felt too similar to the hiking bag I usually use.\n* Timbuk2 tech rolltop I think met all my requirements, but was just expensive (at least where I live)",

        "selftext": "Hey folks!\n\nHappy to share my first post - but my 4th rolltop. \n \nMaterials:\n- 1000d Cordura (exterior)\n- X-pac VX21 (interior)\n- YKK coil zipper 5C + aquaguard\n- Fidlock snap buckles\n- EVA foam EV50\n- webbing attachment\n- cam buckle\n- 3d mesh\n- mesh\n\nSewing machine: Sailrite lsz-1\n\nFeatures:\nFront:\n- front pocket with 5 separate compartments\n- MOLLE system\nRight side: \n- expandable pocket for umbrella or water bottle\nLeft side:\n- pocket for glasses - sewn at an angle to leave more room for the hand\nBack:\n- hidden pocket for passport, credit card and airtag\n- laptop pocket\n- suitcase strap\n- removable sternum strap\n\nSourcing websites:\n- tacticaltrim.de\n- extremtextil.de\n- tissusactifs.fr\n\n(I'm French ;)) \n\nHere are the points of improvement I noted:\n\n- the lining is too thick (VX21).\n-&gt; I should find a finner X-pac fabric\n- Cordura 1000D is too heavy.\n-&gt; let's try with a lighter fabric: any idea? \n- the rolltop zipper is too long, which breaks the shape of the bag when folded down.\n-&gt; reduce the rolltop zipper size to the front width\n- the laptop pocket zipper cover yawns due to rolltop tension.\n-&gt; put more EVA foam to keep the shape\n- the expandable water bottle pocket is starting to warp.\n-&gt; I'm thinking of adding elastics on both sides of the pocket to reduce tension.\n\nFeel free to share your feedback ;)\nI plan to sew another backpack in upcoming months.\n\nThanks for reading!\nCheers",

I've tried their VX21 RS Soft and whilst it is more pliable than standard VX21 its still quite a bit stiffer than normal 210D PU coated. Also X-Pac seems a bit overkill for a lining but to each their own!\n\nDo you choose the Cordura because you want it to be extra rugged? If not you could look at VX21 or EcoPak 200 as an outer perhaps.\n\nI like the space mesh hidden pocket at the base of the bag!",

Anything that I missed that could make the construction tougher?\n- Any features missing that would make the pack more convenient for daily use?",

I initially ruled it out, thinking that I will only use it occasionally and it somewhat ruins the minimal look. Now, thanks you your comment, I think I found a solutions (similar to the internal straps) that will not affect the design.",

            "body": "Hey all!\n\nI wanted to share this latest pack of mine. This is maybe my \\~12th backpack; most are backpacking oriented but a few are for daily use. For this one, I wanted a commuting backpack with a slightly asymmetric design that doesn't draw attention. There's a few design features that I think are worth sharing:\n\n* Probably the feature I'm most proud of is the the flap closure. It's guided with a few magnets and a Fidlock fastener that lets the flap \"snap\" close with gravity. There's are two male parts attached to the body, one of which is an adjustable slider that's kept in place using hook and loop. You can see how this works in the second pic.\n* The backpack straps are removable using using 2\" aluminum tri-glides that interlocks with 2\" plastic loops. Keeping the straps modular lets me iterate on different strap designs independently of rest of the pack. At this point I've iterated enough on my straps where they now fit my body quite nicely.\n* There's a modular laptop sleeve that's attached to the back using hook and loop. Again, keeping things modular lets me reuse components between projects.\n* This is a tiny detail, but there are carrying handles on both the exterior and interior of the backpack, so you can easily carry it with the flap open.\n* Finally, I added a wrap-around zipper which is typically used for side access but can open the backpack fully.\n\nThe exterior fabric is 70D vinyl-coated nylon with what I think is the wrong side facing out which has a slightly off-black color. Interior fabric is oxford fabric, which I like as a \"general use\" fabric because it's easy to handle and not too stiff.\n\nLike my other projects, I design my patterns using python code within a jupyter notebook. If you're curious, I shared a few more details on this process scattered [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/107vdrl/large_8ish_person_group_tent_for_offroad/).\n\nSince making the pack it's been my daily driver for both work and travel across multiple countries. One that that didn't go as planned was the 2mm foam reinforcements I sewed into the pack; it was a lot extra work and, in practice, too flimsy to add any extra structure. I probably could have just excluded it for the same effect. Other than that, I've been pretty happy with the results!",

            "body": "Hey all!\n\nI wanted to share this latest pack of mine. This is maybe my \\~12th backpack; most are backpacking oriented but a few are for daily use. For this one, I wanted a commuting backpack with a slightly asymmetric design that doesn't draw attention. There's a few design features that I think are worth sharing:\n\n* Probably the feature I'm most proud of is the the flap closure. It's guided with a few magnets and a Fidlock fastener that lets the flap \"snap\" close with gravity. There's are two male parts attached to the body, one of which is an adjustable slider that's kept in place using hook and loop. You can see how this works in the second pic.\n* The backpack straps are removable using using 2\" aluminum tri-glides that interlocks with 2\" plastic loops. Keeping the straps modular lets me iterate on different strap designs independently of rest of the pack. At this point I've iterated enough on my straps where they now fit my body quite nicely.\n* There's a modular laptop sleeve that's attached to the back using hook and loop. Again, keeping things modular lets me reuse components between projects.\n* This is a tiny detail, but there are carrying handles on both the exterior and interior of the backpack, so you can easily carry it with the flap open.\n* Finally, I added a wrap-around zipper which is typically used for side access but can open the backpack fully.\n\nThe exterior fabric is 70D vinyl-coated nylon with what I think is the wrong side facing out which has a slightly off-black color. Interior fabric is oxford fabric, which I like as a \"general use\" fabric because it's easy to handle and not too stiff.\n\nLike my other projects, I design my patterns using python code within a jupyter notebook. If you're curious, I shared a few more details on this process scattered [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/107vdrl/large_8ish_person_group_tent_for_offroad/).\n\nSince making the pack it's been my daily driver for both work and travel across multiple countries. One that that didn't go as planned was the 2mm foam reinforcements I sewed into the pack; it was a lot extra work and, in practice, too flimsy to add any extra structure. I probably could have just excluded it for the same effect. Other than that, I've been pretty happy with the results!",

It looks like it would be easy to do with one hand and with minimal \"finagling\". \n\nCould you go into some more details on how you used the python notebook for a backpack. The links and previous notebook seem centred on curvature for poles -- and it seems like you might be parametrically generating the patterns in python from your description?",

        "selftext": "A recentish onebag traveller that has made do with insufficient bags until stumbling upon this community. \n\nFound my perfect travel bag in the Patagonia Terravia 28l. There’s very little out there review wise or anything on Reddit about this pack, so thought it might be useful to chuck my thoughts out there. \n\nFor starters, the dimensions on Patagonia’s website are wildly wrong. They’re listed as 58.4 x 29.2 x 26.7 cm whereas I packed this bag with the packing list in the comments, and easily cinched the bag to the dimensions of 46x24x22 cm (18x9x8 inches)which are only just barely over the threshold for EasyJet and other budget airlines, and certainly not big enough to warrant unnecessary scrutiny at the gate. With that being said, I think it’s still easy to squish and manoeuvre the bag to fit the sizers, as long as you haven’t packed it to the absolute gills. \n\nWhy I think it’s great: I love having one big cavernous section, as I do my own organisation. With this being a top loader, and a fairly narrow opening, packing cubes will be your friend, but not essential. You really do feel like you’re maximising every centimetre of the bag’s capacity with this one big compartment. There is a small internal zip pouch big enough for passport + phone + battery pack, a thin laptop/tablet/hydration sleeve within, a front drop pocket, two water bottle side pockets, plus a decent sized zipped pocket on the lid. However, for the purposes of cinching down to a compatible size, might be worth leaving that lid pocket empty, at least for the exact moment you would need to put it into a sizer. \n\nIt’s light at just under 800g, incredibly comfortable with a nice hip belt and sternum strap, and it comes with an included rain cover with its own separate stash pocket at the foot of the bag, which is obviously great for rain protection during hikes or transit, but also as a way to keep the bag clean on dirty under-seat plane floors and as theft prevention. \n\nThe top loading style might not be to everyone’s taste, and the strap to fasten the lid closure is unnecessarily long, which could frustrate some. Personally I don’t mind, as it can easily be tucked away into the front drop pocket, or even cut off, and using the front drop pocket clasp to fasten the lid. \n\nAs mentioned above, I fit a week’s worth of winter clothes packed into this bag and it fit the dimensions listed above. Summer packing would be lighter I’d imagine, hence trying the winter list, but YMMV.  \n\nOverall I’m really impressed by this bag, and can’t wait to utilise this a lot over the coming years. Hopefully this review can give people some of the answers that I myself was looking for in my bag search. ",

Preferable looking for something 20+ litres and in a black colourway, my budget is under £130\n\nfor local travels it'd just be laptop, books, papers, electronics such as headphones and maybe some comfy slippers. I did look at the previous two brands (mentioned above) but I'm not too sure on their long term durability and if they're just a brand that look nice and will fall apart after a year or two.\n\nThank you for taking your time to respond!\n\n",

        "selftext": "Hi there 😁 I'm currently looking for a backpack that will last (atleast 5 years) Which seems like a long time compared to the bags ive gotten in the past. but to be fair i didnt dish out too much on them, so i guess it worth doing a one time splash on a good bag that'll last\n\nI quite like the designs of the (stubble and co) backpacks and the (rains) roll top backpacks.\n\nId use it for work that (sometimes) can be taken on sites and a little dirty and roughed up but not too often and international flights. Preferable looking for something 20+ litres and in a black colourway, my budget is under £130\n\nfor local travels it'd just be laptop, books, papers, electronics such as headphones and maybe some comfy slippers. I did look at the previous two brands (mentioned above) but I'm not too sure on their long term durability and if they're just a brand that look nice and will fall apart after a year or two.\n\nThank you for taking your time to respond!\n\n",

I use the dry bag to slide into it but always end up stuffing some extra things inside the outer bag around the dry bag and strapping some little things to the outside of it. I know it would be hard to cover given the way these bags attach to the seat and seatpost but I would think someone would have figured it out and be using or selling something that would work (maybe something like a long shower cap?). I also attached a couple pictures so please feel free to comment on/critique my setup; always looking for some good gear info :).",

I've seen plenty of reviews and experiences of the regular rolltop, but none for the Buckle variant. The Buckle rolltop is seemingly a little bit bigger, has an alternative closing mechanism (two (plastic) buckles rather than a single (metal) centered clip), but does not have the separate laptop component accessible through the side. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with the Buckle variant (or perhaps with both) and can tell me a bit about their experience? Any overall advice?",

        "selftext": "We were in the UK (London -&gt; Salisbury -&gt; Cardiff -&gt; London) or 7 days (6 scheduled, but with flight delay it ended up being 7 days), and here is how I packed my [Stubble&amp;Co 15L Roll Top backpack](https://www.stubbleandco.com/products/the-roll-top-15l?variant=42549412167909) and what I had on me.\n\nOn me:  \nUnderpants, Socks, Chino, T-Shirt, Quechua Hybrid Jacket, New Balance 990v6\n\nIn Bag:\n\nClothing:  \nPeak Design Packing Cube Small  \n1x Shorts  \n2x T-Shirt  \n4x Underpants, Socks\n\nTech:  \nAirPods Pro 2  \nMiniX 65W Power Supply (with the UK Adapter on it)  \nLighting and USB C Cable  \nAnker Nano Powerbank\n\nWashing:  \nCut Toothbrush  \n10ml Toothpaste  \nFloss  \n10ml Containers with Deo and Hair Gel  \nQ-Tips and Toothpicks  \nLip Balm\n\nMisc:  \nBars, Chewing Gum  \nPassport  \nZip-Lock Bags  \nTissues\n\nAs you can see, thanks to being able to wash clothes during the trip, even the 15 Liter bag was only half full. But at least I was able to put the jacket in on the warm days, and still had some space for snacks and a water bottle. And the jacket was more than enough, even on the colder days with about 5℃ in the morning hours.\n\nThis was my first long trip with this Backpack, and I'm pretty happy with it. I bought this as an Upgrade from my Quechua NH500 23L Roll Top, which I already used for 6 days in Canada and things like that. The only thing, which I still miss a bit, is the quick-access Zipper for the Roll-Top. But I can still live with it, and the build quality and carrying system of the Stubble&amp;Co is really better, and the size fits me better. But the Quechua was still used by my girlfriend, and she was very happy with it, and couldn't believe how much she could fit in it.\n\nI'm a dedicated One-Bag traveller since about two years, so I have my setup pretty much optimized, with little room for improvement. Of course I could shave off some grams by using more expensive Merino wool things, but this would only lead to my GF putting more snacks in my backpack to carry, so the benefit is negligible :D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1575ovk3f7pd1.jpg?width=5712&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fad94ac2f7d0d064966655bc8b4dddea7edad5b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofcmrvk3f7pd1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19f4d063973a61329837f447a05588ad035aec3b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rj25xvk3f7pd1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1c3d59268838bc6788a0df5f3633bbb23bd7e57\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/feiamvk3f7pd1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5ab9c782b6e0b015ef89b3d082f6d893ed71a956\n\n",

My issue isn't that the bags aren't totally waterproof, it's mostly the way they portray it on their website. From their [why not waterproof page](https://www.bedrockbags.com/why-not-waterproof) \"“On this particular day in early September it rained for around 6 hours straight and my sleep  system and mobile phone inside them were bone dry!” -Steve B., Scotland\n\n\"Wanted to let you know the bags worked great... I did a 58-mile overnighter last weekend, 95% singletrack, a dozen creek crossings, and it rained for the first 4 hours of our ride.  Everything stayed rock solid on the bike, and just about completely dry despite the conditions we rode through... Thanks!\" -Jason R., Georgia\n\nWe are often asked whether our bags are completely waterproof.  Almost all the materials and closures we use are waterproof (frame bag zippers included), but our bags are sewn products, because sewing textiles is the strongest way to build a bag.  Under heavy rain events (or submersion), you may see some dampness in our bags.\"\n\nMy experience leads me to feel severely misled by the testimonials. The reality is that the bags need to be detached from the bike and drained frequently on rainy days, otherwise you end up carrying several liters of extra water around.",

            "body": "Designer at Cedaero packs here (Minnesota). Waterproof vs water resistant is something that comes up almost daily around our shop. Any pack without sealed seams will have some water intrusion when submerged/in extreme wet conditions, so the game becomes water management. While some fully sealed dry bags are a great option for some applications, when they fail and let water in, they don’t let the water out either and are more difficult to dry. We’ve had success using three layers on the panels of our packs: 1000D Cordura —&gt; 1/8” closed-cell foam —&gt; 200D Cordura liner. Even though our seams aren’t sealed, they are fully bound inside and it takes a lot to force water through them. The Cordura is water resistant to 200psi so unless they’re submerged, even heavy rain won’t wick through the fabric like with some laminates. Personally, I keep the stuff that really can’t get wet in its own dry bag/ziplock inside my packs for comfort and peace of mind. I’m still learning what does and doesn’t work like everyone else, but I have spent a fair bit of time in the pack making realm, so AMA if you’re curious",

            "body": "That's a bummer at that price point but looking at their website, I'd say they were cagey. \"Highly weather-resistant roll-top closure using waterproof materials\" is marketing mumbo jumbo that insinuates waterproof but it isn't. \n\nLooking at them, there's too much stitching that doesn't look sealed and it seems they're using xpac21, which is great, but not waterproof. It'll survive a quick shower but not rain. (I have it on several bags and I know to Ziploc stuff). They might work in Utah or Colorado but I'd never use these in a place that rain rains. It's a shame, they look awesome in design. Probably need a dry bag though, which defeats the purpose.\n\nRe Bikepacking.com, yeah, it does seem to just shill products now. Nothing sucks. It's the whole ethos of everything is great in bikepacking. Hopefully it doesn't get swallowed by equity like several other sites such as cyclingtips. That being said, rider rigs is awesome.",

            "body": "I have the original version. It's super lightweight when empty. Loads and unloads easily (but I mostly use cubes/pouches), but it is a black void so visibility is poor internally. I love the look and the waterproofing is incredible with UK rain. \n\nIt is small though - I use it only for a budget airline, Loganair, with very tight baggage dimensions and I pair it with a 8L sling. It's also very \"crinkly\" - it looks, feels and sounds like a waterproof stuff sack or a tarp, because that's basically what it is - so that's not for everyone. Straps have a really nice s-curve and are very comfortable. It sits very well on a smaller frame (5ft6\" F).\n\nIt's lovely if you want the small size or waterproofing, but if those aren't key considerations it might not be what you need. It also supports a shoulder strap pouch if you want one for passport carry in airports (eg Matador speed cache, the Chrome pouch) but I found the Matador clunky and returned it in favour of a sling.",
