The weeks leading up to the trip seemed a lot warmer than I was anticipating, and it was for the first half of my trip. \n\n\nThe first photo is what I packed, and the second is what I would have omitted instead, and included the items I used the most. I also had a PJ t shirt and light pants, 6x socks and 6x underwear with laundry in the middle of the trip. I brought a bra and a swim top (which I ended up not wearing)\n\n\nI also included my daily outfits with weather and activity lol. I was glad to bring the sandals since we spent time in the Sahara, and I could have definitely done without the boots as it wasn’t super rainy in London. My jeans stretched out to the point where they looked ridiculous, and felt uncomfortable to wear. Reminds me why I don’t usually pack denim.\n\n\nA lot of your posts have helped me get to this point so hopefully this helps someone out there!!",

I also had a PJ t shirt and light pants, 6x socks and 6x underwear with laundry in the middle of the trip. I brought a bra and a swim top (which I ended up not wearing)\n\n\nI also included my daily outfits with weather and activity lol. I was glad to bring the sandals since we spent time in the Sahara, and I could have definitely done without the boots as it wasn’t super rainy in London. My jeans stretched out to the point where they looked ridiculous, and felt uncomfortable to wear. Reminds me why I don’t usually pack denim.\n\n\nA lot of your posts have helped me get to this point so hopefully this helps someone out there!!",

The weeks leading up to the trip seemed a lot warmer than I was anticipating, and it was for the first half of my trip. \n\n\nThe first photo is what I packed, and the second is what I would have omitted instead, and included the items I used the most. I also had a PJ t shirt and light pants, 6x socks and 6x underwear with laundry in the middle of the trip. I brought a bra and a swim top (which I ended up not wearing)\n\n\nI also included my daily outfits with weather and activity lol. I was glad to bring the sandals since we spent time in the Sahara, and I could have definitely done without the boots as it wasn’t super rainy in London. My jeans stretched out to the point where they looked ridiculous, and felt uncomfortable to wear.

I also had a PJ t shirt and light pants, 6x socks and 6x underwear with laundry in the middle of the trip. I brought a bra and a swim top (which I ended up not wearing)\n\n\nI also included my daily outfits with weather and activity lol. I was glad to bring the sandals since we spent time in the Sahara, and I could have definitely done without the boots as it wasn’t super rainy in London. My jeans stretched out to the point where they looked ridiculous, and felt uncomfortable to wear.

They need to be able to build the pack (sew it together) and then insert the metal frame afterward and a zipper is a really easy solution.  It's not intended to be opened up by the user so that's why it doesn't have a tab on the zipper.   Its a pretty clever and simple trick for assembly when you think about it",

Personally I'd probably just keep and use the Porter 30 and just have a larger personal item bag to go with it. A tote, sling, crossbody that is max size for a personal item like a Osprey Daylite Tote, Patagonia Black Hole Tote, Mystery Ranch Market, Mystery Ranch District Pro or District 8, North Face Voyager Sling, etc.",

So are you saying I would use the Porter 30 as the cabin bag and bring a similarly sized personal item? Not a bad idea. \n\nI have been struggling with the tote recently because it slips off my arm and two backpacks doesn’t work. Any idea on either how to get it to work crossbody or a crossbody of similar capacity and packability?",

But I also have a potential job offer that will involve frequent trips to Kenya. I anticipate needing a bit more space than my standard and well-loved Osprey Porter 30 that onebag frequently with. I like the under the radar look of the REI Trail 40 but it would mean buying another bag. I already own the Flash 45 which would of course not work under seat, but on all these international flights a cabin bag would be included in my ticket price. But it does scream backpacker and not 40+ professional. I've never been to africa and looking for recommendations  on which bag to get/use.",
