        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacks/comments/1hsyjz7/black_ember_forge_40_max_first_impressions/",
        "selftext": "Just got this a few days ago and a few initial thoughts might be helpful to those considering it.\n\nFirst things first, I guess, is to say that my previous backpack is a cheap mostly generic, tech centered backpack from a no name Chinese brand I got from Amazon over a decade ago. Above average compartments/features but little actual consideration for useability and materials.\n\nRight off the gate, my first impression was that it is taller (in backpack orientation) and boxier than I expected. But also doesn't actually look oversized on me - when wearing it. \n\nThe materials are really good. No PFAS is a plus and it looks extremely durable, heavily water resistant and not too prone to collecting lint and dust particles like the Forge 30 apparently does, according to what I've gathered online. Although, with the texture being  weave like (tightly knit but weave nonetheless) it'll probably need the occasional dust off. The handles are made of seatbelt style material (I'm assuming polyester) along with the compression straps.

From what I've gathered, thought, that's a general issues with YKK Aquaguard.\n\n I've seen people posting online about the weight. Although quite noticeable when carrying it by hand, in briefcase mode, they've actually done a great job with the shoulder straps. So much so that I'm actually surprised how light it feels on the shoulders. For reference, I've used the backpack with the content in the fourth picture. A modern gaming laptop, with accompanying brick, mouse, headphones, book, 500ml water bottle and power bank. All adding up to about 7kg (about 15/16 pounds) with the backpack. All of this with barely any stress and before sitting down to adjust the load lifters to my liking.\n\nErgonomics, in general, are a plus. The briefcase handles feel sturdy and don't protrude much when in backpack mode. The shoulder straps are nicely contoured and neither chafe the neck nor sit too wide, putting weight on the shoulder joints. That's quite a feat for someone with quite a wide neck and sloping shoulders. Access and compartmentalisation is easy and well thought out. \n\nA note on ergonomics to keep in mind is that on the go use of the quick access compartment is easier when swivelling it over your right shoulder rather than left because the zipper is slightly off centre. \n\nPockets are well considered and plentiful, with the new compartments (compared to the Forge 30) quite useful and extra quick access compartments. They perfectly fit Black Ember's Boarding Kit and there's one on each side (top-down in backpack mode, left-right in briefcase). Laptop compartment is split into 3 sleeves and is side accessed.\n\nA slight quibble is the top handle that has barely any stretch to fit your hand under. Not that big of a deal, though, with all the other ways to carry it.\n\nMost everything goes into the quick access pockets. Book, power bank, notebooks, pens and extra compression straps going into the central zipper. Mouse, chunky power brick and cables going first into the Boarding Kit and then into the bottom compartment - and headphones on the top quick access. The laptop goes in its dedicated place, along with the occasional papers - and the main compartment is saved for a light jacket and random use cases. I've also got the Water Bottle Holder that goes on top for now but supposedly also straps into the bottom but haven't had the time to look into it.\n\nThe reason I went for the 40 over the 30 is mainly for the laptop. It's a 16 inch screen on a gaming chassis. Which in 2024 (2025 now) means a wider, 16:10 display and air vents protruding out the back. It's a good thing I did too. Although it fits comfortably with some room to spare, the zippers don't open completely over the available space and any smaller and it wouldn't fit through without push and pulling on the zipper too much for my taste.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions. I'm sure this post ended up me rambling quite a bit but still with things I've missed. ",

Couldn't imagine using it as a daily though.\n\nI haven't seen the aquaguard flake issue on any of my black ember bags but definitely on some other bags, and that includes the Citadel with 2 years of daily use.

I'm shopping on the local marketplace and the Riutbag is cheaper by about US$50, with the Nomatic being half the price of the Tortuga and Riutbag.\n\n___\n\nHey all, now that things are stabilizing across the world, I'm in the market for a travel backpack!\n\nI have:\n\n* Incase [Two-Way Convertible Brief](https://www.carryology.com/sponsored/is-this-the-perfect-convertible-bag-for-work-and-everyday/) for work situations\n\n* Bellroy Venture Sling 6L for EDC. I also use it as an organizer for the Incase\n\nI'm trying to keep my bag wardrobe as lean as I can, so this bag would be part of a lineup for:\n\n* One-bag travel or two-bag travel, for shorter trips\n\n* EDC and/or bringing a laptop into office\n\nAs a nice-to-have, I'm also ideally looking to replace my Incase, so something that can convert to a briefcase mode would be great. I know in many cases it's not going to look as sleek as a real briefcase, so it's all good as long as it doesn't look straight-up like a backpack on its side!\n\nHere are the options I'm considering for travel and work, in order of preference:\n\n**[Tortuga Setout Divide](https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/tortuga/setout-divide-backpack/)**\n\nPros:\n\n* Expandable (26L to 34L)\n\n* Can be converted into a messenger, maybe even a briefcase if I'm okay with the weight. It's not going to look great on the side facing my body with the huge ventilation channels, but the one facing outside looks fairly symmetrical and clean enough for a quick visit to the client's office\n\n* Overall, looks like a great, simple backpack that can also expand and has a messenger mode without anything overly fancy\n\nCons:\n\n* Not waterproof\n\n* Going to be nitpicking here, but 26L could be a little too big for EDC, but that then does carve out a nice niche for my Bellroy Venture Sling which is currently taking the EDC spot\n\n[**Nomatic Travel Pack**](https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/nomatic/travel-pack-4/)\n\nPros:\n\n* Expandable (20L to 30L)\n\n* Better for EDC than the Tortuga\n\n* Very specific to my situation, but this is available for half the price used on the local marketplace! The only reason this is ahead of the Riutbag\n\n* More water-resistant than the Tortuga\n\nCons:\n\n* Fits lesser than the Tortuga\n\n* As with every other Nomatic bag, the use of Tarpaulin makes me think this bag will not last as long\n\n**[Riutbag X35](https://www.riut.co.uk/collections/choose-your-riutbag-secure-laptop-backpack/products/riutbag-x35-black-large-laptop-backpack)**\n\nPros: \n\n* Expandable (15L to 25L to 35L)\n\n* Bonus of being secure - great for travel!\n\n* Waterproof\n\nCons:\n\n* TPU base makes me nervous about the durability. I dislike TPU as it tends to peel in my experience\n\n* Zips all being up against the back is good for security, but without being able to try out the bag for few weeks myself, I can't tell if this is a nice bonus or an annoyance\n\n* No way of wearing this in messenger or briefcase mode\n\n[**Aer Travel Pack 2**](https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/aer/travel-pack-2-2/)\n\nPros:\n\n* Straightforward backpack\n\n* Waterproof\n\n* Compressible, but it's still going to be quite wide for EDC\n\nCons:\n\n* No stowable shoulder straps\n\n[**Black Ember Forge Max**](https://blackember.com/products/forge-max)\n\nPros:\n\n* Expandable (20L to 30L)\n\n* Convertible to a briefcase\n\nCons:\n\n* [Doesn't look the hottest when expanded](https://alexkwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC03305-800x1200.png)\n\n* The same problem I had with my Incase: the pockets are sideways\n\n* Not a fan of the looks\n\nThanks in advance!",

It also compresses down very well.  If I have a light load, I can cinch down the Forge to a really slim briefcase.  I also think it works well as a backpack and shoulder bag.  It is one of the only bags I have that allows me to switch between the modes easily.  In fact, sometimes I switch from shoulder/briefcase to backpack while waiting for the elevator at my office.  \n\nIt holds a lot expanded too.  It doesn’t look great fully expanded or sort of half packed, but it cleans up when you use the compression straps.  I also recommend, if you can, not fully expanding it.  I usually leave the bottom expansion zipped, and it looks a lot cleaner.  Sometimes you need to pack it out, and it can hold a lot.  I think it looks good enough.  If it is packed out, it is more function than form for me.  It does look better packed out as a shoulder bag than backpack though.  It can get pretty thick when expanded all the way.",

I haven't bitten the bullet yet, but right now, it's come down to the Forge Max and the Setout Divide. \n\nFor a TL;DR, as I am primarily a backpack user, I am leaning more towards the Setout Divide because it is a backpack first, while the Forge is a briefcase first. \n\nMy current Incase is the same configuration as the Forge and it drives me crazy every time I use it. It feels like the bag is fighting me because nothing stays in the pockets. This is a compromise I know I have to make, but at least I can make the compromise more palatable with the Setout Divide.\n\nI've listed down my comparison of the two if you (or anyone finding this through Google) are interested!\n\n___\n\nForge Max is better because...\n\n* Despite what I said about its looks, I've grown to like how it looks. It looks fantastic as a briefcase (although the zippers look weird when in backpack mode) and I would be proud to tote it around whereas the Setout Divide looks... eh. It kinda passes. It's a fine backpack, but as a briefcase it looks mildly lame.\n\n* It's more water-resistant - the Setout Divide has minimal water-proofing, if any.\n\n* Its quick access pocket actually has dimension. The quick access pocket (and the admin compartment as well!) on the Setout Divide has no dimension, but I will give it that I can imagine it would look slightly less sleek if it had more material on the front.\n\n* Very superficial and I'm sure it will only be novel for a while, but it has magnetic sternum strap and key ring holder.\n\n* Seems to be able to pack a lot in while remaining decent-looking.\n\nSetout Divide is better because...\n\n* The Setout Divide is a backpack first and a briefcase second, while the Forge Max feels like a briefcase first, backpack second because of the quick access pocket which is what I would interact with everyday. The Setout Divide aligns more with my use case. I am going to primarily be in backpack mode, with a physical client meeting once every few months. Both can be messenger bags (although the Setout Divide does not come with a shoulder strap).\n\n* Setout Divide has a water bottle holder while the Forge Max requires a separate attachment, and even then it's located on the top if you have it in backpack mode.\n\n* Quite a few of the zippers are lockable, while the Forge only has zipper garages to make the zippers more difficult to open up.\n\n* (With the knowledge that liter specifications are not really regulated) It is able to hold a bit more stuff compared to the Forge's 30L.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/18rodep/black_ember_citadel_r3_25_liter/",
        "selftext": "I purchased the 25 liter version of this bag in the ‘Max’ package which provides the additional handle and a set of compression straps for the bottom of the bag. I’ve also purchased a set of the black straps and am still on the fence for which I’ll use (I’m leaning towards using the Ember Orange color, but let me know what you think).\n\nOutside of the bag:\nThe color is called Slate Blue and it exhibits shades of blue, grey, slate and also shows bits of purple. It’s a subtle color and visually appealing.\n\nThe fabric is quite unique to me. Cordura’s 420D Velocity fabric is made up of recycled materials but still has this real fabric feel. It has a very tight weave, is very smooth and feels very robust, while at the same time feeling very pliable.  \n\nThe handles are very plush and soft, and it leads me to believe that these will be nice to use.  I’ve got the second handle on the left side of the bag, the same side EVERGOODS has their carry handle installed on (non-mirror).\n\nThe zipper pulls are slick and tougher to grab hold of. Even though they offer the enhanced security feature of securing them through the hypalon pull tab at the end of the zipper track, I’m not sure that outweighs the overall experience. It’s a similar experience to that of the leather pulls that came on the Griffin collab — almost too slick. These are better than the Griffin pulls, as there is a texture to the pull allowing for a bit of grip.  I’ll leave these on for now, but may be looking to change these before too long. \n\nThe straps felt a little thin as I took it out of the bag, but this concern was put to rest once I had the bag on my back with a full loadout inside. This pack is very comfortable to wear. I tend to keep bags pretty high and tight most the time. The back panel is a fairly dense foam but has a nice thin, soft mesh covering both sides. The foam also has perforations  and airflow holes, which help with breathability. The luggage passthrough is tightly sewn on and doesn’t have any sag. This will feel very secure when paired with rolling luggage. The Fidlock sternum strap is my least favorite style. You have to push in on the front, towards your chest to release it the magnet. As I’ve used the bag, it has grown on me but they are replaceable so I’ll continue to see how it is in use for a while before making any changes. Bonus points for being removable. \n\nThe straps are secured by integrated keepers on the webbing. This is awesome, and I wish this was a standard for all bags. Black Ember has the keeper looped around the wedding on the strap and I’ve found that when the pack is on my bag and tightened that the keepers bottom-out on the webbing.  This causes a bit of slack to appear. I’m 6’0, so your mileage will vary as torso heights are taller or shorter. To fix this, I rolled the strap and keeper upwards to remove the extra slack to my desired preference. I attached an image of the before and after.\n\nIt does not stand on its own without being packed out.  Even then, it wants to fall forward a bit. That’s never been an issue with bags for me, but it is nice when a bag does stand on its own and I know some folks here expect this as part of the price of admission with their bags. \n\nLastly, the compression straps. Not sure how I feel about these. When they are not securing anything to the bag, they do not remain tight, and begin to droop.  You can even see the slack in some of the images.  That’s definitely something that will bother me, as I’d want them to stay tight around the bottom of the bag.  I can see use cases where I’d have something down there but I’m thinking these might be better off unattached and at-the-ready somewhere inside the bag. \n\nInside of the bag:\nThe lower front pocket is deceptively large. It will easily swallow a smaller jacket or layer. It also fits my moleskin notebook and 5th generation iPad (9.7”) to give you an idea of depth below the zipper line.   I’m only keeping a few small pouches in there right now. \n\nI’m using the top front pocket as my QAP. It’s separated into two slots and also has the Black Ember magnetic key leash tethered to the top of that pocket.  In there I keep my work badge, snacks, my ArcCo Boulder organizer (with my torch and blade), Heroclip, chapstick and pen. \n\nInside the primary compartment of the bag, there is a sleeve against the back panel. The front panel has quite a bit of organization, including a slot for a tablet with a magnetic closure, a zippered slot that also fits my XL sized moleskin notebook, another slot that is always exposed where I am keeping my moleskin notebook and then there is another zippered pocket closer to the front of the bag that extends down the entire front panel.  It’s pretty incredible how much storage and also organization this bag offers. Some may find the options overwhelming but it’s great for me as I can easily throw smaller pouches into these more dedicated spots.\n\nThere is not much to say about the dedicated laptop compartment. The bag lacks any fleece lining or anything soft, but it is very padded and suspended — ensuring that your machine will be transported securely. \n\nAs a fan of Black Ember, and have owned their products previously, I am happy to say that this bag is an upgrade in both my experience using the bag as well as with the materials they’ve chosen. This is a great bag for EDC, and for folks that don’t require a dedicated laptop sleeve and have a slightly smaller carry, the 18 liter variant would be a good option. The only thing to reiterate would be that this bag does not stand well on its own, and will not unless packed. It’s also a bag that offer ample organization so if this isn’t your style, you may want to consider a bag with a more cavernous primary compartment. \n\nPictures: https://imgur.com/a/jMVREdd",

My 16\" one doesn't jostle around, but what the big size means is that i can also throw a slim pouch or two in that compartment on top of the laptop. For example, my Boundary Supply Rennen Pouch fits in there just fine even with the laptop in it as well. It's almost like a second quick-access pocket--too much good space to be wasted.",

I tend not to bring mine when traveling, so I have to think a bit creatively on how to use that section.\n\nMHP &gt; day sling for me right now. The organization of the back section fits my wallet, battery pack, sanitizer, and other edc perfectly and then I’m able to throw my mask and anything else in the larger compartment and just have some extra room if I need it. Day sling is a bit smaller than the MHP, and a different kind of look. More technical looking imo.

It worked great for storage, but like many bags I've found that I can pack it with a lot more weight than I can comfortably carry, *especially* when it's expanded. The waist strap solves this issue nicely and I can put the straps (Aer Hip Belt, that I had floating around already) in the hidden pocket behind the cushioning.",
