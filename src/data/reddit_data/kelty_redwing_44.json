            "body": "The PD fully packed out with the same gear is about 2 lbs heavier, but I’ll be honest picking it up and putting it on my back the PD feels much more weighty - like I have to heave it over my shoulder. I haven’t had any issues with traveling with the PD. I’ve never felt the need or desire to take it off cuz the straps were hurting. For reference I’m am 6’1”, 24” torso, 210lbs and I’m a pretty strong guy that lifts weights a lot.\n\nThat being said, the KotaUL straps were very comfortable. The load lifters are really really nice and I wish the PD had them. I would trade the fancy stow-ability of the PD for a good set of load lifters tbh. The KotaUL felt really nice on my back. It felt much more lower profile and I felt more nimble than the PD. When turning, I can feel the PD float like a Cadillac, but the Kota felt more attached to me. Also, I had a lot more room available on the KotaUL. A lot of the internal pockets were unused and I tried not to fill the external pockets too much but could have fit much more. I like the amount of internal pockets in the KotaUL but I felt that the PD had overall more space inside the main compartment (a full medium PD packing cube, full small PD cube and Aer Travel Kit 2 and it was pretty maxed out) that’s not even considering that the expansion zip on the PD. I do have a few nitpicks on the Kota though: the webbing feels very cheap, the zippers don’t feel as chunky as I think they should (but what do I know?) and there should be strap keepers imo. \n\nI didn’t have much time to give the KotaUL a full test ride, because I was literally packing for a trip that I’m about to get on and I decided to go with the PD. Ultimately, I felt like I was fine with the PD and couldn’t justify the price tag on the KotaUL for what (at least from a design and feel standpoint) I see as a subpar product for the price point and since I’ve had the PD for 5+ years already without any wear issues. The KotaUL definitely a good product and a good (and much lighter) alternative on the market and worth a try if you’re thinking about it and are really worried about how the PD carries and it’s weight.",

I LOVE this little guy. I can fit my 1L water bottle or my mirrorless camera in here, which makes it a great roadtripping/adventure buddy.\n\nBlue/orange Patagonia Arbor pack (XL? Probably 32L.) Bought it secondhand and haven't been able to find much info about this one. I really wanted to like this pack, but the shoulder straps feel like my cheapo school backpacks in the 90s.\n\nGray Osprey Talon (22L). The comfiest backpack I've ever had. If I'm doing a serious dayhike, this is the bag I'm taking. It's one of those that you forget you're wearing.\n\n**Second Row Up:**\n\nGreen REI Big Haul duffel (90L). Super heavy duty duffel with a neat look. I mainly use it to pack up my clothes when I move.\n\nGray Patagonia Black Hole Cube (6L). My main toiletry bag, which I pretty much live out of.\n\nSmall black Ikea pouch (fits inside main toiletry bag)\n\nBlue Harry's toiletry bag from Target (used as makeup bag)\n\nREI Roadtripper Pouch\n\nOrange REI Flash Pack 18: super lightweight and folds down small/flat for packing. Still pretty comfy as long as it's not overloaded.\n\nPacking Cubes: medium Eagle Creek with clean/dirty sides + a cheapo Ikea cube.\n\nBlue Osprey Ultralight Waistpack\n\nFruit-print Lily Bloom weekender bag. Bought this one secondhand and don't know anything about the brand.\n\n**Third Row Up:**\n\nGreenish Patagonia Black Hole duffel (40L): This one is supposed to fold into its own pocket, but I could not get it to work. Otherwise excellent and VERY sturdy bag.\n\nBlack Kelty Redwing Tactical pack (30L): Really comfy, spacious, and veryyy sturdy.\n\nGray/Gold Osprey Daylite Tote-Pack (20L): has backpack straps that hide away. This is my absolute favorite bag right now. I really love its versatility!\n\nBasic bowling ball bag from Bowling.com\n\n**Top Row:**\n\nBasic Adidas gym bag. I didn't need this. I had a brief gym phase, ugh\n\nOrange REI Ruckpack (28L). I envision using this as a very minimalist travel bag in the future. I haven't had much of a chance to use it yet, but I love the look and it's very comfy to wear. Also comes with a built-in raincover, which is awesome.\n\nGreen Kelty Redwing (44L). This is my wilderness backpack. I switched from a 50L Osprey and like this one WAY more. It's light, very comfy to wear when loaded up, unzips super wide, and has great organization.\n\nDisneyland Starbucks tote: where I store my hats and stuff\n\nREI Roadtripper duffel: using this as storage for work uniforms. Folds down into its pocket and has a shoulder strap, but overall just your basic duffel.\n\nDarcy Marks leather purse: Was gifted this one and am not familiar with the brand.\n\n**Questions welcome!**",

I LOVE this little guy. I can fit my 1L water bottle or my mirrorless camera in here, which makes it a great roadtripping/adventure buddy.\n\nBlue/orange Patagonia Arbor pack (XL? Probably 32L.) Bought it secondhand and haven't been able to find much info about this one. I really wanted to like this pack, but the shoulder straps feel like my cheapo school backpacks in the 90s.\n\nGray Osprey Talon (22L). The comfiest backpack I've ever had. If I'm doing a serious dayhike, this is the bag I'm taking. It's one of those that you forget you're wearing.\n\n**Second Row Up:**\n\nGreen REI Big Haul duffel (90L). Super heavy duty duffel with a neat look. I mainly use it to pack up my clothes when I move.\n\nGray Patagonia Black Hole Cube (6L). My main toiletry bag, which I pretty much live out of.\n\nSmall black Ikea pouch (fits inside main toiletry bag)\n\nBlue Harry's toiletry bag from Target (used as makeup bag)\n\nREI Roadtripper Pouch\n\nOrange REI Flash Pack 18: super lightweight and folds down small/flat for packing. Still pretty comfy as long as it's not overloaded.\n\nPacking Cubes: medium Eagle Creek with clean/dirty sides + a cheapo Ikea cube.\n\nBlue Osprey Ultralight Waistpack\n\nFruit-print Lily Bloom weekender bag. Bought this one secondhand and don't know anything about the brand.\n\n**Third Row Up:**\n\nGreenish Patagonia Black Hole duffel (40L): This one is supposed to fold into its own pocket, but I could not get it to work. Otherwise excellent and VERY sturdy bag.\n\nBlack Kelty Redwing Tactical pack (30L): Really comfy, spacious, and veryyy sturdy.\n\nGray/Gold Osprey Daylite Tote-Pack (20L): has backpack straps that hide away. This is my absolute favorite bag right now. I really love its versatility!\n\nBasic bowling ball bag from Bowling.com\n\n**Top Row:**\n\nBasic Adidas gym bag. I didn't need this. I had a brief gym phase, ugh\n\nOrange REI Ruckpack (28L). I envision using this as a very minimalist travel bag in the future. I haven't had much of a chance to use it yet, but I love the look and it's very comfy to wear. Also comes with a built-in raincover, which is awesome.\n\nGreen Kelty Redwing (44L). This is my wilderness backpack. I switched from a 50L Osprey and like this one WAY more. It's light, very comfy to wear when loaded up, unzips super wide, and has great organization.\n\nDisneyland Starbucks tote: where I store my hats and stuff\n\nREI Roadtripper duffel: using this as storage for work uniforms. Folds down into its pocket and has a shoulder strap, but overall just your basic duffel.\n\nDarcy Marks leather purse: Was gifted this one and am not familiar with the brand.\n\n**Questions welcome!**",

Only played with it a bit ..... \n\nI'm a dorky Canuck so our liquids have always been coleman fuel, or white gas, or Napatha depending on what you wanna call it.  Maybe its because of the colder weather?  (again a guess)  do Trangia's work OK in really cold weather? \n\nIn the past 30 years, (yea I'm getting up there ) there's been a big rise in with IsoButane and it's now OK for really cold weather and does have a ton more flame control for simmering compared to some white gas stoves.  A lot of them  you can set for many varied choices in heat output - those being off or melt steel mode!  :-)      \n\nIt's a big PIA, but my pocket rocket is a dream to simmer on.  The one bummer is the cartridges but you can get pocket size or big buggers that last for weeks.\n\nI'm guessing you gotta be pretty careful about tipping a meths stove too huh?   Just wondering ......  Do you folks like em?",

                "body": "I do like my trangia quite a bit, and I'm actually American! I burn denatured alcohol in it. You can burn about any alcohol truly but there are few that end up with a good flame or without soot. Never tried methylated spirits with it. I also have the trangia multifuel, which fits into the cooker and takes  almost every type of liquid fuel you could want, which will burn at cold temperatures far better than spirits. I prefer white gas for that. I believe they also sell a butane adapter for the trangia if you wanted to use it too. About the flame control part, the trangia comes with this 'simmer ring' for the spirit burner, which lets you constrict the flame to lower the heat. Above all, i like the trangia because its also an all in one and collapsible pot, pan, and plate set. They even have all the pots and pans in different materials, from my choice of a stainless steel aluminum laminate they call duossal, to pure aluminum, to hard anodized aluminum, nonstick teflon, and titanium. And yeah, you wouldnt want to tip it over, but the whole kit comes with a wind guard and a wide base to sit the burner in to prevent that. Thanks for asking",

Only played with it a bit ..... \n\nI'm a dorky Canuck so our liquids have always been coleman fuel, or white gas, or Napatha depending on what you wanna call it.  Maybe its because of the colder weather?  (again a guess)  do Trangia's work OK in really cold weather? \n\nIn the past 30 years, (yea I'm getting up there ) there's been a big rise in with IsoButane and it's now OK for really cold weather and does have a ton more flame control for simmering compared to some white gas stoves.  A lot of them  you can set for many varied choices in heat output - those being off or melt steel mode!  :-)      \n\nIt's a big PIA, but my pocket rocket is a dream to simmer on.  The one bummer is the cartridges but you can get pocket size or big buggers that last for weeks.\n\nI'm guessing you gotta be pretty careful about tipping a meths stove too huh?   Just wondering ......  Do you folks like em?",

                "body": "I do like my trangia quite a bit, and I'm actually American! I burn denatured alcohol in it. You can burn about any alcohol truly but there are few that end up with a good flame or without soot. Never tried methylated spirits with it. I also have the trangia multifuel, which fits into the cooker and takes  almost every type of liquid fuel you could want, which will burn at cold temperatures far better than spirits. I prefer white gas for that. I believe they also sell a butane adapter for the trangia if you wanted to use it too. About the flame control part, the trangia comes with this 'simmer ring' for the spirit burner, which lets you constrict the flame to lower the heat. Above all, i like the trangia because its also an all in one and collapsible pot, pan, and plate set. They even have all the pots and pans in different materials, from my choice of a stainless steel aluminum laminate they call duossal, to pure aluminum, to hard anodized aluminum, nonstick teflon, and titanium. And yeah, you wouldnt want to tip it over, but the whole kit comes with a wind guard and a wide base to sit the burner in to prevent that. Thanks for asking",

I would consider another one, but a lot of the reviews I’ve read say that the new one isn’t anywhere near as good as the old ones. \n\nMust haves are similar size or slightly smaller. This one just barely fits under the seat on a plane. Multiple exterior pockets, I especially like and use the multi compartment front pocket and the top pocket. I have lots of small things I need to be able to grab on a daily basis when working. Outside pockets that can hold water bottles. \n\nWould like to haves. The pass through side pockets or similar for holding longer items like my fly rod here. Some kind of outer stuff pocket that a light jacket can be stuffed into. \n\nThanks for any suggestions you may have. ",

Also, the pole in the back system is flat whereas in previous models it had a bevel on the sides.\n\nBuild quality is also higher on the older redwing 44s like what you have.\n\nThat being said, I'm extremely pleased with my newer tactical 44 - I know it's not quite as awesome as the older models, but it's pretty damn good overall, very comfortable, and quite affordable.\n\nEdit : here's the link for it via kelty. Cheaper on Amazon probably.\n\nhttps://www.kelty.com/redwing-44-tactical/",

I’ve used the 50L Redwing (both a very old version and the 2019 version) for carry-on travel all over the US, Latin America, SE Asia and even Aus/NZ since 2010 and never had problems. I think it’s a great travel bag (panel loading, external pockets, organization), but definitely doesn’t have any urban aesthetic so you’ll look like a traveler.\nThat being said, if you’re doing this many modifications to it, maybe it’s best to find a bag purposely built how you want. I wouldn’t do much beyond shortening or restraining straps and possibly removing the hip belt.",

The length is a real deal killer as it won’t allow the bin to close. Read the carry on maximum dimensions for any airline you will be using. A typical US carrier sets the limit at 22'' x 14'' x 9''. Bargain carriers may be smaller. Maximum weights vary as well. \n\nAirlines want nice little boxes to sit in a row in the bin. Most hiking packs are too tall and too deep front to back. Sub 30 liter packs are a safer bet.",

How much does all your stuff weight, minus consumables like food, fuel, worn items, etc. Lots of people put their gear in [lighterpack.com](https://lighterpack.com) and link it, but you just need to know how much your stuff weights.\n\n2) Your torso length. Measure from c7 vertebrae to your illiac crest on your hips. Or have REI help you pack fit and find it out from them. \n\n3) Waist: You want the hip belt to be comfortable. \n\n4)  Use case: How many miles per day are you going? \n\n5) What isn't working about your current setup? \n\n6) Budget: How much are you willing to fork over for a pack?\n\n7) Volume: Almost forgot, figure out how much space your stuff will take up in a pack. You already have your existing pack, so check what volume it has and see if your stuff fits inside. Decide if you want more or less. \n\nPersonally, I prefer lightweight gear. The lighter your stuff weighs, the lighter the pack you put it in can be, which means that you can hike longer, faster, with less fatigue and injury. However, if you have a pack full of heavy stuff, you can't just buy a light pack. You need a frame to support the weight transfer from your shoulders to your hips. \n\nAlso: don't take stuff you don't need or aren't luxuries you're willing to haul. (ignore if you're just hiking a few miles per day.)",

                "body": "I received it yesterday. I like it too... it's a tad on the small side compared to my other pack, and the hip belt isn't as padded, but it has more organization features that I like, such as the pass-throughs behind the side pockets which are perfect for trekking poles or a machete or whatever, and the admin pouch with pockets in it, and the outside 'stuff' pocket. And I love that the U-zippers lets you open it up all the way like luggage. \n\nMy other hiking pack is a 65L [Field and Stream](https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/dkscdn/15FNSAFSMNTNSCT65CTP_Dark_Shadow_is/) that is basically a big tube with two side pockets and is a pain to organize small items in. And it's top-loading only (well, it has the sleeping bag access at the bottom) so to get to anything that isn't sitting right on top, you have to basically dump everything out, it's a pain. And the compression straps on the side cover up the side pockets and don't have quick release buckles so you have to loosen the straps to get to the sides instead of quickly unbuckling them. Pain.\n\nI still haven't found the perfect pack. I wish there was a 60 liter version of the Redwing. My favorite pack that I own is a clone of the [5.11 Rush 72](http://static.weloveshopping.com/shop/client/000046/cool_bag/TTS-05.jpg), the SOG Barrage, which has *gobs* of little pockets and places to keep everything nice and organized for quick access while still providing ample inner space, opens up like the Kelty, and has the MOLLE webbing which allows you to strap basically anything to the outside... but it's not a 'real' hiking backpack and not very comfortable for long distances when loaded heavy. There's also no air channel in the back, so one gets sweaty quickly. Plus, being a military-style pack, it's built for ruggedness rather than comfort, and it's made of heavy nylon.\n\nI wish I could magically make a mashup of these three packs. I would like the organization and extensibility of the SOG Barrage, the capacity of the Mountain Scout and comfort of its hip belt, and the relative light-weight-ness and innovative features of the Kelty Redwing. Another thing about my other packs that I wish the Kelty had is a way to attach stuff to the hip belt - the [Barrage had MOLLE webbing on the hip belt,](https://bugoutbagprepper.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SOG-Barrage-Tactical-Internal-Frame-Pack-Backpack-0-6.jpg). The Field and Stream had a single nylon strap running across it. On both, I could clip a flashlight and bear spray to the belt for quick access. There's no way to do that on the Kelty, so I'm going to have to figure out how I'm going to have my bear spray at the ready for my 2 day hike and camp in the Joyce Kilmer national forest this weekend (there's a bear alert out).  \n\nThe Kelty does have MOLLE webbing on the bottom, which I have strapped a pouch to that holds my hammock and straps, freeing up room on the inside. But annoyingly, they use an [odd number \\(7\\)](https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2820/33590532481_5d3faff535_b.jpg) of webbing slots. Every MOLLE pouch I've seen has an even number of straps ([example](http://cdn1.evike.com/images/large/pouch-phan-67046-5.jpg)), which means anything you strap to it isn't going to be centered, it has to be one slot to the left or the right. That's not a problem if you're just using the slots to tie down stuff, but if you're using the MOLLE as it was designed to be used (with MOLLE attachments) it's always going to be uncentered. Not a big deal, just an irritation.\n\nOne of these days, I will find the perfect pack... I might make a thread asking if anyone knows of anything that incorporates all the features I like.",

On the day it was set to arrive, I logged into Amazon to check up on the order, only to see that after I ordered it, Amazon started providing it for $83.99. I called and asked if they could refund me the difference... and they said no, I'd have to refuse the package and re-order. Which is silly, but whatever. So I had to race home to beat the UPS driver and refuse the package. Worth it though, that's a $60 savings.\n\n**NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE REDWING 50 ON AMAZON.** This is the pre-2016 model: https://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Redwing-Backpack-Medium-Large/dp/B009R6B7EG/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1502993250&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=kelty%2Bredwing%2B50&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\n\nNote that the price there begins at $88.47.\n\nI'm thinking someone at Amazon probably screwed up and are listing the 2016 version for the pre-2016 model prices, so this might not last long.

I think bringing 6x short/long sleeve shirts in addition to 4x half-zips/sweaters is probably a bit much if you're looking to cut weight. Maybe try cutting those numbers in half and rewearing what you've got.\n\nI just took a weeklong trip to Finland and Estonia and was almost perfect with:\n\n- Synthetic insulated mid-weight jacket\n\n- Synthetic/wool insulated pullover\n\n- Lightweight wool sweater\n\n- 250-weight merino long-sleeve baselayer\n\n- 150-weight merino short-sleeve baselayer\n\n- Levi's commuter chinos (if I owned good travel pants I totally would've worn them)\n\n- 3x Smartwool socks\n\n- 3x merino boxer briefs\n\n- Merino hat and gloves\n\n- Timberland waterproof boots\n\nAll I wished I had brought in addition was maybe a warmer down jacket, but the weather was a little finicky so I opted for more layers and a water-resistant synthetic fill insulated jacket over a heavier down one. (You've solved this problem already with a waterproof/down triclimate jacket).\n\nI could've stretched the above setup for two weeks for sure, but maybe would have brought one more heavy baselayer or sweater if I was going for longer.\n\nedit: I used to work for Smartwool and I noticed you packed all \"ultralight\" weight socks. Totally recommend getting yourself some medium- or heavy-cushioned PhD or Hike socks for a trip like this!",
