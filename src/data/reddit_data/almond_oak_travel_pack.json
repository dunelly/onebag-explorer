Another good thing is that now the backpack has a quick access pocket on the inside the very top pocket is now easy to access with only opening the main compartment on top.\n\nI payed 50€ for that and im very happy with the result.\nWe will see if It's durable enough :) \nheading now to Thailand for 6 months SEA backpacking\n\nEdit: with YYK zippers but i dont like metal zipper pulls so i cut them off and replaced with some 2mm paracord.\nI like the blue on black looking and for visibility It's abeswome",

I traveled by train with my family for a ski trip and I packed everything I needed for a week into it plus some shared stuff like my daughter slippers and pyjama for the night train change. I also used it daily for hiking and snowboarding. The front pocket is handy to store your beanie or gloves or just a pack of wet/dry tissues. It didn’t get wet during the heavy rain and snow day, zippers were fine even when I felt down doing 360. It feels great, it is just a pleasure to have it aside and it’s a pleasure to touch it. \nThe only downside that I do not like so far is getting it on my back. Straps are quite stiff and it takes more effort to fit the second hand and then to unwrap them sometimes.  And I still to discover the way to use sternum strap - now I didn’t find it comfortable or helping to relief the weight. \n\nOther than that this bag is close to perfect.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jcopta/thule_landmark_40_review_after_3_weeks_in_mexico/",
        "selftext": "\nI love bags and don’t think you can have one that fits all your needs. So I was missing a bag to go one-bag traveling, as I really like the idea of not bringing a big hard suitcase and too much stuff. I have other bags for other needs, so my collection now fits most of my needs (things can always be improved, but I don’t like to spend money if I already have a bag that can fulfill +80% of the need).\n\nI chose the Landmark 40 as I wanted a carry-on size backpack for longer travels, and one I could use at home for weekend trips. I like gear and love to bring home souvenirs when traveling. I would rather have some empty space than fully pack my bag. I have seen a lot of nice reviews and comments about the ula Dragonfly, but the bag is too small for this kind of trip for me. Also, I don’t like the look of the ULA Camino, and since I live in Denmark, it is expensive to buy.\n\nI have been looking at more than 50 bags and narrowed down the list of possibilities by being harder on my criteria. Here were some of my criteria:\n- Clamshell or wide opening to the main compartment, so it is easy to access your stuff.\n- Hip belt and some degree of hiding hip belt and shoulder straps without looking ugly.\n- Good harness system without it taking too much space when stored in an airplane.\n- Not too heavy.\n- Not a roll-up bag.\n- Possible to use the bag on many occasions, not just backpacking.\n- Not too expensive to get.\n\nI was then choosing between the Osprey Porter, Sojourn 30, Fairview 40, Peak Design 45 (35-45L), and the Thule Landmark 40.\n\n- The Porter was not chosen as I thought 30 liters was going to be too small for longer travels for me\n- Fairview was not chosen as its ability to hide straps is not well, and the design is too “backpacking” and mainstream for me to use when I take smaller trips in Europe and Denmark.\n- Peak Design 45 is over-designed and makes it heavy and bulky for me, even though I like the features. It is also quite expensive.\n\nTherefore, I ended up with the Landmark as I could use it as a backpack and a “duffel bag”. Here is my review after 3 weeks in Mexico.\n\nFirst of all, the 40-liter size seems correct to me and I can recognize one of the things from a YouTube review I saw: it feels like you can always stuff more into the bag, as the bag is soft. I really like this, as I like to bring souvenirs home. The materials of the bag feel fine so far, so no complaints here.\n\nThe shoulder straps and harness system work fine. It is not like one of the backpacking harness systems you get in the big Osprey bags, but it is fine for wearing under an hour. The hip belt fits my body well (I am 180 cm and weigh 82 kg). Shoulder straps and hip belt can be hidden, but it takes some effort. If the hip belt is hidden, you can feel it up against your body, so I only put it away when flying.\n\nThere are not a lot of organization possibilities in this bag, but some:\n- Laptop compartment: I travel without a laptop, so I don’t have any major comments on this, but it is there and looks to be working fine.\n- Water bottle pocket: takes some space from the main compartment, but it is there and works well for me.\n- Top hard pocket: a little weird for the bag as you cannot lock it with the zippers, but it still worked out well to store my GoPro and other valuables. I managed to lock it with the main compartment zippers, but if a thief really wants to steal from you, I don’t believe you can find any bag that can protect you from that.\n- Main compartment:\n  - It has a hidden pocket which is good to hide flat items, works well, and is hard to find.\n  - It has a net/mesh compartment in the opening which works well for small soft items.\n  - The main compartment is just one big space, really good for packing cubes and fits all your stuff. There are two compression straps to hold your items. They work fine, but they feel a bit cheap and vulnerable.\n\nWhen you are packed, you zip the main compartment and then clip the compression straps on. For some people, I can imagine them being annoying, but they did not bother me.\n\nWhat I don’t like about this bag/what could be improved:\n- A bit easier to hide the hip belt without it being bulky against your body.\n- Another small side pocket inside the main compartment would be nice.\n- Ability to lock the top hard pocket.\n- Water bottle pocket to take less space from the main compartment.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this bag. I really like it. \n\n",

        "selftext": "\nI love bags and don’t think you can have one that fits all your needs. So I was missing a bag to go one-bag traveling, as I really like the idea of not bringing a big hard suitcase and too much stuff. I have other bags for other needs, so my collection now fits most of my needs (things can always be improved, but I don’t like to spend money if I already have a bag that can fulfill +80% of the need).\n\nI chose the Landmark 40 as I wanted a carry-on size backpack for longer travels, and one I could use at home for weekend trips. I like gear and love to bring home souvenirs when traveling. I would rather have some empty space than fully pack my bag. I have seen a lot of nice reviews and comments about the ula Dragonfly, but the bag is too small for this kind of trip for me. Also, I don’t like the look of the ULA Camino, and since I live in Denmark, it is expensive to buy.\n\nI have been looking at more than 50 bags and narrowed down the list of possibilities by being harder on my criteria. Here were some of my criteria:\n- Clamshell or wide opening to the main compartment, so it is easy to access your stuff.\n- Hip belt and some degree of hiding hip belt and shoulder straps without looking ugly.\n- Good harness system without it taking too much space when stored in an airplane.\n- Not too heavy.\n- Not a roll-up bag.\n- Possible to use the bag on many occasions, not just backpacking.\n- Not too expensive to get.\n\nI was then choosing between the Osprey Porter, Sojourn 30, Fairview 40, Peak Design 45 (35-45L), and the Thule Landmark 40.\n\n- The Porter was not chosen as I thought 30 liters was going to be too small for longer travels for me\n- Fairview was not chosen as its ability to hide straps is not well, and the design is too “backpacking” and mainstream for me to use when I take smaller trips in Europe and Denmark.\n- Peak Design 45 is over-designed and makes it heavy and bulky for me, even though I like the features. It is also quite expensive.\n\nTherefore, I ended up with the Landmark as I could use it as a backpack and a “duffel bag”. Here is my review after 3 weeks in Mexico.\n\nFirst of all, the 40-liter size seems correct to me and I can recognize one of the things from a YouTube review I saw: it feels like you can always stuff more into the bag, as the bag is soft. I really like this, as I like to bring souvenirs home. The materials of the bag feel fine so far, so no complaints here.\n\nThe shoulder straps and harness system work fine. It is not like one of the backpacking harness systems you get in the big Osprey bags, but it is fine for wearing under an hour. The hip belt fits my body well (I am 180 cm and weigh 82 kg). Shoulder straps and hip belt can be hidden, but it takes some effort. If the hip belt is hidden, you can feel it up against your body, so I only put it away when flying.\n\nThere are not a lot of organization possibilities in this bag, but some:\n- Laptop compartment: I travel without a laptop, so I don’t have any major comments on this, but it is there and looks to be working fine.\n- Water bottle pocket: takes some space from the main compartment, but it is there and works well for me.\n- Top hard pocket: a little weird for the bag as you cannot lock it with the zippers, but it still worked out well to store my GoPro and other valuables. I managed to lock it with the main compartment zippers, but if a thief really wants to steal from you, I don’t believe you can find any bag that can protect you from that.\n- Main compartment:\n  - It has a hidden pocket which is good to hide flat items, works well, and is hard to find.\n  - It has a net/mesh compartment in the opening which works well for small soft items.\n  - The main compartment is just one big space, really good for packing cubes and fits all your stuff. There are two compression straps to hold your items. They work fine, but they feel a bit cheap and vulnerable.\n\nWhen you are packed, you zip the main compartment and then clip the compression straps on. For some people, I can imagine them being annoying, but they did not bother me.\n\nWhat I don’t like about this bag/what could be improved:\n- A bit easier to hide the hip belt without it being bulky against your body.\n- Another small side pocket inside the main compartment would be nice.\n- Ability to lock the top hard pocket.\n- Water bottle pocket to take less space from the main compartment.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this bag. I really like it. \n\n",

I do wish there was an actual black version, and I broke the buckle on the sternum strap two and half years into owning it. Ended up sewing on a new one with the straps that came with it.\nOberall I do like it, but I wish it had load lifters for heavier loads. Otherwise quite good. The hard top is great. So is the hidden security pocket. Theese days it is too big for my liking, but I do use it whenever I need to bring a lot of stuff, and also sometimea for hiking trips. ",

Plus, I love Osprey’s warranty. My one qualm is that there is only one dinky looking strap to hold down everything in the largest compartment. \n\nI love that the Cotopaxi has mesh dividers, but it very slightly exceeds personal item size (19 inch vs 18inch) and it doesn’t have that cool expansion zipper. Also - it’s $100 more. Idk if mesh dividers are worth $100 especially if the warranty isn’t as good as Osprey’s. \n\nWould love some advice from folks with experience with these or similar bags.

This thread often gets bogged down in which  $XXX bag is the most perfect of all the perfect ones, but the lifestyle, I think, should be more important than the hardware. First figure out what you need to take, and then find a bag to fit. Some other thoughts:\n\n\\- I recently discovered that there is a healthy market for used bags, both in this thread and on eBay. These things generally don't wear out, so don't be afraid to try that. Consider the Buy Nothing concept :)\n\n\\- backpacks put all the weight of your stuff on your back, and they aren't convenient to get stuff in/out once it's on you - wheels were invented for a reason, so if you're going some place that's mostly paved flat surfaces, like airports, parking lots, and hotels, a bag with wheels might be a lot easier to live with. Hiking across South America, or making a 2 day trip - different story. \n\n\\- I've been on a lot of airplanes where the space under the seat in front of me where \"personal items\" go was a LOT less than the official dimensions the same airline says is the limit for then. A lot of  airlines list PI dimensions only an inch or two less than the 22x14x9\" carry on dimensions - I have no idea how that's supposed to work, so I'd be careful buying at the PI limit as you might not be gaining any advantage.\n\nBest wishes for happy trails for you!",

        "selftext": "I want a pack I can use as a personal item but could also fit a few days of clothes in. I’ve narrowed my opens down to two: the Osprey Daylite™ Expandable Travel Pack 26+6 and the Cotopaxi Allpa 28L Travel Pack. \n\nI love that the Osprey can expand if I want to use it as a carry on vs a personal item. Plus, I love Osprey’s warranty. My one qualm is that there is only one dinky looking strap to hold down everything in the largest compartment. \n\nI love that the Cotopaxi has mesh dividers, but it very slightly exceeds personal item size (19 inch vs 18inch) and it doesn’t have that cool expansion zipper. Also - it’s $100 more. Idk if mesh dividers are worth $100 especially if the warranty isn’t as good as Osprey’s. \n\nWould love some advice from folks with experience with these or similar bags. Or is there another bag I should be considering? ",

This thread often gets bogged down in which  $XXX bag is the most perfect of all the perfect ones, but the lifestyle, I think, should be more important than the hardware. First figure out what you need to take, and then find a bag to fit. Some other thoughts:\n\n\\- I recently discovered that there is a healthy market for used bags, both in this thread and on eBay. These things generally don't wear out, so don't be afraid to try that. Consider the Buy Nothing concept :)\n\n\\- backpacks put all the weight of your stuff on your back, and they aren't convenient to get stuff in/out once it's on you - wheels were invented for a reason, so if you're going some place that's mostly paved flat surfaces, like airports, parking lots, and hotels, a bag with wheels might be a lot easier to live with. Hiking across South America, or making a 2 day trip - different story. \n\n\\- I've been on a lot of airplanes where the space under the seat in front of me where \"personal items\" go was a LOT less than the official dimensions the same airline says is the limit for then. A lot of  airlines list PI dimensions only an inch or two less than the 22x14x9\" carry on dimensions - I have no idea how that's supposed to work, so I'd be careful buying at the PI limit as you might not be gaining any advantage.\n\nBest wishes for happy trails for you!",

It was €100, but I signed up to their newsletter for a 10% discount.

I need to choose it without being there as I’m meeting my friend at a conference and she will bring one for me to bring home. I’ve tried the REI Trail 25 on in-store and found it incredibly comfortable. I’m worried it’s a bit delicate and not waterproof enough for living in the rainy Northwest of Lancaster/Cumbria. The Gregory Resin looks a little “smarter” for going to conferences and is more likely to help me out in rain. Because I’ve one-bagged with as much as 20 lbs that needs to be taken into account as well (also need to just carry less). \n\nCrucial to me is the sternum strap, some back/shoulder paddding on straps etc, a water bottle pocket, and a large main compartment to take packing cubes/bags. My usual bag is a black Osprey Porter 30 but it’s too “cinched down” for every day use and no water bottle pocket. It also looks too big on some of the airlines I’ve brought it as my personal bag.",

That’s the point where I would shift to a pack that has a true load transferring harness and comes in a torso size that fits properly.

Never check the water-resistance, mainly because I never use it for anything that’s critical for staying dry. I’d say just use a plastic liner if you’re worried about it. \n\nEither way, great bag. Wouldn’t say it’s worth the full asking price, I’d wait until REI runs one of its many sales to grab one. \n\nFor that matter I think the Resin may still be on sale in the outlet section of the REI website",

I tried the 26 as well and it was a bit too big (stuck out from my back too far). I like using the Resin 24 since I can pull out my packing cubes and use it as a daypack when I reach my destination. Main compartment is huge and just a giant bucket so you can fit a lot in there! The exterior is very durable and water resistant (haven't tried it in a downpour, but it's fine for drizzles I'd imagine). Fits under the seat of any airline I've tried.\n\nIt's very comfortable for regular usage and walking around (10 mile days, including many miles fully packed on the way to/from the airport). Wasn't as comfortable to use when biking, but I didn't get it for that purpose. The back panel has ventilation so my back stayed dry. It fits under the seat on airlines and the way it zips up with the gussets helps compress your stuff even more. I've taken it to Alaska, Michigan, and Minneapolis so far. Haven't tried the Trail 25, but the Resin 24 checked all of my marks!\n\nOne note is that I don't usually bring a laptop, so I wanted a bag with minimal laptop space but that still had a compartment just in case. With a laptop it would get a bit more snug inside but the laptop would be right next to your back which is nice for weight distribution. Good luck!",

The Vale is my everyday purse, but I love it for travel because it's quite small and low-profile when it's mostly empty, but can nonetheless hold a lot if it doesn't fold over. (One complaint with the Vale: the vinyl leather detail is wearing off and looks kind of ratty, so I need to replace or repair it.)\n\nPacking for this trip made it clear to me, though, that the Vale is not ideal as a purse for personal-item-only travel, because it takes up slightly more space in my bag than I'd like. For a future trip I'd like to get a really small sling bag, that I can wear close enough to my body that I can probably get away with wearing it onto a plane under my sweater/coat. \n\nThat got me thinking, though: a lot of my travel is for work, and I have to carry my laptop with me at my destination. My laptop (just barely) fits in the Sherpani Vale, so that I don't have to carry my bigger luggage bag with me. But surely there are better ways to deal with this problem, if I think more creatively?\n\nSo far I've come up with the following ideas:\n\n* Ditch the laptop and invest in a slim keyboard for my tablet\n* Become okay with carrying a backpack with me at conferences, rather than a shoulder/crossbody bag \n\nDo any of you have creative solutions to this kind of problem? Maybe I'm looking for something impossible, but I'm hardly the only person to want to travel light with a laptop. \n\nThanks!",

I'm torn as to what would be the best backpack for an EDC and maybe short trips for business or day hiking then I found this Skule Top 26L. I just wanted a bag where I can fit my work laptop in and some of my clothes and thought 26L should work just fine. Has anybody tried this backpack out before? Compared to the Kanken, how is it? I feel like at this point, I might as well get a backpack made out of metal. The bags I used in the past have broken down, it hasn't even lasted me a whole year before it's starting to look a little worn out. I've tried outdoor brand backpacks that are built to last but they don't last that long. Thanks in advance! Do you also have any recos?",

            "body": "Hey - Dylan here from Almond Oak :)\n\nI mentioned at the bottom of my story that I’m not a big fan of social media at all. I deleted all my social media back in 2021 because I think it’s one of the worst things to happen to modern society. But I also get that it’s the best way to reach like-minded people and connect with those who share the same vision, which is why I started back up again. Here’s my Instagram: [https://www.instagram.com/dylanlief/](https://www.instagram.com/dylanlief/)\n\nThe timing of this thread is actually kind of funny because I’ve been planning to start a YouTube channel to document everything - building the brand, creating new products, and my own one bag travels. Here’s the channel I’ll be posting on: [https://www.youtube.com/@dylanlief](https://www.youtube.com/@dylanlief)\n\nI’m also on LinkedIn, lol, under my full name. I just haven’t made an ‘Almond Oak’ LinkedIn page because I’m still working full-time to support getting this business off the ground.\n\nAnd just to clear things up - **I’ve already placed the bulk order with my supplier**. The reason I priced the bag so low on Kickstarter is to give it the best shot at success and get it into as many hands as possible. I genuinely believe this is the perfect backpack for one bag travel, and several YouTube reviewers have already shared their thoughts on it.\n\nIf you’re worried that I won’t follow through, I don’t know what more I can do. I’ve shared my entire story, I’m the face of the Kickstarter video, and this is literally my dream. I’m pricing the bag as affordably as possible because I want as many one baggers as possible to try it and help get this business off the ground.\n\nThis brand is the culmination of 5 years of tireless work trying to make something meaningful. I finally feel like I’ve found what I’m meant to do, and I have a vision for the perfect products I want to create for one bag travel. This is just the first one.\n\nIf you think I’m going to run off with $50k and not pursue my dream, then I don’t know what else to say. Maybe this bag isn’t for you. But for those who see the vision - I appreciate you more than you know.\n\n\\-Dylan",

        "selftext": "I bought the Gregory Tetrad 40 and used it once when I returned from Santa Fe to Seattle. Here are my initial impressions. Hopefully this will be helpful to anyone who is considering it. Overall I'm happy with it. The best thing is the suspension system and the worst is the laptop/tech compartment. This bag is reasonable alternative to the Osprey Farpoint 40.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Front view](https://preview.redd.it/9f6dnxg35ij31.jpg?width=2885&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=528773fd3a12ba0c7cacc202ca7526caa68048f7)\n\n**About me and why I bought this one**\n\nI'm new to one bag travel. Most of the time I travel I do short carries from my house to the airport via train or cab and then when I arrive getting to the rental car facility. I don't need much - I could lug a 20lb 40 liter duffel bag if I had to and that wouldn't be too bad. Or a rolling carry-on with small day pack. But when I visited New York several months ago I spent a lot of time hauling a bag several blocks to the subway, descending the steps, getting to my train and transferring to other trains, navigating through the train station, taking shuttles at the airport, etc. and I want this process to be easier next time. It would be a breeze going hands-free with a backpack. Maybe someday I'll do a lot of extensive traveling - hopping from one city to another via train - and I wanted to buy a bag I could use for this purpose. Also, I recently became intrigued by the idea of travelling with less and hope it might make travelling more enjoyable.\n\nI purchased a backpack from DSPTCH based on reviews from Chase Reeves and was very excited when it arrived. I loved the color, indestructible ballistic nylon, the design, beefy zippers, etc. When I loaded it up the total weight was around 21lb and it was uncomfortable to carry around the block - I started to feel strain in my neck and shoulders. I'm a strong and athletic 5' 9\" guy. The main problem was that the bag did not have a decent weight-bearing hip belt. For a true minimalist the answer is to just take a lot less, in which case you don’t need a hip belt. But I thought I did a good job paring down my stuff and had trouble getting the total weight, including 15\" laptop, below around 20lb. I loaded up the AER Travel Pack and although the hip belt helped, the torso size was wrong and the bag pulled me backward (they removed load lifters). So I decided that a key criteria for me in choosing a bag was that it fit properly and have some of the features you'd find in a backpacking backpack - torso adjustment, load lifters, weight-bearing hip belt, breathable back-panel, and good shoulder straps. This ruled out a huge number of exciting bags. I tried the REI Ruckpack 40 and though it was comfortable, it is really a top-loader and I found it awkward to work with. I tried the Farpoint 40 at REI and even with help from the people there could not get the sternum strap in the right place - it felt like it was choking me. That pack does not have an adjustable torso and comes in exactly 2 sizes. Peak Designs was a pretty good fit despite not having a lot of adjustment. For 95% of my usage scenarios, the Peak Designs probably would have worked better than the Gregory. But I worried a bit about the weight, cost, didn't like the buckles, and thought the back panel might not have enough ventilation. Didn't have a chance to see the Eagle Creek or Tortuga.\n\nI chose the Gregory Tetrad 40 because it had a solid suspension system, adjustable torso, about 40 liters of space, clamshell opening, space for a laptop, and a reasonable price - $180.\n\n**Suspension**\n\nThe suspension system is very nice. I quickly walked about 1/2 mile through Seattle streets on a hot day with no fatigue or sweating. My back did not get very hot. The pack plus contents weighed about 18 pounds. I did not bring a laptop so it is possible that if I had an extra 5 pounds on the front of the pack it might feel awkward. I used the hip belt, load lifters, and sternum strap. You can adjust the torso to your specific body size by sliding the shoulder straps up or down; they are attached with Velcro. There is a small wire metal frame around the back that helps the pack keep its shape and distribute the weight to the hips. The back seems to have good padding and is breathable. I was able to get it adjusted nearly perfectly for my body at REI.\n\n[Back and straps](https://i.redd.it/ye7ol15gthj31.jpg)\n\n[Adjustable torso, Velcro](https://i.redd.it/f69o4mvhthj31.jpg)\n\n[Wire frame at top of shoulder straps](https://i.redd.it/mzaqr2vtuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Decent fit, close to body (raised it an inch after photo taken)](https://i.redd.it/bmp3lrxkthj31.jpg)\n\n**ActiveShield**\n\nThere is a permanently attached zipper-close bag inside the main body that is supposed to be used for dirty clothes and muddy boots. You can wipe it clean with a sponge. I tried to use it for shoes and dirty laundry and it worked fine to isolate these items. The problem is that it causes the base of the clamshell to be bumpy and then was not as satisfying to lay down my packing cubes. I felt the need to fill in the bumps with my jacket, belt, and other miscellaneous items. You can choose not to use it at all, in which case it smooshes down to the bottom.\n\n[Shield not used, mostly flat](https://i.redd.it/a9t7nreqthj31.jpg)\n\n[Shield open with stuff inside, not zipped up yet](https://i.redd.it/7s4mv14sthj31.jpg)\n\n**Laptop Storage**\n\nThe front of the pack has space for your laptop, tablet, clipboard, papers, magazines, Kindle, and other flat items. There is one big padded slot. I could fit a 15\" Surface Book 2 in there with some room to spare. It is padded on all sides. There is a smaller sleeve in front you could use for something else, but it is not padded on the front.\n\nThis is my biggest disappointment with the bag. For weight distribution it is best to have the laptop on the back. I also travel with a lot of flat items and I wish this section of the bag had more pockets and more structure. It just isn't satisfying to put my papers and other items in slots that are kind of wobbly. My computer or clipboard gives it some structure. I also wish the frontmost slot had padding so my Kindle (or Tablet) was protected if the bag got checked. The newer tech backpacks, like AER and Tortuga, do an awesome job with this. Most of the time I won't be checking the bag. And if it ever did get checked, I probably would have removed the tech items ahead of time to use during the flight or ride, so I don't anticipate this being a big deal. The FarPoint has a much nicer looking laptop area despite also being in the wrong place.\n\n[With 15\\\\\" Surface Book](https://i.redd.it/buefxemuthj31.jpg)\n\n[Before put anything in, kind of wobbly without structure](https://i.redd.it/vzvt978xthj31.jpg)\n\n**Cover**\n\nThe pack comes with a detached cover. They call it a 3-in-1 cover since it can protect against rain, provide security, and completely enclose the bag if it ever got checked or thrown in the bottom of a bus.\n\nThe cover is somewhat bulky and durable - it doesn't compress well. They ship the bag to you with the cover in the quick access pocket on the top of the bag but I'd never put it in that prime real estate.\n\nI believe the cover is very waterproof; there are taped seams on the inside.\n\nIt took a little while to figure out how to use the cover. One way to use it is to just cover the front of the bag, which provides rain and security protection, but leave the back straps exposed. You need to roll up the zippered flap and store it at the base of the cover so it isn't in the way. When my bag was stuffed pretty tight the cover still fit ok. I put the cover on like this before boarding the airplane. You definitely wouldn't want to try putting the pack inside the cover once you get to your seat and people are waiting behind you; that would probably take too much time. I wore it with the straps and once I got to my seat chucked it in the overhead bin upside down with straps facing up without zipping the cover closed. That worked fine. The flight attendant had to move it to another compartment and he had no problem using the single grab handle for that.\n\nAfter I got off the plane I zipped the whole thing closed, just to see how that worked. It creates a nice safely protected package (other than the front of the tech compartment). There is a single grab handle on top.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about the cover yet. I'll probably try to never use it unless there is massive rain, I'm deeply concerned about security, or someone forces me to check it or chuck it into the bottom of a bus. For the case of zipping away the straps, the Farpoint and REI Ruckpack is probably a simpler quicker solution that allows you to still access the contents of the pack.\n\n[Cover taken out of bag](https://i.redd.it/gj1qk5p1uhj31.jpg)\n\n[Cover on and not zipped up](https://i.redd.it/q7awx19buhj31.jpg)\n\n**Storage and quick access**\n\nThere are no water bottle slots. I put my water bottle in the large stash pocket on the front which is better for weight distribution anyway. I'm a little concerned the elastic material there will get stretched out - time will tell. The 1 liter fit ok but I'd feel better with a slightly narrower bottle that doesn't stretch out the pocket as much.\n\nI really like the quick access pocket on the top. It can hold a decent amount of stuff - glasses, small earphones, snack, pen, ticket, and phone.\n\nThe clamshell experience was pretty good. It doesn't open 100% but close enough. I tried loading all my things into the Farpoint 40 and the bags are very similar size. I didn't like the bumpy bottom caused by the ActiveShield. The lid of the clamshell has a zippered mesh pocket; you can't see the contents inside that well. It is easy to partially unzip the clamshell to get bigger items out of the top of it, like your 3-1-1 liquid kit.\n\nThere is a mesh zippered security pocket at the top of the clamshell. I didn't use it.\n\nOnce the compression straps are locked down the zippers are stuck and you can't get to the bottom of the pack, though you can still access items at the top. I don't think you can get into the tech pocket without loosening the compression straps.\n\n[Clamshell open, not fully packed out with my stuff](https://i.redd.it/1epr5bvfuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Top of clamshell lid, can't see through mesh that easily](https://i.redd.it/zzjvv31iuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Security pocket](https://i.redd.it/1cq7m8oluhj31.jpg)\n\n[Quick access at top, fits plenty of things](https://i.redd.it/xpdacx1nuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Stash pocket](https://i.redd.it/hdgds4ipuhj31.jpg)\n\n**Materials and miscellaneous**\n\nThe pack seems well made and with durable materials. The zippers are YKK though the main compartment zipper is not as beefy as I'd like and not as big as Farpoint. I'm hoping Gregory knows what they are doing here and that they won't break down. I like the plastic buckles - they are easy to work with.\n\nThere are lots of dangly straps and no keepers to stop that from happening.\n\nWhen fully packed out (without water bottle in stash pocket) the pack is 21\" long, 14\" wide, and about 9\" deep.\n\nMy biggest complaint has more to do with one-bag travel than this pack. I like having certain conveniences with me on the plane, and transferring those items from the backpack to a structureless packable day pack just before takeoff is a hassle. Transferring those items back into the backpack after I arrive is also a hassle. Functionally it is nicer to have my clothes (and other stuff I will not touch in transit) in a duffel and all my office and tech stuff (laptop, papers, magazines, pens, Kindle) and snacks and 3-1-1 kit in a small high quality day pack that I can use in transit under my seat and once I get there. The Osprey Duplex seemed like a promising idea but I wasn't able to try it out.",

            "body": "Great review. I work at a local outdoor retailer and onebag style packs in the 35-55L range are very popular right now. I had a customer a week ago come in and together we decided the tetrad was the best bag with a decent suspension that we carried in store. Nice to hear some real world reviews. I’m a Gregory fan myself for the fact that they like their gadgets and features. I’d never buy a Gregory - I do the smaller 25-35L onebag/ Ultralight thing - but I do appreciate what they offer the general public. Good stuff and I appreciated the pictures for reference.",

I'm not going out of country anytime soon (like gonna be a year or two at least). I'd be doing like either driving trips or train trips and only spending one night or maybe two nights. I'd be taking clothes, a travel book/book, my dslr camera, coat/raincoat, and maybe my computer (not sure). What size backpack would you recommend for light budget travel? I use an Osprey for hiking and love the feel of them.",

                "body": "I tried on the FarPoint and it didn’t fit me as well - the sternum strap was kind of choking me. The Gregory has totally adjustable torso size while the FarPoint comes in just two sizes - men’s and women’s. I assume if you’re “average” height either one will fit decently. If you’re mostly doing short walks to the hotel or something it probably doesn’t matter. I thought the tech pockets on the FarPoint seemed much nicer and appeared to have more attention to detail even though on both packs the laptop is in the wrong place. They both hold about the same. The Tetrad has a center stash pocket, which I like, and don’t think it has size water bottle holders. They have a different cover mechanism. The FarPoint is easy to zip up the straps at the last minute while the Gregory is a little more involved and can cover the entire pack and function just as a rain cover.",
