I had it extended, but forced it into the smaller size (zippers held up well), didn't really fit into the sizer when I tried again at Play, but I had lazily packed it and believe the issue was me using the laptop sleeve with a bunch of wool hats which I took out and shoved into my pant pockets lol\n\nIs this a new travel trip? Just bring the largest jacket with the most pockets, and you essentially get a second personal item? haha",

        "selftext": "Took a weeklong trip to the Amalfi Coast (only 5 days minus travel) with my boyfriend and took only a backpack.\n\nPictured:\nBags\n- Osprey Daylite 26+6\n- Longchamp foldable bag\n- crossbody purse\n- passport wallet\n\nShoes\n- white sneakers\n- brown sandals\n\nAccessories\n- gold hoop earrings\n- sunglasses\n- wide brim straw hat\n\nClothing\n- black satin pajama set\n- floral swimsuit\n- denim jacket\n- white oversized button down shirt\n- seersucker dress\n- cream colour cutout dress\n- patterned maxi dress \n- green two-piece jumpsuit\n- white two-piece linen mini skirt dress\n- two t-shirts (one black, one white)\n- long sleeve black shirt\n- blue jeans\n\nNot pictured\n- 2 bras, 5 thongs, 4 pairs of socks \n- loose, dressy, white silk tank top (somehow just slipped my mind when I was taking the pictures)\n- toiletries\n- phone/charging cord\n- Anker power bank\n- universal adapter\n- noise cancelling AirPods\n- book\n- clothesline\n- packtowl travel towel\n- detergent sheets\n(I’ll probably need to edit and add to this list if I remember anything else)\n\nOverall I was very happy with what I packed, although I did fail at my goal of packing the bag at only 26L and not using the expander. Had I removed the items I specify below, I think I could have done it since I was so close. Still room for souvenirs though, that’s all that matters! \n\nThe white two-piece skort mini dress and the green two-piece jumpsuit were easily the most versatile pieces I brought. Not only were they interchangeable, but the green top is reversible and can be tied different ways (it’s a crime Vetta went out of business). I included a few outfits in this post, but there were definitely more combinations with the t-shirts and silk tank top included. The white sneakers are Birkenstocks and were plenty comfortable for the days we knew we would be doing a lot of walking.\n\nThings I did not use and would not bring again were the denim jacket, seersucker dress, and straw hat (shocking, I know. It had so much potential, but it turns out I’m not a hat person. I frequently reapplied sunscreen to compensate). I really needed my book for this trip between the plane rides and the beach, but it did take up a lot of space. Might be time to look into ereaders.\n\nI know a lot of people would not dream of packing bulky jeans or cotton t-shirts, but I wore them with the white sneakers on travel days in cold airplanes and lounges so they never took up space in my bag. Plus, I wasn’t sure if it would ever cool down in the evenings enough to want either the jeans or long sleeve shirt (it didn’t). \n\nSink washing with detergent sheets and using the clothesline was very helpful, especially for my boyfriends clothes, so I would definitely bring those again.",

Had I removed the items I specify below, I think I could have done it since I was so close. Still room for souvenirs though, that’s all that matters! \n\nThe white two-piece skort mini dress and the green two-piece jumpsuit were easily the most versatile pieces I brought. Not only were they interchangeable, but the green top is reversible and can be tied different ways (it’s a crime Vetta went out of business). I included a few outfits in this post, but there were definitely more combinations with the t-shirts and silk tank top included. The white sneakers are Birkenstocks and were plenty comfortable for the days we knew we would be doing a lot of walking.\n\nThings I did not use and would not bring again were the denim jacket, seersucker dress, and straw hat (shocking, I know. It had so much potential, but it turns out I’m not a hat person. I frequently reapplied sunscreen to compensate). I really needed my book for this trip between the plane rides and the beach, but it did take up a lot of space. Might be time to look into ereaders.\n\nI know a lot of people would not dream of packing bulky jeans or cotton t-shirts, but I wore them with the white sneakers on travel days in cold airplanes and lounges so they never took up space in my bag. Plus, I wasn’t sure if it would ever cool down in the evenings enough to want either the jeans or long sleeve shirt (it didn’t). \n\nSink washing with detergent sheets and using the clothesline was very helpful, especially for my boyfriends clothes, so I would definitely bring those again.",

Had I removed the items I specify below, I think I could have done it since I was so close. Still room for souvenirs though, that’s all that matters! \n\nThe white two-piece skort mini dress and the green two-piece jumpsuit were easily the most versatile pieces I brought. Not only were they interchangeable, but the green top is reversible and can be tied different ways (it’s a crime Vetta went out of business). I included a few outfits in this post, but there were definitely more combinations with the t-shirts and silk tank top included. The white sneakers are Birkenstocks and were plenty comfortable for the days we knew we would be doing a lot of walking.\n\nThings I did not use and would not bring again were the denim jacket, seersucker dress, and straw hat (shocking, I know. It had so much potential, but it turns out I’m not a hat person. I frequently reapplied sunscreen to compensate). I really needed my book for this trip between the plane rides and the beach, but it did take up a lot of space. Might be time to look into ereaders.\n\nI know a lot of people would not dream of packing bulky jeans or cotton t-shirts, but I wore them with the white sneakers on travel days in cold airplanes and lounges so they never took up space in my bag. Plus, I wasn’t sure if it would ever cool down in the evenings enough to want either the jeans or long sleeve shirt (it didn’t). \n\nSink washing with detergent sheets and using the clothesline was very helpful, especially for my boyfriends clothes, so I would definitely bring those again.",

        "selftext": "Took a weeklong trip to the Amalfi Coast (only 5 days minus travel) with my boyfriend and took only a backpack.\n\nPictured:\nBags\n- Osprey Daylite 26+6\n- Longchamp foldable bag\n- crossbody purse\n- passport wallet\n\nShoes\n- white sneakers\n- brown sandals\n\nAccessories\n- gold hoop earrings\n- sunglasses\n- wide brim straw hat\n\nClothing\n- black satin pajama set\n- floral swimsuit\n- denim jacket\n- white oversized button down shirt\n- seersucker dress\n- cream colour cutout dress\n- patterned maxi dress \n- green two-piece jumpsuit\n- white two-piece linen mini skirt dress\n- two t-shirts (one black, one white)\n- long sleeve black shirt\n- blue jeans\n\nNot pictured\n- 2 bras, 5 thongs, 4 pairs of socks \n- loose, dressy, white silk tank top (somehow just slipped my mind when I was taking the pictures)\n- toiletries\n- phone/charging cord\n- Anker power bank\n- universal adapter\n- noise cancelling AirPods\n- book\n- clothesline\n- packtowl travel towel\n- detergent sheets\n(I’ll probably need to edit and add to this list if I remember anything else)\n\nOverall I was very happy with what I packed, although I did fail at my goal of packing the bag at only 26L and not using the expander. Had I removed the items I specify below, I think I could have done it since I was so close. Still room for souvenirs though, that’s all that matters! \n\nThe white two-piece skort mini dress and the green two-piece jumpsuit were easily the most versatile pieces I brought. Not only were they interchangeable, but the green top is reversible and can be tied different ways (it’s a crime Vetta went out of business). I included a few outfits in this post, but there were definitely more combinations with the t-shirts and silk tank top included. The white sneakers are Birkenstocks and were plenty comfortable for the days we knew we would be doing a lot of walking.\n\nThings I did not use and would not bring again were the denim jacket, seersucker dress, and straw hat (shocking, I know. It had so much potential, but it turns out I’m not a hat person. I frequently reapplied sunscreen to compensate). I really needed my book for this trip between the plane rides and the beach, but it did take up a lot of space. Might be time to look into ereaders.\n\nI know a lot of people would not dream of packing bulky jeans or cotton t-shirts, but I wore them with the white sneakers on travel days in cold airplanes and lounges so they never took up space in my bag. Plus, I wasn’t sure if it would ever cool down in the evenings enough to want either the jeans or long sleeve shirt (it didn’t). \n\nSink washing with detergent sheets and using the clothesline was very helpful, especially for my boyfriends clothes, so I would definitely bring those again.",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

I tried to find a sizer to take a picture but couldn’t find one so I just snapped a couple of underseat pics, so far it worked great and I liked how I could bring it on in unexpanded mode and then while on the plane I could expand it to throw any extra bulky items I had on into it seeing as though it wouldn’t get measured again on the rest of the trip.

I traveled by train with my family for a ski trip and I packed everything I needed for a week into it plus some shared stuff like my daughter slippers and pyjama for the night train change. I also used it daily for hiking and snowboarding. The front pocket is handy to store your beanie or gloves or just a pack of wet/dry tissues. It didn’t get wet during the heavy rain and snow day, zippers were fine even when I felt down doing 360. It feels great, it is just a pleasure to have it aside and it’s a pleasure to touch it. \nThe only downside that I do not like so far is getting it on my back. Straps are quite stiff and it takes more effort to fit the second hand and then to unwrap them sometimes.  And I still to discover the way to use sternum strap - now I didn’t find it comfortable or helping to relief the weight. \n\nOther than that this bag is close to perfect.",

I have a camping spork as my utensil, but sometimes it’s not that great for either scooping or stabbing.\n\nAlso, what size plane/seat are you on?

IMHO is a waste of time and resources. \n\nGood info on pack fitting here:\nhttps://www.hillpeoplegear.com/packfitment",

My reply was downvoted to the oblivion in another recent thread.\n\nThey say this backpack is too short to add a hip belt, because it will never rest on your hip bone with this dimension.\n\nIf you are like 6-feet tall, this should be the case. But I am not, so I try to work out of something.\n\nI attached the extra chest straps from Amazon at the end of the shoulder straps, which makes it a makeshift hip belt.\n\nThe result is disappointing. The knots I made could not keep the chest straps at the lowest points. The straps stayed above my tummy around the navel, but not my hip bone.\n\nIf you make them tight to distribute the weight of the backpack, you will feel restricted and even nauseous.\n\nThe makeshift belts help stabilising the backpack though.\n\nSo I made another makeshift to ease my pain. I wore a bum bag, which was firmly position on my hip bone. Then I let the backpack sat on the bum bag, so the weight is distributed to my hip bone through the bum bag.\n\nThe downside? It is not one-bagging anymore!\n\nI really wish Osprey will add loops or D-rings around the bottom of the shoulder straps, so you have an option to add your own hip belt.",
