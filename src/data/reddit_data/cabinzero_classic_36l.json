        "selftext": "I am returning from a trip from Alaska to LA and it was my first using the CZ classic plus 32. For the previous year I had been using the CZ military 36 but the one thing that I didn’t like was that it doesn’t open fully. It’s not well advertised but the classic plus and pro do open fully. \nI like everything about this pack with the one possible exception which I’ll say might change over time… my shoulders were hurting a bit without the sternum strap buckled. With it buckled the stress was off my shoulders so maybe that just the way it is. Also I’m getting old so my joints just hurt anyway. \nAnyway, I’ll just post some pics so you can see real world shots of this pack. I think it’s a great option as an affordable alternative to $300+ packs. I added some bungee for external storage which I used a lot. \nI paid $86 with a discount. ",

I was a little concerned with fitting everything with the souvenirs I bought (a wool sweater, Islander bag, and assorted Knick knacks, and some wool yarn), but I used the foldable tote bag and put the baggu purse in it when boarding, and voila!\nI think I would have packed one less t-shirt, but otherwise it was a good amount and variety of clothes. I did end up buying a dress, skirt, pants, and hat while on a shopping trip that would have reduced the need for some other clothes. But all in all, pretty successful, was able to pack things I bought on the trip, and was way happier walking along the cobblestone street and airports which dragging a wheelie bag! Aiming to go even lighter in the future, so open to tips and input as well!\n\nHappy onebagging y’all :)\n",

I've never had issues with being forced to gate check it, even with RyanAir, so there is that at least. Backpacks are so personal, it's hard to say whether one thing that someone else loves will work for you or not.   \n  \nOne thing I will say is that I will neverrrrrr travel with a bag like the bento bag. I don't travel with roller bags, and when I've done weekend trips with shoulder bags like that, I've basically immediately hated myself, even if they're not that heavy. The weight is never comfortably settled anywhere like a backpack is, so I end up switching from shoulder to shoulder and just... being very unhappy. Again, all bag choices are personal, but I think there's a reason you very rarely see bags other than backpacks or roller bags in one bag forums.",

The carry on dimensions I’m working to are 55x40x20cm, with a maximum weight of 10kg. I am seriously considering the Haize Project Clamshell 38, it’s a close match in size (20x35x55cm) so it seems ideal and I like the design. It’s also not too heavy at 1600g for the original version and 1450g for the X-PAC version. \n\nI have decided I want a clamshell style bag with at least 35 litres capacity, I would also like compression straps if possible to help pack it down when full and reduce the size when lightly packed. I’m not too bothered about laptop/tech carrying. Comfort does matter, I will likely be wearing it for a few hours at a time when full. It also has to be available to buy in the UK, I found Mukama who will send to the UK. I have been looking at the following alternatives:\n\nGoruck GR3 - 1950g, 51×33x19cm. Good size, it’s a bit heavy, also it’s quite expensive, but is otherwise a close match. \n\nBlack Ember Forge 40 Max - 2250g, 51x31x20–25cm. Heavy, it has a bigger capacity at 40L, but I won’t be able to use all of it because it is too deep at 25cm when fully loaded.\n\nSalkan The Carry-On 35L - 1900g, 55x31x22cm. It’s a bit cheaper, depth is 22cm which is slightly over, but has compression straps so could be reduced slightly. \n\nIf you have experience of any of these bags or can recommend alternatives it would be great to hear.

            "body": "Just got mine today &amp; am back as promised to give some thoughts - first impressions are outstanding. Very well constructed, everything feels super premium - definitely the nicest bag I've owned &amp; the best looking. Also got a set of medium front straps &amp; a shoulder pocket.\n\nIt's also got a TON of space - I feel like bag sizes are kind of like pant sizes where every brand is kind of different and you really need to try them on since 38l can mean different things the way they're set up. I traveled for a year+ out of a 40 liter, and even though this is 38l it feels like it's got significantly more space. I almost wonder if the 25 would have been big enough for me, but I'd rather have a little more space to accumulate stuff while traveling than too little so I don't end up with a 2nd bag.\n\n1680D material looks &amp; feels great &amp; has a nice matte look to it. The zippers feel good &amp; the zipper garages they tuck into are nice &amp; it feels like this will be a great bag for taking into monsoon season conditions in the tropics. \n\nEveryone's preferences are different, but I bought it for long-term travel in places where it rains a lot. I'll be living out of the bag for extended periods &amp; travel with camera gear &amp; laptop, and I like to keep all this stuff inside a single main compartment for extra safety rather than having a bunch of zippered pockets with my stuff spread out all over. I really like the 3/4 clamshell design - perfect for plopping a packing cube right into the bottom. Mine has bright orange interior - glad they went with bright colors that makes it easy to find things. \n\n The compartment on the top is a good size for shoving whatever you need quick access to. The two side compartments are handy - I don't know what I'd stuff in there yet, but depending on how jammed you have the main compartment, there's room for an extra water bottle in these pouches, or a good spot to stick a passport or things you might need quick access to but don't want in the top quick access compartment. The laptop compartment can accommodate a big laptop, my 13in feels tiny in there - the little admin pockets at the top aren't voluminous and won't fit big chargers, but it's fine for smaller stuff like a USB C cable and power adapter. \n\nThe water bottle pouches on either side are great - I really like that they're not elasticized at all since the elastic tends to wear out after a while and then you have floppy pouches. Tons of room, a 32oz Nalgene easily fits, and the cinch straps tighten to keep whatever you put in there in place. Would be great for a bottle on one side and tripod on the other. The fidlocks on the top cinch straps are really nice &amp; when these are closed they basically turn the bag into a top loader since the main compartment zips will stop there with the strap closed.\n\nLots of spots to attach stuff all over the bag if you want to add more stuff/straps/whatever. Side carry handles are nice. Shoulder straps seem nice, they're not super thick but they feel comfortable &amp; the harness system is really nice and has lots of padding against your back &amp; the ability to adjust the position so it rides higher or lower for different people is a big bonus. I really like that it can accommodate a removable hip belt which slides through the back panel I like the one I have from an old Black Diamond Sphynx 45l since it's super padded &amp; comfy &amp; plan to use it with this rather than buying Haize's waist belt for an extra $66. \n\nAt 3.5 pounds it's not the lightest bag out there &amp; since I take a lot of budget airlines with 7kg carry on limits I'm going to have to be careful &amp; creative with stuffing my pockets with chargers if they weight it at the airport, but I would rather have a bag that weighs an extra pound but will be comfortable for walking 10 miles a day &amp; keeps my stuff safe than an ultralight bag that makes me suffer &amp; doesn't offer the same protection. If the weight is a concern, the X-PAC version could be a good bet.\n\nSpent a month looking at every bag out there before convincing myself I needed this one. All in all, super happy with my purchase and have no regrets.",

Also good to hear your thoughts on the size of it, I’ve read that some travel bags compromise the size of the main compartment for a big laptop/tech compartment, but it sounds like this isn’t the case for this bag. Like you say i think it’s better to have a bit of extra room than not enough, you can always use the compression straps to reduce the depth. I was a bit unsure about the 1680D because it looks shiny in some photos, but you said it looks more matte, would you mind sending a photo of your bag? Thanks again.",

            "body": "Just got mine today &amp; am back as promised to give some thoughts - first impressions are outstanding. Very well constructed, everything feels super premium - definitely the nicest bag I've owned &amp; the best looking. Also got a set of medium front straps &amp; a shoulder pocket.\n\nIt's also got a TON of space - I feel like bag sizes are kind of like pant sizes where every brand is kind of different and you really need to try them on since 38l can mean different things the way they're set up. I traveled for a year+ out of a 40 liter, and even though this is 38l it feels like it's got significantly more space. I almost wonder if the 25 would have been big enough for me, but I'd rather have a little more space to accumulate stuff while traveling than too little so I don't end up with a 2nd bag.\n\n1680D material looks &amp; feels great &amp; has a nice matte look to it. The zippers feel good &amp; the zipper garages they tuck into are nice &amp; it feels like this will be a great bag for taking into monsoon season conditions in the tropics. \n\nEveryone's preferences are different, but I bought it for long-term travel in places where it rains a lot. I'll be living out of the bag for extended periods &amp; travel with camera gear &amp; laptop, and I like to keep all this stuff inside a single main compartment for extra safety rather than having a bunch of zippered pockets with my stuff spread out all over. I really like the 3/4 clamshell design - perfect for plopping a packing cube right into the bottom. Mine has bright orange interior - glad they went with bright colors that makes it easy to find things. \n\n The compartment on the top is a good size for shoving whatever you need quick access to. The two side compartments are handy - I don't know what I'd stuff in there yet, but depending on how jammed you have the main compartment, there's room for an extra water bottle in these pouches, or a good spot to stick a passport or things you might need quick access to but don't want in the top quick access compartment. The laptop compartment can accommodate a big laptop, my 13in feels tiny in there - the little admin pockets at the top aren't voluminous and won't fit big chargers, but it's fine for smaller stuff like a USB C cable and power adapter. \n\nThe water bottle pouches on either side are great - I really like that they're not elasticized at all since the elastic tends to wear out after a while and then you have floppy pouches. Tons of room, a 32oz Nalgene easily fits, and the cinch straps tighten to keep whatever you put in there in place. Would be great for a bottle on one side and tripod on the other. The fidlocks on the top cinch straps are really nice &amp; when these are closed they basically turn the bag into a top loader since the main compartment zips will stop there with the strap closed.\n\nLots of spots to attach stuff all over the bag if you want to add more stuff/straps/whatever. Side carry handles are nice. Shoulder straps seem nice, they're not super thick but they feel comfortable &amp; the harness system is really nice and has lots of padding against your back &amp; the ability to adjust the position so it rides higher or lower for different people is a big bonus. I really like that it can accommodate a removable hip belt which slides through the back panel I like the one I have from an old Black Diamond Sphynx 45l since it's super padded &amp; comfy &amp; plan to use it with this rather than buying Haize's waist belt for an extra $66. \n\nAt 3.5 pounds it's not the lightest bag out there &amp; since I take a lot of budget airlines with 7kg carry on limits I'm going to have to be careful &amp; creative with stuffing my pockets with chargers if they weight it at the airport, but I would rather have a bag that weighs an extra pound but will be comfortable for walking 10 miles a day &amp; keeps my stuff safe than an ultralight bag that makes me suffer &amp; doesn't offer the same protection. If the weight is a concern, the X-PAC version could be a good bet.\n\nSpent a month looking at every bag out there before convincing myself I needed this one. All in all, super happy with my purchase and have no regrets.",

Also good to hear your thoughts on the size of it, I’ve read that some travel bags compromise the size of the main compartment for a big laptop/tech compartment, but it sounds like this isn’t the case for this bag. Like you say i think it’s better to have a bit of extra room than not enough, you can always use the compression straps to reduce the depth. I was a bit unsure about the 1680D because it looks shiny in some photos, but you said it looks more matte, would you mind sending a photo of your bag? Thanks again.",

The carry on dimensions I’m working to are 55x40x20cm, with a maximum weight of 10kg. I am seriously considering the Haize Project Clamshell 38, it’s a close match in size (20x35x55cm) so it seems ideal and I like the design. It’s also not too heavy at 1600g for the original version and 1450g for the X-PAC version. \n\nI have decided I want a clamshell style bag with at least 35 litres capacity, I would also like compression straps if possible to help pack it down when full and reduce the size when lightly packed. I’m not too bothered about laptop/tech carrying. Comfort does matter, I will likely be wearing it for a few hours at a time when full. It also has to be available to buy in the UK, I found Mukama who will send to the UK. I have been looking at the following alternatives:\n\nGoruck GR3 - 1950g, 51×33x19cm. Good size, it’s a bit heavy, also it’s quite expensive, but is otherwise a close match. \n\nBlack Ember Forge 40 Max - 2250g, 51x31x20–25cm. Heavy, it has a bigger capacity at 40L, but I won’t be able to use all of it because it is too deep at 25cm when fully loaded.\n\nSalkan The Carry-On 35L - 1900g, 55x31x22cm. It’s a bit cheaper, depth is 22cm which is slightly over, but has compression straps so could be reduced slightly. \n\nIf you have experience of any of these bags or can recommend alternatives it would be great to hear. Thanks all. \n\n",

The laptop compartment can accommodate a big laptop, my 13in feels tiny in there - the little admin pockets at the top aren't voluminous and won't fit big chargers, but it's fine for smaller stuff like a USB C cable and power adapter. \n\nThe water bottle pouches on either side are great - I really like that they're not elasticized at all since the elastic tends to wear out after a while and then you have floppy pouches. Tons of room, a 32oz Nalgene easily fits, and the cinch straps tighten to keep whatever you put in there in place. Would be great for a bottle on one side and tripod on the other. The fidlocks on the top cinch straps are really nice &amp; when these are closed they basically turn the bag into a top loader since the main compartment zips will stop there with the strap closed.\n\nLots of spots to attach stuff all over the bag if you want to add more stuff/straps/whatever. Side carry handles are nice. Shoulder straps seem nice, they're not super thick but they feel comfortable &amp; the harness system is really nice and has lots of padding against your back &amp; the ability to adjust the position so it rides higher or lower for different people is a big bonus. I really like that it can accommodate a removable hip belt which slides through the back panel I like the one I have from an old Black Diamond Sphynx 45l since it's super padded &amp; comfy &amp; plan to use it with this rather than buying Haize's waist belt for an extra $66. \n\nAt 3.5 pounds it's not the lightest bag out there &amp; since I take a lot of budget airlines with 7kg carry on limits I'm going to have to be careful &amp; creative with stuffing my pockets with chargers if they weight it at the airport, but I would rather have a bag that weighs an extra pound but will be comfortable for walking 10 miles a day &amp; keeps my stuff safe than an ultralight bag that makes me suffer &amp; doesn't offer the same protection. If the weight is a concern, the X-PAC version could be a good bet.\n\nSpent a month looking at every bag out there before convincing myself I needed this one. All in all, super happy with my purchase and have no regrets.",

                "body": "Thanks for such a detailed review, glad to hear you are happy with it. Also good to hear your thoughts on the size of it, I’ve read that some travel bags compromise the size of the main compartment for a big laptop/tech compartment, but it sounds like this isn’t the case for this bag. Like you say i think it’s better to have a bit of extra room than not enough, you can always use the compression straps to reduce the depth. I was a bit unsure about the 1680D because it looks shiny in some photos, but you said it looks more matte, would you mind sending a photo of your bag? Thanks again.",

Context: One week vacation in southern Spain. \n\nThe bags:\nCabinzero Classic 44L and \nQuechua NH Escape 500 23L \n\nPhotos of the bags at the Vueling bag sizers. The Cabinzero in the carry-on and the Quechua in the personal item. \n\nInside the Cabinzero there's an old Jansport Superbreak (not full) with all of the toddlers things which we could take out in order the use the space in the Cabinzero to bring back gifts (which we did).\n\nIf it interests anyone I can write a detailed post of the toddler's Jansport or my Quechua 23L (28 year old female, with a not so minimalist toiletry bag 😅).\n\nAt about 22L per person I'm very proud of how this load turned out for us and I think there's room for improvement. Given we had about a week of clothes per person, I'm confident we could travel for longer periods with the same load or lighter. ",

It seems this loadout fits nicely in your bag - though I do have to say I'm _confident_ you can further downsize 😉\n\nIn short, you're packing and wearing:\n\n* ⚠️ **13** tops\n* ⚠️ **8** underwear _(I assume you wear one)_\n* ⚠️ **2** swimsuits\n* ✅ **3** pants\n* ✅ **4** pairs of socks _(I assume you wear a pair)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can definitely reduce the amount of tops, maybe shave off 1-3 underwear and only bring a single swimsuit\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, I see most of your stuff is **black** - if you plan on spending time under ~~Helios~~ _**the sun***_ you'll get **really hot!** Lighter colours can _really_ help in keeping cool\n\nBeyond the sunscreen, I'd also suggest thinking about;\n\n* Hat/Cap _and/or_\n* Sunglasses\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen do you plan on going? Like you point out, the weather can be quite ''aggressive'' ahahaha - depending on dates and location\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Goal is to wash the clothes once on day 7\n\nHand washing takes a few minutes! I hand wash my clothes every night, hang to dry and it is ready by morning - \n\nThis is my [typical **indefinite** loadout](https://i.redd.it/5qune2tcbk4d1.jpg) for 3 seasons - \n\n* **4***+1*^(**✧**) 🩲 **Boxer Briefs**\n* **4***+1*^(**✧**) 🧦 Pairs of **Socks**\n* **4***+2*^(**✧**) 👕 **Top** Garments - _(1-2 long sleeve, rest short sleeves)_\n* **1***+1*^(**✧**) 👖 **Trousers** - _(1 convertible, 1 long trousers)_\n* **1** 💤 **Sleepwear/🧗🏻‍♂️ Activewear** set _(shorts, tank top)_\n* **1**^(**✧**) 👟 Pair of **shoes** _(trail running shoes)_\n\n\n\n^(**✧** - Refers to a) [^(**worn set,**)](https://i.redd.it/86mauk4cbk4d1.jpg) ^(not packed)\n\n※ On top of that I evidently have my [**toiletry** kit](https://i.redd.it/m6n4trocbk4d1.jpg), [**sleep** kit](https://i.redd.it/igfferwcbk4d1.jpg), [**electronics**](https://i.redd.it/wfwdrr1dbk4d1.jpg), [**laundry &amp; misc** kit](https://i.redd.it/vmzll2cdbk4d1.jpg), [travel **filmmaking gear**](https://i.redd.it/uy7ddm6dbk4d1.jpg), and [**medikit**](https://i.redd.it/1gs85dkcbk4d1.jpg) (I am T1D) - my entire loadout fits in an [**18L backpack** - 📋 _detailed packing list_](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1d7y2q1/45_weeks_in_japan_with_an_18l_backpack/)\n\n🧼 I **hand wash** socks and underwear every night and hang to air dry - it is all dry by morning. Tops are washed every 1-3 days, pants every 2-5 days or so - of course all depends on soil level and presence of smell or not\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor my inevitable Greece trip next year, that's the exact same loadout I plan on bringing - I've otherwise travelled for **32 days in Japan** with this exact loadout\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThough I see that you mention it is your **first onebagging trip** so I understand you prefer going with something more ''flexible'' for the first time ahahaha\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhatever the final loadout, \n\n* Good luck and have fun!\n* Make sure you learn from your experience for future trips _(what works, what doesn't - and adjsut accordingly)_\n* I always recommend trying out your loadout **for a week at home** to see how well it works\n* Remember about maybe substituting a few items to light-coloured ones as the sun will hit very hard on black clothes\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSafe travels!",

It seems this loadout fits nicely in your bag - though I do have to say I'm _confident_ you can further downsize 😉\n\nIn short, you're packing and wearing:\n\n* ⚠️ **13** tops\n* ⚠️ **8** underwear _(I assume you wear one)_\n* ⚠️ **2** swimsuits\n* ✅ **3** pants\n* ✅ **4** pairs of socks _(I assume you wear a pair)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can definitely reduce the amount of tops, maybe shave off 1-3 underwear and only bring a single swimsuit\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, I see most of your stuff is **black** - if you plan on spending time under ~~Helios~~ _**the sun***_ you'll get **really hot!** Lighter colours can _really_ help in keeping cool\n\nBeyond the sunscreen, I'd also suggest thinking about;\n\n* Hat/Cap _and/or_\n* Sunglasses\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen do you plan on going? Like you point out, the weather can be quite ''aggressive'' ahahaha - depending on dates and location\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Goal is to wash the clothes once on day 7\n\nHand washing takes a few minutes! I hand wash my clothes every night, hang to dry and it is ready by morning - \n\nThis is my [typical **indefinite** loadout](https://i.redd.it/5qune2tcbk4d1.jpg) for 3 seasons - \n\n* **4***+1*^(**✧**) 🩲 **Boxer Briefs**\n* **4***+1*^(**✧**) 🧦 Pairs of **Socks**\n* **4***+2*^(**✧**) 👕 **Top** Garments - _(1-2 long sleeve, rest short sleeves)_\n* **1***+1*^(**✧**) 👖 **Trousers** - _(1 convertible, 1 long trousers)_\n* **1** 💤 **Sleepwear/🧗🏻‍♂️ Activewear** set _(shorts, tank top)_\n* **1**^(**✧**) 👟 Pair of **shoes** _(trail running shoes)_\n\n\n\n^(**✧** - Refers to a) [^(**worn set,**)](https://i.redd.it/86mauk4cbk4d1.jpg) ^(not packed)\n\n※ On top of that I evidently have my [**toiletry** kit](https://i.redd.it/m6n4trocbk4d1.jpg), [**sleep** kit](https://i.redd.it/igfferwcbk4d1.jpg), [**electronics**](https://i.redd.it/wfwdrr1dbk4d1.jpg), [**laundry &amp; misc** kit](https://i.redd.it/vmzll2cdbk4d1.jpg), [travel **filmmaking gear**](https://i.redd.it/uy7ddm6dbk4d1.jpg), and [**medikit**](https://i.redd.it/1gs85dkcbk4d1.jpg) (I am T1D) - my entire loadout fits in an [**18L backpack** - 📋 _detailed packing list_](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1d7y2q1/45_weeks_in_japan_with_an_18l_backpack/)\n\n🧼 I **hand wash** socks and underwear every night and hang to air dry - it is all dry by morning.

Never done it tbh 😅 !\n\n\nI take a lot of tops because i sweat profusely and each top can only be worn 1 day before it smells.\n\n\nRegarding the black clothes, as a metalhead i have pretty much only black t shirts, save from the few deep blue and brown ones, i know its not ideal, but my three linen shirts are a bit lighter in shade, two light blue and a white (!!) one. \n\n\nCap and sunglasses are indeed a must (especially with my bald/shaved head!), and also packed, i just forgot to list them and can’t edit the original post sadly.\n\n\nIt’s actually my 2nd onebagging trip, first one was in London for a week for work and everything went well, but I feel like prepping for a week in early December London was somehow easier than 2 weeks in Greece. I did not have to plan to wash, and wardrobe was pretty much set for cold &amp; wet. (travelled with a suit and extra shirts, and one more casual attire for the weekend)\n\n\nBut it’s indeed my first « long » onebagging trip, my work only allows for 2 weeks break, so it’s probably the longest i’ll have to prep for in the foreseeable future, but it’s nice to know that this bag can do the job just fine.",

Curious what you think about that.\n\nI packed for a beach trip recently and couldn't understand why my bag was so heavy. Started weighing things and my beach shorts were a little over 1# each.

And finally, I narrowed my decision down to the beloved Cotopaxi and the lesser-recommended Thule. \n\nBoth bags are good. This is a hard decision. See both my pros and cons. \n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L\n\nPros \n- fits my torso (as a 5ft 2in woman)\n- has a removable hip belt\n- heavy duty, nice quality materials\n- was able to snag for $170\n- has nice zippered compartments on the inside to keep everything organized \n\nCons\n- it sits a little bit high on my shoulders and leaves a big gap between the back of my neck and the back top of the bag. Not sure if that’s how it’s supposed to fit but I don’t know if I like that. \n- the coating on the front of the bag seems like it could peel or scratch out down the line, as I’ve seen posted a few times. \n- no (quality) water bottle holder?? \n- the zippers are a pain, especially around the corners and in the top right. I’ve seen some write-ups about this too. It just will not close without effort, even when half packed. \n- looks frumpy when not packed to max capacity. \n\nThule Aion 40L\n\nPros\n- I adore the slate blue color AND the waxed canvas feel. I will like it even more as it starts getting scuffed and worn. \n- water bottle holder is such a win\n- zippers don’t snag or struggle like the Cotopaxi\n- less interior mesh pockets, but honestly this seems like a pro rather than a con. Keeps things simple. \n- Feels slightly lighter, and has a big laptop compartment. \n\nCons \n- the materials feel like they’re lower quality compared to the Cotopaxi. The waxed canvas is awesome, but the bag feels like it’s a bit thinner and less durable. \n- no hip belt without purchasing additionally \n- more expensive, I spent $210!\n- for a 40L backpack, I was actually able to pack MORE in the Cotopaxi during testing. \n- the one mesh pocket it does have inside doesn’t seem like it’ll last, it’s almost flimsy. \n\nWith all of this being said, I am still leaning towards the Thule. Which bag would YOU go with? 🙂",

I really liked it, it feels *super* sturdy and well-built, and a good size for my 5’7” frame. I used it both as a carryon and checked bag. It held up great, and I can confirm that the wax finish, water bottle holder, spacious interior, zippers, etc. are all wins.\n\nMy only cons:  \n- The back laptop sleeve is more robust than I prefer, as someone who rarely brings a laptop. I’d prefer it to be lighter and thinner / more unobtrusive when not in use.  \n- On a similar note, the plastic divider is pretty bulky if packed down into its stow compartment. I wish it fully unzipped so I could leave it at home.   \n- If I had the larger size, I’d be tempted to spring for the hip belt. The bag is very comfy to wear, but when fully loaded, even the smaller size was testing my patience a bit on the journey home. Walking was fine, standing around in customs lines was a bummer.\n\nBut I snagged mine for $90 with tags from the returns section of REI, so… I really can’t complain!",

        "selftext": "After weeks of trying to figure out what my first bag should be for international travel, I still couldn’t make up my mind. I watched every video and read every blog. And finally, I narrowed my decision down to the beloved Cotopaxi and the lesser-recommended Thule. \n\nBoth bags are good. This is a hard decision. See both my pros and cons. \n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L\n\nPros \n- fits my torso (as a 5ft 2in woman)\n- has a removable hip belt\n- heavy duty, nice quality materials\n- was able to snag for $170\n- has nice zippered compartments on the inside to keep everything organized \n\nCons\n- it sits a little bit high on my shoulders and leaves a big gap between the back of my neck and the back top of the bag. Not sure if that’s how it’s supposed to fit but I don’t know if I like that. \n- the coating on the front of the bag seems like it could peel or scratch out down the line, as I’ve seen posted a few times. \n- no (quality) water bottle holder?? \n- the zippers are a pain, especially around the corners and in the top right. I’ve seen some write-ups about this too. It just will not close without effort, even when half packed. \n- looks frumpy when not packed to max capacity. \n\nThule Aion 40L\n\nPros\n- I adore the slate blue color AND the waxed canvas feel. I will like it even more as it starts getting scuffed and worn. \n- water bottle holder is such a win\n- zippers don’t snag or struggle like the Cotopaxi\n- less interior mesh pockets, but honestly this seems like a pro rather than a con. Keeps things simple. \n- Feels slightly lighter, and has a big laptop compartment. \n\nCons \n- the materials feel like they’re lower quality compared to the Cotopaxi. The waxed canvas is awesome, but the bag feels like it’s a bit thinner and less durable. \n- no hip belt without purchasing additionally \n- more expensive, I spent $210!\n- for a 40L backpack, I was actually able to pack MORE in the Cotopaxi during testing. \n- the one mesh pocket it does have inside doesn’t seem like it’ll last, it’s almost flimsy. \n\nWith all of this being said, I am still leaning towards the Thule. Which bag would YOU go with? 🙂",

The Thule is going to put 100% of the weight on your shoulders. \n\n\nYou might also try the new REI Trail 40 women’s version that comes in three sizes. Of course there’s the Osprey Fairview 40 that has an adjustable torso length and women’s specific harness.",

I really liked it, it feels *super* sturdy and well-built, and a good size for my 5’7” frame. I used it both as a carryon and checked bag. It held up great, and I can confirm that the wax finish, water bottle holder, spacious interior, zippers, etc. are all wins.\n\nMy only cons:  \n- The back laptop sleeve is more robust than I prefer, as someone who rarely brings a laptop. I’d prefer it to be lighter and thinner / more unobtrusive when not in use.  \n- On a similar note, the plastic divider is pretty bulky if packed down into its stow compartment. I wish it fully unzipped so I could leave it at home.   \n- If I had the larger size, I’d be tempted to spring for the hip belt. The bag is very comfy to wear, but when fully loaded, even the smaller size was testing my patience a bit on the journey home. Walking was fine, standing around in customs lines was a bummer.\n\nBut I snagged mine for $90 with tags from the returns section of REI, so… I really can’t complain!",

        "selftext": "[36L CabinZero bag packed](https://i.imgur.com/v8w7o4P.jpg)\n\nI bought this bag in the Black Friday sale for £45 (RRP £60) and been itching to test it out. I was ermming and ahhing between the 28L and 36L bag as the former is advertised to be RyanAir compliant and I was wanting to use this bag for mostly short trips to Europe for the underseat/hand luggage only tickets. I decided to opt for the 36L bag because:\n\na) The dimensions of the bag was closer to 28L, though CZ insists that dimensions doesn't determine the capacity. \nb) I have flown with RyanAir several times before and have seen people take way bigger bags and reckoned this would pass. \n\nFirst of all, I LOVE the colour of this bag. The lavender colour really stood out in the sea of black bags, and I loved the contrast with the blue buckles. It will go with my summer and winter outfits. I like that there are compression straps as well. It's clamshell but not all the way, but this didn't bother me at all. \n\nI'm 5ft 3 and this didn't seem too enormous on me. It's basically a big fabric box on your back. There's minimal organisation, one small inside zip pocket and a larger outer zip pocket. There's a laptop sleeve as well but honestly it's so flimsy I would use a separate laptop case if I were to bring my laptop. \n\nThe climate was forecasted to be around 10-14 C during the day, mostly and drop more in the evening. Layers were important.\n\nOn my person: Jumper, trainers, jeans, top, bra, reversible jacket (the teddy lining side I would use when it's colder), beanie, scarf. My outfit [here](https://i.imgur.com/PnIY5mS.jpg).\n\n**What I packed:**\n\n* 4x knickers\n* 4x socks\n* Joggers\n* Sweatshirt\n* 4x tshirts/tops\n* Toiletries + makeup\n* Charger + adapter\n* Mirrorless camera + extra lens\n* Book\n* Journal + pen\n* Sunglasses\n* [Lefrik small backpack](https://i.imgur.com/iNwQhRm.jpg) (used as a day pack)\n* 750 ml water bottler\n* Flip flops\n\nI used two packing cubes, a med/large one for clothes and toiletries and a small one for undergarments. I fit the small one in the bigger one. The above brought my bag to 6kg (the bag itself is 800g I believe) and I definitely had room for more, but this amount filled it out quite nicely. I'm glad I did opt for the 36L because there is no way I would have fitted everything in the 28L and I felt I was quite minimalistic. \n\n[Picture of contents](https://i.imgur.com/yML2B3W.jpg)\n\n**Reflections**\n\nI felt that I packed the right amount of items. I didn't really use my mirrorless camera (this usually happens) so maybe I'll leave it home for future trips. \n\n[The bag did fit underneath the RyanAir seat.](https://i.imgur.com/k2hXH4Z.jpg)\n\nI DID experience achy shoulders if I wore the bag for more than 20 minutes. This wasn't too much of an issue as I was not on my feet for too long as I was either on transport or dropped off my luggage at the airbnb and used my day pack when out and about. \n\nOverall I liked this bag, especially the style. For the price I thought it was decently made and suited its purpose of getting my stuff from A to B. \n\nI will be going to Seville in March so will try it out again then, when the weather will be much warmer than this trip!",

            "body": "I took a new grey CPL24 on a short business trip. I took some pictures so people can get an impression what it's like on travel, I thought it was a bit missing when I considered this bag. Also I figured it wouldn't hurt to post pictures of the grey version, it's a bit rare to decide vs the black.\n\nIn particular the 2nd picture is the bag in a Ryanair personal item sizer, which is only 42x30x20cm. The bag doesn't fit without forcing the plate to bend. I think it's possible to cut a couple cm off the plate to make it compatible with Ryanair, but I think I'll just try it this way. They're not likely to ask for a backpack IMO.\n\nI took some pictures in a Lufthansa A320. You can see it fits vertically in the bins (so you can squeeze it between 2 luggages), and is fairly comfortable below the seat.\n\nWhile I'm at it, my quick opinion is that the bag is good for short travels, the organization is enough for me. I use a small packing cube (the large Minaal or small Peak Design, it fits just right in width). It's not abrasive, it's well constructed, it's practical to use, and the size is fine for short trips. The main drawback I'd mention is that it forces you to wear the straps fairly tight otherwise the bottom angle pushes just above your ass and it's uncomfortable. The fabric got a bit dirty somehow but it cleans up in a minute with some water.",
