It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it. ",

I really like it, I think it represents maybe the best, most dialed in, small backpack for laptop carry I have used.  I normally use a briefcase or even big sling for my everyday commute on the subway to my office, but sometimes I do need to carry more so I'll pull a backpack down from my wall.  My favorite laptop briefcase for work is a Waterfield Bolt (medium) briefcase, so I had my eye out for one of Waterfield backpacks.  Waterfield's stuff is mostly about laptop or tech carry, with a more workplace/business bent.  I picked this up on the B/S/T thread here.  Like my Bolt, this bag feels good and premium in the hand, the 1680d ballistic they use is supple and feels good and soft, not scratchy.  \n  \nThis bag is small, 16\"x11\"x6\", and I have a long torso so I wondered about fit.  Turns out fit is fine, its not really made to wear high on your back like an outdoors hiking bag, it fits well when given some slack and allowed to sit lower on the back, the straps have enough padding length to accomodate this.  Feels good on the back even with a heavy laptop in there.  In fact the straps, which do not look super burly have good structure and width and padding and feel like overkill when the bag is empty, but they work great when carrying that heavy laptop.  The size itself is also very good, and the bag has a good depth and volume despite its smaller footprint on the back, its plenty big in use and doesn't feel too much smaller than my next larger backpack the Bellroy Transit 22L (size comparison pic included).\n\nThe internal layout is super simple, and basically designed around easy access to the laptop, unlike some other half zips the ease of getting the laptop in and out is basically the same as any bag with a dedicated laptop sleeve, the laptop is right at the zipper and no amount of stuffing in the main compartment interferes with access.  On the body the bag feels great, even with a stiff laptop in the sleeve, many bags don't feel to great when a laptop is at your back, but this one still feels good.  This bags small dimensions also means it will pass most airlines sizers for a personal item, and there is a good amount of space to boot.  Dual bottle pockets should make the water bottle and symmetry loving folk happy.  I can give a recommend, this is my favorite sub 18L bag I've tried.  Though at $189 retail some may feel its a little steep, Waterfield is made in the USA and uses quality materials and hardware.",

            "body": "I got this in the other week and have used it enough to post my thoughts.  I really like it, I think it represents maybe the best, most dialed in, small backpack for laptop carry I have used.  I normally use a briefcase or even big sling for my everyday commute on the subway to my office, but sometimes I do need to carry more so I'll pull a backpack down from my wall.  My favorite laptop briefcase for work is a Waterfield Bolt (medium) briefcase, so I had my eye out for one of Waterfield backpacks.  Waterfield's stuff is mostly about laptop or tech carry, with a more workplace/business bent.  I picked this up on the B/S/T thread here.  Like my Bolt, this bag feels good and premium in the hand, the 1680d ballistic they use is supple and feels good and soft, not scratchy.  \n  \nThis bag is small, 16\"x11\"x6\", and I have a long torso so I wondered about fit.  Turns out fit is fine, its not really made to wear high on your back like an outdoors hiking bag, it fits well when given some slack and allowed to sit lower on the back, the straps have enough padding length to accomodate this.  Feels good on the back even with a heavy laptop in there.  In fact the straps, which do not look super burly have good structure and width and padding and feel like overkill when the bag is empty, but they work great when carrying that heavy laptop.  The size itself is also very good, and the bag has a good depth and volume despite its smaller footprint on the back, its plenty big in use and doesn't feel too much smaller than my next larger backpack the Bellroy Transit 22L (size comparison pic included).\n\nThe internal layout is super simple, and basically designed around easy access to the laptop, unlike some other half zips the ease of getting the laptop in and out is basically the same as any bag with a dedicated laptop sleeve, the laptop is right at the zipper and no amount of stuffing in the main compartment interferes with access.  On the body the bag feels great, even with a stiff laptop in the sleeve, many bags don't feel to great when a laptop is at your back, but this one still feels good.  This bags small dimensions also means it will pass most airlines sizers for a personal item, and there is a good amount of space to boot.  Dual bottle pockets should make the water bottle and symmetry loving folk happy.  I can give a recommend, this is my favorite sub 18L bag I've tried.  Though at $189 retail some may feel its a little steep, Waterfield is made in the USA and uses quality materials and hardware.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/comments/1es1s8m/acne_musubi_midi_bag_review/",
        "selftext": "I’ve posted quite a bit before about how my trusty Senreve Maestra has lasted me 5 years now as a daily work bag. Over the last few months it’s deteriorated a bit to the point where the puncture holes no longer hold the metal bits together so my bag is constantly open or incorrectly adjusted (like the straps fall to the longest length instead of what’s comfortable). While I could have probably fixed this, I also got a big promotion recently and decided it was a good opportunity for a new work bag! This review is for the Acne Musubi Midi in that daily work bag context. Also, I take the subway to work everyday.\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nDesign/Aesthetics: 9/10\n\nI love the slightly slouchy look, the origami feel, the thicker straps and the overall balance of the design. I really wanted something with more “design” than a basic tote and this definitely accomplished that. My only gripe that keeps this from being 10/10 is that when I bought it (I got it online) I thought the brown was going to be just a bit warmer. It’s a rather cool brown, which I still like and I really wanted a darker brown bag. But I was hoping for just a bit more warmth to the hue.\n\nCapacity and security: 7/10\n\nI convinced my boss to let me get a 13 inch laptop. I thought this would open me up to a lot more good bags. It turns out that this bag fits the laptop, but it’s slightly tight vertically so that the button clasp that closes the bag only just snaps closed. I’m not sure I want to stretch the leather that way so I’m left not closing the bag, which isn’t ideal given I commute on the subway. I put my wallet and keys in the center zippered pouch so I think it’s OK security wise but not great. \n\nComfort: 10/10\n\nThe slouch and thick straps are excellent. Compared with the Senreve Maestra, which is boxy and firm, with thin straps, I’m having suuuuch a better time carrying this bag. It conforms to the body and feels gentle, and the thick straps are perfect for both shoulder and arm carrying. It doesn’t feel heavy and sometimes I feel unsure if I even have my laptop in the bag! I am 5’6 and the shoulder strap is the perfect length for my comfort. It’s also adjustable.\n\nQuality and price: 9/10\n\nI got the bag on sale at 24S for $1,100 + tax, it retails for $1,800. The quality feels quite high to me although I don’t know if I would pay full price for it. I was watching it for a while and had seen other colors on sale for the $1k-$1.3k range so the minute I saw the brown color go on sale I snagged it. I’m feeling very satisfied with my buy.\n\nOverall I love the bag, I wish it were just a TINY bit taller and warmer in color! Then it would be 10/10 for me I think. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/handbags/comments/1es1s8m/acne_musubi_midi_bag_review/",
        "selftext": "I’ve posted quite a bit before about how my trusty Senreve Maestra has lasted me 5 years now as a daily work bag. Over the last few months it’s deteriorated a bit to the point where the puncture holes no longer hold the metal bits together so my bag is constantly open or incorrectly adjusted (like the straps fall to the longest length instead of what’s comfortable). While I could have probably fixed this, I also got a big promotion recently and decided it was a good opportunity for a new work bag! This review is for the Acne Musubi Midi in that daily work bag context. Also, I take the subway to work everyday.\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nDesign/Aesthetics: 9/10\n\nI love the slightly slouchy look, the origami feel, the thicker straps and the overall balance of the design. I really wanted something with more “design” than a basic tote and this definitely accomplished that. My only gripe that keeps this from being 10/10 is that when I bought it (I got it online) I thought the brown was going to be just a bit warmer. It’s a rather cool brown, which I still like and I really wanted a darker brown bag. But I was hoping for just a bit more warmth to the hue.\n\nCapacity and security: 7/10\n\nI convinced my boss to let me get a 13 inch laptop. I thought this would open me up to a lot more good bags. It turns out that this bag fits the laptop, but it’s slightly tight vertically so that the button clasp that closes the bag only just snaps closed. I’m not sure I want to stretch the leather that way so I’m left not closing the bag, which isn’t ideal given I commute on the subway. I put my wallet and keys in the center zippered pouch so I think it’s OK security wise but not great. \n\nComfort: 10/10\n\nThe slouch and thick straps are excellent. Compared with the Senreve Maestra, which is boxy and firm, with thin straps, I’m having suuuuch a better time carrying this bag. It conforms to the body and feels gentle, and the thick straps are perfect for both shoulder and arm carrying. It doesn’t feel heavy and sometimes I feel unsure if I even have my laptop in the bag! I am 5’6 and the shoulder strap is the perfect length for my comfort. It’s also adjustable.\n\nQuality and price: 9/10\n\nI got the bag on sale at 24S for $1,100 + tax, it retails for $1,800. The quality feels quite high to me although I don’t know if I would pay full price for it. I was watching it for a while and had seen other colors on sale for the $1k-$1.3k range so the minute I saw the brown color go on sale I snagged it. I’m feeling very satisfied with my buy.\n\nOverall I love the bag, I wish it were just a TINY bit taller and warmer in color! Then it would be 10/10 for me I think. ",

            "body": "Ok ok ok... \n\nWhen this was announced, I absolutely hated it. The price, vagueness of materials, the weird marketing that wasn't unlike anything Bellroy- I just flat out didn't like the bag.\n\nFast forward a few days and I couldn't get my mind off that gorgeous Onyx colour. It reminds me of some volcanic stones I saw by the sea a few years back. Not quite black, not quite grey- but somewhere in between.\n\nSo I bit the bullet. $749 NZD ($450ish USD)  plus shipping and it was at my doorstep in less than 24 hours. Pretty impressive given it came from another country in the midst of a global pandemic.\n\nI will take some better photos tomorrow but first impressions are:\n\n1. It isn't as big as I thought it would be. Not a bad thing but 25L is pretty much my limit for EDC- anything larger then I am probably going to pick up a duffle or weekender.  The dimensions, especially width, make it look really wide but I see now that they measured at the very top of the bag where the flap folds. The body is a more manageable size.\n2. It's quite lightweight. I just thought it would be quite heavy given all the leather used and aluminium hardware but it's not bad at all. It isn't featherlight but I wouldn't call it obnoxiously heavy as something from Filson.\n3. Aesthetics wise, I think it's a good match. It doesn't look too heritage like a Filson, doesn't look too futuristic like a Peak Design, it's not military inspired like a GoRuck or Wandrd, nor is it leaning too much towards sleek streetwear like you'd get from AER or DSPTCH. I think this wouldn't look out of place while travelling with a technical lightweight jacket or heading down to a friend's house in a white shirt and jeans.\n\nI'm not sure if I will end up keeping this yet since hey it's a lot of money but for the moment I really am impressed. It's nowhere near worth the asking price but it is definitely a step above my other Bellroy stuff.",

I don't like massive water bottle pockets and for me, and also considering the size of the bag, the side pockets of this bag are just right. It's almost hard to find bags which will securely fit narrow bottles/flasks these days, and this one has two bottle pockets with elastic which is great if I need to carry water bottle plus an umbrella or coffee flask. \n\nI'm 5'2\" and I can still carry in my hand like a shopping bag, and as a tote and as backpack so all three forms really do work, although I would have preferred slightly longer shoulder straps with no hand carry (but I understand why it's the way it is). \n\nAnother great feature easily overlooked is that it has two zip pulls for the main compartment, most tote bags dont even have zipper closure (not a problem if it's a basic canvas tote, but to put some serious organization for laptop etc and still no secure closing the bag is ridiculous yet many tote bag makers continue to do that) this bag has two zip pulls which means you can open it from any direction (great for lefties).",

I can live with that, and zippers here work, though only 1 zipper from one side, is placed so if you hang on one shoulder you can reach with one hand and open. Not ideal, but ok.  \n- zippers are impossible to close unless 100% straight for the laptop department. This works a little bit better if you leave it in the detachable metal brace, I did that on my second trip.  \n- The straps on the shoulders are super tight, and can't be tightened or loosed while having the pack on my back, not even when using full force with two hands. They can also just be adjusted very slightly at a time because of the small green fixed strap holding the excess fabric on, making it almost impossible to adjust on the go as you take stuff in/out of the bag for use, and want to use it for something else. I thought it would get looser over time, did not happen.  \n- no chest strap - why? I have it loaded with 7kg now and all the weight is on the edge of my shoulders, i really sucked on the whole duration of my first trip. I then invested in a universal chest strap myself for 10€ that does not match the design, which does not work ideally but helps a bit. Should at least design one you could offer to people who have bought this.  \n- The shoulder straps are just too short for a normal person (I am 173cm tall, 64kg) (see pictures), they sit in your armpit making the back very uncomfortable to carry if you are only wearing a t-shirt or have it loaded with 7kg  \n- Why this cartoonish big Horizn logo on the bag, instead of none or a small stylish one?  \n- The logo strip on the front is stitched on each end, but glued on in the middle, it is now loose just after 2 weekends of use.  \n- Heavyweight material, eats up your cabin allowance, 700-800g higher than a similar Tight Pro Häglöfs Large  \n- The keychain holder easily falls off its place by itself, especially if accessing the compartment why on one shoulder on the go. Now I have carabine there instead, but I mean come one?  \n  \nFor 360€ with many basic design flaws is a rip-off, this is more a designer bag than a functional one.  \n  \nIf I could return this I would, and to the rest of you looking for a digital nomad-style backpack, please avoid this and hopefully Horizon can make the next version of this backpack match the quality of the rest of their products.  \n  \nYou can buy 3x North Face Borealis Classic Backpacks to this price that are 3x times as functional, durable, and adjustable.",
