They replaced the broken zipper and even replaced the pull tab (I'm not sure what to call the little cord string attached to the zipper pulls) on ALL the zippers just to be nice.\n\nAs has been mentioned, you do need to take care of the TPU - mine started flaking and cracking a few years ago, but to be fair I had it for 10+ years at that point.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\n  \nEdit: wanted to clarify that the zipper replacement was free, covered under their warranty.

The flag can be easily removed / reattach to the bag without damaging the bag\n- once the flap is removed, the whole work flow is much better\n- mine is ql2.1 version which is easily enough , but I haven’t tried ql3.1 so dont know how they compare \n- my bike rear rack arrive a week after my vario ps arrive so I’ve been cycling with carrying it on my bag to work for a week (30 mins journey each way) and I find it is okay and similar to a regular backpack\n- the bag is heavier than my previous bag but the difference is not huge when it’s on your shoulder\n- cycling with it on the rear rack is much enjoyable than cycling it on my shoulder! But my bike is a 15kg e-bike so it does not make too much difference\n- my bike does not have kickstand so it is tricky to “park”. Leaning the bike on a rack might not stabilise it enough like before due to the weight distribution changes. So I always need to pick up the bag from rack before parking the bike.",

Here's my review based on heavy use (daily going to/from work, flipping the flap from pannier mode to back pack mode twice a day) over what I'd consider a long enough period of time to reasonably assess its durability. \n\nPros:\n\n\\- great mounting system (I use the quick-lock 3.1 system) - it locks in and out like a charm each time, and is super-fast;\n\n\\- The bag is strong and incredibly durable, I feel like it's going to last for many years to come;\n\n\\- Plenty of storage space (26 L), fits my lunch, laptop, over-ear headphone case, knick-knacks and a spare shirt;\n\n\\- Roll closure system makes is water-tight and easy to use - no risk of broken zippers;\n\n\\- Ortlieb stand by their product - I damaged the waterproofing on a previous one, and they explained that was because I failed to let it fully dry out (true), which all checks out in terms of the performance expectations of the materials used in the waterproofing. They still offered to replace it free of charge (I didn't take them up on this offer due to the hassle involved in shipping it);\n\n\\- It's a very comfortable, well-padded backpack;\n\n\\- It doesn't have too many storage compartments, which I prefer;\n\n\\- The side pouch is the perfect size to store items you need to access while it is mounted eg keys, bike lights, water bottle;\n\n  \nCons:\n\n\\- Feels pretty heavy, even when lightly packed\n\n\\- The roll-closure buckle loop is starting to tear and fray, so the buckle catches when it is opened, and I fear the loop will tear of completely in a few years;\n\n\\- Near daily flipping of the flap to change the bag from a pannier to a backpack has cracked the outer and inner waterproof lining at the creases of the bag - however, it is still largely waterproof, and I still pack a laptop in it in heavy rain (though only have a 30 minute commute);\n\n\\- Could do with a lot more reflective material; only one side is reflective - I can't understand why this isn't on every side and seem;\n\n\\- It's pretty rigid and deep, so it takes a bit of ferreting around to get at stuff, and can be hard to reach stuff at the bottom of the pack.\n\n\\- pretty expensive\n\nAll up, the pros totally outweigh the cons. I'd give it 4 out of 5, and not hesitate to get one again.",

The last point might be a pro rather than the con then. \n\nAs you can easily free up both of your hand and arm by putting it on your shoulder while other pannier you might need to hold it /  from your shoulder (as shoulder bag). \n\nI would highly recommend to remove the flap if you rear rack is tall enough. It makes the experience of using much more enjoyable.

It’s a single large compartment, simple but super functional. Unfortunately, the newer versions are truly trash that wouldn't even last a year.\n\nI’ve been eyeing the Ortlieb Messenger Bag as a potential replacement—it seems solid and checks all of the boxes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zoc3mhhb7dte1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b0a8efbf08c0c074779655460ff62514c08f0fb\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/looking-for-a-large-single-compartment-rolltop-backpack-v0-gpxhs9pyyrse1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c4ad5704402900cb872c25898a13dd6e27c61b5)\n\nBut is that really the only option out there for a waterproof, rolltop, single-compartment backpack over 35L? I’m having a hard time finding alternatives. While I love a long-lasting bag (this is BIFL after all), I’m also open to more affordable options that might not last a decade but still get the job done.\n\nAny suggestions?",

The ortleib system is fantastic, but it does require that the hook can fully close to prevent the bag from bouncing off the rack. \n\nA new rack is going to be cheaper if you count the cost of your time.
