The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff!

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

Its top poked out a bit but was not in the way.\n* ‚öñÔ∏è The packed backpack weighed **5.8 kg** _(12.7 lbs)_ and the waist pouch &amp; organizer weighed **1.3 kg** _(2.86 lbs)_\n\n\n\n* üå°Ô∏è **Weather** was colder than anticipated but I'm naturally hot super easily - I was fine with my long-sleeved henley _(and another layer underneath)_ but my family were constantly in fleece/coats/jackets ahahaha! In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "üéí **18L** Backpack ‚îÇ ‚úàÔ∏è **Japan** ‚îÇ üìÜ **March** 1st  - **April** 2nd\n___\n\n^(‚ö†Ô∏è Formatting is partially broken on SH.Reddit but fine on NEW.Reddit and OLD.Reddit - so annoying, I put a lot of effort in this submission!)\n\n\nHello fellow OneBaggers - I recently came back from a **32 day trip** in the _Land of the Rising Sun_ - _**JAPAN!**_ This was my 3rd time there and as with the other 2 trips it was absolutely amazing and memorable.\n\n#| **THE LOGISTICS**\n\nI spent 4.5 weeks with an 18L backpack as a T1D and with some travel filmmaking gear. **Due to T1D _(type 1 diabetes)_ I need to bring a ton of critical medical supplies** - I had a medikit with most of the supplies stored in my backpack but also always carried at least 2-days worth of daily supplies on myself, in a small waist pouch that also contained some other essentials.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also brought the fantastic **DJI Osmo Pocket 3 - Creator Combo** kit with a 3rd party lens kit and a travel tripod. The camera gear _(excluding the tripod)_ were stored in a small organizer wallet affixed to the waist pouch belt - both these pouches are pretty small and were not treated as ''bags'' by airlines. I could comfortably sit at my airplane seat with both bags around my waist.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe **18L backpack** contained everything else - items were mostly compartmentalized per category. I also packed a small 10L daypack, stored in the Border 18's Laptop Compartment. While venturing out I'd bring this small daypack with some essentials in it and the travel tripod - and since there are so many vending machines in Japan, I'd always have a ton of snacks and drinks. There are no public garbage bins in Japan so people are disciplined into carrying their own trash - the daypack was very useful to carry all the trash too.\n\nI'd hand wash my clothes every night if no washing machine was available but some accommodations did offer a washing machine. I'd therefore accumulate clothes _(mine and my relatives')_ before doing a wash\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Everything was used** in this trip. Some things were evidently used more than others, but every single item was used at one point^**1** - if not by me, by my relatives. This was a ''family trip'' of sorts, I went solo just a few times but I was mostly with my parents - it was my father's first time in Japan and my elder sister and I wanted to ensure he had an awesome time. My elder sister, her husband and their brand new baby were also travelling with us. For most accommodations I was with my parents, and we were all together a few times across the trip _(the 6 of us)_ - I've been to vacation apartments, hostels, hotels, ryokan and other travel rentals.\n\nWe've mostly used **public transportation** but we did rent a car for a particular 6-day road trip all around and across SHIKOKU - I've walked between 15,000 to 35,000 steps a day\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(**1** - Well, everything from my **original loadout** was used except the **red pen** never used that one... Also yeah I'll admit, I never used **Aspirin**, but I did give Advil and Tylenol to my parents and sister at some point. I did not _personally_ used **bandages** but I did use some on my pops that had cuts and scrapes on his leg. I lent my **USB-C to Micro-USB adapter** to my mother that only had USB-C cables but had a a power bank that used Micro-USB to recharge. **Large freezer-grade ziploc bags** were used often to store chopped fresh produce in the refrigerator a few times and smaller ziploc bags were often used to store leftovers - I didn't use some of the acquired items)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **SOUVENIRS**\n\nIn Japan, mailing stuff is super cheap so as I've done in my 2 previous Japan trips, I'd mail a ton of snacks and stuff back home. around 40$CAD for 4 kg _(8.8 lbs)_ of stuff! I shipped 2 parcels to myself and a few boxes to friends and colleagues\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut I did grab a few items during the trip: 2 **small deer charms**, 1 **small owl charm** in a nest made from Iya Valley Vine and recycled clothing fabric, a **small sewing kit**, an **extra nail clipper** used for **everything** _but_ nail clipping _(I got a nail clipper for nail clipping in my toiletry)_, **travel emergency cards**\n\nOn my way back I did go on a small shopping spree at NARITA AIRPORT and bought a bunch of last-minute stuff _(always snacks)_ - this grocery bag was treated as a ''Personal Item'' so no issues bringing it in the plane and storing it in an overhead compartment\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#| **DESTINATIONS** &amp;

In some family pictures it is hard to guess the weather as I'd be standing with rolled sleeves, shorts whilst my family would wear long pants and jackets. I definitely think most people would require warmer clothes if they lived the same experience.\n* üåßÔ∏è **It was raining or drizzling** 40-60% of the time and I didn't pack any rain accessory - I was definitely fine. When it was drizzling, the tiny droplets would evaporate as fast as they'd fall on me. There was at least 1 day where there was heavy rain but I simply borrowed one of the accommodation's umbrella.\n* üîÅ **If I had to redo the same trip**, I'd definitely bring the [Peak Design POV Kit for Capture](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/pov-kit?variant=10151309148204) and the [Peak Design Capture Camera Clip](https://ca.peakdesign.com/products/capture) - I decided _**not**_ to bring them literally minutes before heading to the airport, and while I evidently survived the trip without them, having them would've increased efficiency and convenience tenfold for the camera AHAHAHAH! They really would've simplified ''workflow'' for filming and really help in ergonomics with the camera. I'll definitely bring both on my next trip! \n* üîÅ I also forgot to pack the [**Cellphone Holder**](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B09X1K5WW9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) that came with the travel tripod - really would've allowed for some great shots with my cellphone - I had no way to anchor it to the tripod _(but at least used the tripod on many occasions with my Osmo Pocket 3)_\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTime for me to wrap this up! Thank you so much for reading and thank you for your support! Many Redditors were interested in the packing list and provided very kind comments over various interactions across multiple communities - your kind words mean a lot to me!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n‚ùì _If you have any question, **ask away!**_",

        "selftext": "My first real hiking trip with a backpack and camping gear was a great success! We traveled to Luxembourg by train and enjoyed the beautiful Mullertal there. \n\nOn the images you can see everything I've brought for the trip. As a 'beginner' I'm not even close of having all the high end gear but in my opinion I first wanted to get a feel for it and if I liked it get more serious about doing camping and hiking trips. \n\nWell this and other trips I did last summer were a great success! I brought my Naturehike Cloud up 2 with me in the Gregory Zulu 55L. The sleeping bag is from Decathlon and rated at 10 degrees Celsius comfort. I've got a small stove from Amazon with 100g Primus gas. A Nemo Fillo pillow which was great together with a Trekology UL80 made for not too terrible of nights. Although felt lacking.\n\nWhat I learned from this trip are a few things: \n- Bring a chair or something with back support because my back started to hurt after just sitting on the grass all the time. I bought a used Therm a rest trekking chair where my mat fits in. It's very light.\n\n- I like the Cloud Up 2 and it performed great but I really want a tent which is more roomy for your head and has side Acces. I couldn't really 'chill' in this tent and the front access was difficult. I'm looking into the Naturehike Star River 2 now which is basically the Cloud Up 2's bigger brother\n\n- Good hiking boots are extremely nice to have in a rainy and slippery environment\n\n- A powerbank of 10.000 mah doesn't really have 10K but more close to 6K. 20.000 mAh would be better to have. \n\n- my weight had some margin. At 12KG the bag felt good and didn't hurt even after 40 km's. \n\n- The Trekology UL80 was good in terms of comfort and warmth but not wide enough for me. I'll upgrade to a Nemo Astro insulated wide+long. \n\n- food, drink and clothes wise I think I did great and didn't feel like I missed anything. \n\nThe new Star River 2 tent, the improvised chair and new Nemo Astro will make my pack roughly 600 grams heavier. Like I said I had some margin in weight and a good sleep and to be able to chill makes a world of a difference to me and worth that extra can of beer in weight.\n\nCurious, what do you think? Any more tips? Feel free to ask questions as well.",

I bought a used Therm a rest trekking chair where my mat fits in. It's very light.\n\n- I like the Cloud Up 2 and it performed great but I really want a tent which is more roomy for your head and has side Acces. I couldn't really 'chill' in this tent and the front access was difficult. I'm looking into the Naturehike Star River 2 now which is basically the Cloud Up 2's bigger brother\n\n- Good hiking boots are extremely nice to have in a rainy and slippery environment\n\n- A powerbank of 10.000 mah doesn't really have 10K but more close to 6K. 20.000 mAh would be better to have. \n\n- my weight had some margin. At 12KG the bag felt good and didn't hurt even after 40 km's. \n\n- The Trekology UL80 was good in terms of comfort and warmth but not wide enough for me. I'll upgrade to a Nemo Astro insulated wide+long. \n\n- food, drink and clothes wise I think I did great and didn't feel like I missed anything. \n\nThe new Star River 2 tent, the improvised chair and new Nemo Astro will make my pack roughly 600 grams heavier. Like I said I had some margin in weight and a good sleep and to be able to chill makes a world of a difference to me and worth that extra can of beer in weight.\n\nCurious, what do you think? Any more tips? Feel free to ask questions as well.",

As a 'beginner' I'm not even close of having all the high end gear but in my opinion I first wanted to get a feel for it and if I liked it get more serious about doing camping and hiking trips. \n\nWell this and other trips I did last summer were a great success! I brought my Naturehike Cloud up 2 with me in the Gregory Zulu 55L. The sleeping bag is from Decathlon and rated at 10 degrees Celsius comfort. I've got a small stove from Amazon with 100g Primus gas. A Nemo Fillo pillow which was great together with a Trekology UL80 made for not too terrible of nights. Although felt lacking.\n\nWhat I learned from this trip are a few things: \n- Bring a chair or something with back support because my back started to hurt after just sitting on the grass all the time. I bought a used Therm a rest trekking chair where my mat fits in. It's very light.\n\n- I like the Cloud Up 2 and it performed great but I really want a tent which is more roomy for your head and has side Acces. I couldn't really 'chill' in this tent and the front access was difficult. I'm looking into the Naturehike Star River 2 now which is basically the Cloud Up 2's bigger brother\n\n- Good hiking boots are extremely nice to have in a rainy and slippery environment\n\n- A powerbank of 10.000 mah doesn't really have 10K but more close to 6K. 20.000 mAh would be better to have. \n\n- my weight had some margin. At 12KG the bag felt good and didn't hurt even after 40 km's. \n\n- The Trekology UL80 was good in terms of comfort and warmth but not wide enough for me. I'll upgrade to a Nemo Astro insulated wide+long. \n\n- food, drink and clothes wise I think I did great and didn't feel like I missed anything. \n\nThe new Star River 2 tent, the improvised chair and new Nemo Astro will make my pack roughly 600 grams heavier. Like I said I had some margin in weight and a good sleep and to be able to chill makes a world of a difference to me and worth that extra can of beer in weight.\n\nCurious, what do you think? Any more tips? Feel free to ask questions as well.",

We traveled to Luxembourg by train and enjoyed the beautiful Mullertal there. \n\nOn the images you can see everything I've brought for the trip. As a 'beginner' I'm not even close of having all the high end gear but in my opinion I first wanted to get a feel for it and if I liked it get more serious about doing camping and hiking trips. \n\nWell this and other trips I did last summer were a great success! I brought my Naturehike Cloud up 2 with me in the Gregory Zulu 55L. The sleeping bag is from Decathlon and rated at 10 degrees Celsius comfort. I've got a small stove from Amazon with 100g Primus gas. A Nemo Fillo pillow which was great together with a Trekology UL80 made for not too terrible of nights. Although felt lacking.\n\nWhat I learned from this trip are a few things: \n- Bring a chair or something with back support because my back started to hurt after just sitting on the grass all the time. I bought a used Therm a rest trekking chair where my mat fits in. It's very light.\n\n- I like the Cloud Up 2 and it performed great but I really want a tent which is more roomy for your head and has side Acces. I couldn't really 'chill' in this tent and the front access was difficult. I'm looking into the Naturehike Star River 2 now which is basically the Cloud Up 2's bigger brother\n\n- Good hiking boots are extremely nice to have in a rainy and slippery environment\n\n- A powerbank of 10.000 mah doesn't really have 10K but more close to 6K. 20.000 mAh would be better to have. \n\n- my weight had some margin. At 12KG the bag felt good and didn't hurt even after 40 km's. \n\n- The Trekology UL80 was good in terms of comfort and warmth but not wide enough for me. I'll upgrade to a Nemo Astro insulated wide+long. \n\n- food, drink and clothes wise I think I did great and didn't feel like I missed anything. \n\nThe new Star River 2 tent, the improvised chair and new Nemo Astro will make my pack roughly 600 grams heavier. Like I said I had some margin in weight and a good sleep and to be able to chill makes a world of a difference to me and worth that extra can of beer in weight.\n\nCurious, what do you think? Any more tips? Feel free to ask questions as well.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1bw6mp1/osprey_farpoint_40_vs_gregory_border_40/",
        "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

The Gregory Border can be found in black for $189 on a handful of sites. I wasn't thrilled about the black, but saw that a site in the Netherlands called outdoorxl had the brown on sale.  After shipping (which only took 3 days!), the bag was about $209, so I figured what's $20 more if I like it better and it will last a long time.  Both bags used to be available in more colors.  The fact that they haven't been restocked online makes me wonder if a new model will be coming out in the near future.",

The carry system on the Osprey is unmatched and we really felt it on walks even five minutes or more. The packing organization on the border is way better BUT it can make you feel like you can pack more than you should since the pack gets fat and the weight just gets further from your back and the bag even less ergonomic. If you carry less than 7 kg than the border is awesome! But any more weight and the Osprey becomes the winner.",

Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

        "selftext": "I have been referenced this sub a lot before purchasing a bag for my trip to Alaska next month.  Now that I have pulled the trigger, I thought I would post about my experiences with two bags, the Osprey Farpoint 40 and the Gregory Border 40.  \n\nIn Alaska I will be facing varied temperatures and weather.  Due to this, and the fact that I'm new and won't be getting by with at 25L pack just yet, I bought the Osprey Farpoint 40L, which I tested last weekend on a short trip home.  Right after buying the Osprey I read about the Gregory Border 40 and felt like it might have more to offer.  After the weekend, I felt the Osprey left something to be desired so I ordered the Gregory Border.  Although I have yet to use the Gregory, I am pretty sure it will work better for me for a number of reasons.  Below I will half assedly lay out what I like and dislike about both bags.  I have also attached a few photos of both bags that will hopefully show what I am talking about.   Just for comparison sake, the last pic I included shows the Osprey, Gregory, and the Cotopaxi 35L which my g/f bought for the trip side by side.   \n\nFirst the osprey:  lots of people mention how comfortable it is and I would agree.  The internal frame and sizable hip belt make wearing the bag a  comfortable experience, but seems like it might be overkill for most situations. This also makes the pack heavier and a bit bulkier.  The bag is also oddly shaped and it seems less conducive to holding packing cubes.  It reminds me of having a turtle shell on your back.  There is a weird pocket in the front that might hold a water bottle but it's a bit awkward.  Speaking of pockets, there is a lack of them on the outside and inside.  I do like how the pack has the compression straps on the outside so you can cinch the bag smaller.  There is a weird foam divider thing inside the bag that I don't really understand.  After trialing the Osprey, I decided to order the Gregory and I can already tell it offers more of what I am looking for.\n\nThe Gregory Border 40 has a zip up water bottle pocket, lots of internal pockets including one for shoes and one for dirty clothes, and pockets on the outside of the bag as well.  The shape seems more streamlined.  It has hip belts, and though they won't be as load bearing as the Osprey, I don't expect that my bag will weigh a ton or that I will be wearing it for more than an hour or two.  Compared to the Osprey the handles and material aren't quite as tough, but I think they will be fine.   The Osprey has a better way of protecting the straps with a zip up cover, but the Gregory has the ability to tuck them under the padding on the back of the bag (pic 3).\n\nI'm not sure I will return the Osprey just yet, but I am convinced the Gregory will deliver more of what I am looking for.  I can tell lots of folks on here are passionate about their bags, so I'm not really looking to debate the merits of one bag vs the other, but rather share what features I liked about two popular models in the hopes that it helps others in the future.  \n\nI am always floored to find subs with people so passionate about flashlights, or mattresses, or backpacks or whatever, but always grateful for the advice and the time people put into their posts.\n \nThanks for all of your efforts and happy traveling!",

Wish it did not go so high as the pack is stuck being tall. But perfect otherwise. \n\nMy idea, cut the bag open, cut the back part to a shorter size, then sew back together. But not wanting to ruin the durability of the bag.\n\nAny feedback would be great! Thanks",

But until consumers stop buying bags which _don't_ spec the standard, market forces will prevail.\n\nIt's good to know about ASTM F2153-07, but I find thinking of \"bag class\", then use actual measurements and other research to be more predictive of bag performance.",

Getting the family ready for a one bag trip and I‚Äôve noticed that some bags seem drastically different than their advertised size. \n\nI ordered a cheap Amazon backpack for my man-sized teenager and am returning it for quality issues (it had good reviews). It was advertised at 40 liters but the capacity is comically smaller than that, especially when compared to my husband‚Äôs old Kelty redwing which is also supposed to be 40 liters. \n\nI splurged on an Away travel backpack a few years ago and I adore the bag, but just noticed it‚Äôs advertised at 25.5 L. It can hold a good bit but it doesn‚Äôt feel like a 25L bag to me. Then I picked up a Vera Bradley pack (which I did not expect to be my unicorn bag but here we are) and it‚Äôs stated at 24L but it holds so much. It‚Äôs larger in 2 out of 3 dimensions than the away bag. \n\nObviously some bags make more efficient use of space than others, but is it common for capacity assessment to be just flat out incorrect?",

A \"35L class bag\" may be anywhere from like 28L-39L(ish).\n\nIt's why getting good reviews, with pictures, especially within a sizer, is useful.\n\n. . . . . . . . .  \n\n#**Q: Is there a standardized measurement system for the volume of bags?**\n\nA: Yes, there is the standard measurement system of [ASTM F2153-07](https://www.astm.org/f2153-07r18.html). But until consumers stop buying bags which _don't_ spec the standard, market forces will prevail.\n\nIt's good to know about ASTM F2153-07, but I find thinking of \"bag class\", then use actual measurements and other research to be more predictive of bag performance.",

I‚Äôve never backpacked before so I don‚Äôt have a great idea on what I‚Äôll appreciate in a bag. Will be bouncing from city to city staying in hostels and taking atleast 6 flights while I‚Äôm there. From what I‚Äôve read/watched on YouTube I‚Äôve narrowed my search to bags with a capacity between 35-40 L around the $300 ish CAD. I won‚Äôt be packing any laptops or camera equipment, mainly just clothes and toiletries. Im currently looking at the Cotopaxi Allpa 35-42L or an Osprey Farpoint. Was hoping you guys would be able to steer me in the direction of the right bag, any other suggestions are welcome. Thanks!",

See both my pros and cons. \n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L\n\nPros \n- fits my torso (as a 5ft 2in woman)\n- has a removable hip belt\n- heavy duty, nice quality materials\n- was able to snag for $170\n- has nice zippered compartments on the inside to keep everything organized \n\nCons\n- it sits a little bit high on my shoulders and leaves a big gap between the back of my neck and the back top of the bag. Not sure if that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to fit but I don‚Äôt know if I like that. \n- the coating on the front of the bag seems like it could peel or scratch out down the line, as I‚Äôve seen posted a few times. \n- no (quality) water bottle holder?? \n- the zippers are a pain, especially around the corners and in the top right. I‚Äôve seen some write-ups about this too. It just will not close without effort, even when half packed. \n- looks frumpy when not packed to max capacity. \n\nThule Aion 40L\n\nPros\n- I adore the slate blue color AND the waxed canvas feel. I will like it even more as it starts getting scuffed and worn. \n- water bottle holder is such a win\n- zippers don‚Äôt snag or struggle like the Cotopaxi\n- less interior mesh pockets, but honestly this seems like a pro rather than a con. Keeps things simple. \n- Feels slightly lighter, and has a big laptop compartment. \n\nCons \n- the materials feel like they‚Äôre lower quality compared to the Cotopaxi. The waxed canvas is awesome, but the bag feels like it‚Äôs a bit thinner and less durable. \n- no hip belt without purchasing additionally \n- more expensive, I spent $210!\n- for a 40L backpack, I was actually able to pack MORE in the Cotopaxi during testing. \n- the one mesh pocket it does have inside doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll last, it‚Äôs almost flimsy. \n\nWith all of this being said, I am still leaning towards the Thule.

The mt500 air has a lot of space in lateral zipped spaces, which allows to recover the loss of internal space due to the curved arc system of load. Lateral spaces are very comfy both for long objects (tent poles, trekking poles, tripod for photos...) and comprimible things (tents tarp, jacket, 2L water bottle, axes, knife).  The biggest difference is that you can use and charge them also with full backpack on. On the stout is almost impossible and you cannot have rapid taking system of bottles like the mt500. Probably Stout holds 70-75 liters in the main compartment, MT500 stays on 45-50, but have 15-18 liters of lateral spaces and holds better (IMHO) a 2 days load material",

The mt500 air has a lot of space in lateral zipped spaces, which allows to recover the loss of internal space due to the curved arc system of load. Lateral spaces are very comfy both for long objects (tent poles, trekking poles, tripod for photos...) and comprimible things (tents tarp, jacket, 2L water bottle, axes, knife).  The biggest difference is that you can use and charge them also with full backpack on. On the stout is almost impossible and you cannot have rapid taking system of bottles like the mt500. Probably Stout holds 70-75 liters in the main compartment, MT500 stays on 45-50, but have 15-18 liters of lateral spaces and holds better (IMHO) a 2 days load material",
