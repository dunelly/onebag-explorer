            "body": "**Why the Raven 28?**\n\nThe [Raven 28](https://www.fjallraven.com/uk/en-gb/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/laptop-bags/raven-282) is admittedly a backpack that I’ve been curious about for over a year, mostly because of its great organization and materials. Fjallraven’s G-1000 waxed canvas might not be as durable as something like Cordura, but I consider it to be nicest materials out there, and the Raven 28 seemed to be like Fjallraven’s most versatile backpack made in this material.\n\nTheir Ulvo backpacks use BERGSHELL (also nice and water-resistant but not as thick) and their more sporty-looking Skule 28 is made of polyester. I really like waxed canvas and I figured it would be nice to check out a bag that uses such a comfortable earthy material, but is also tech-friendly, spacious and has lots of pockets.\n\nI didn’t get the Raven 28 sooner because of a huge drawback: the lack of back padding. This is generally a dealbreaker for me because I like to have at least some padding, ventilation and/or mesh on the back panel. The Raven 28 had none of that and that was my only reason for not pulling the trigger.\n\nHowever, ***this year Fjallraven released an updated version of the Raven 28*** that comes with a mesh back panel and also some other minor updates. So that gave me the green light to get the new updated version and I’ve been very happy with it so far! It’s cool that Fjallraven is a company that listens to customers and they enthusiastically gave a promising backpack such a needed upgrade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Materials**\n\nI already admitted my love for the G-1000 material. It’s soft, supple and feels quite strong, although I’ve seen comments about the older Raven 28 model that the bottom of the bag tends to wear out after a few years. Maybe the updated version has some reinforced stitching there, I don’t know, but Fjallraven definitely recommends re-waxing the material with their Greenland Wax occasionally to protect the material and maintain its durability.\n\nI think waxing canvas is a nice process and if I decide to keep the Raven 28, I’ll be sure to re-wax mine early next winter and add a few extra layers to the bottom just in case. It should be noted that G-1000 picks up lots of hair and lint, so dog owners beware. It also gets creases easily. The G-1000 should be highly water-resistant and while the YKK zippers are not AquaGuard or anything, there are flaps covering each zipper to keep water out.\n\nThere are some nice leather accents on the bag too, including the carry handle and the logo on the front. These touches make the bag feel more premium. The leather arctic fox logo on the front is one of the nicest branding touches I've seen on a backpack, it's super cute yet classy.\n\nMy Raven 28 is the in the dark olive color. I like Fjallraven’s earthy colors a lot. When I was getting familiar with the Raven at the store, the Terracotta Brown and Foliage Green colors really caught my eye as well. They just pop!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI was worried about the comfort because the Raven 28 is perhaps a bit more boxy than I’d like and as a 188cm guy I generally prefer taller, slimmer bags like the Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21 (which was in fact my daily carry before the Raven 28). I actually have to say that the bag is comfortable enough. It works for me personally because the Raven 28 is a surprisingly rigid pack and I tend to like the stiff rigid ones.\n\nI believe there’s a soft frame sheet inside the Raven 28 which provides structure, so switching from the UA21 (which has a plastic frame sheet inside) wasn’t such an alarming leap. I wish the Raven 28 had more cushiony shoulder straps, because the straps are also quite hard and I feel like they might rub into my shoulders if I carried lots of weight and had just a T-shirt on. However, in the winter when I wear my parka, the shoulder straps feel perfectly adequate and I’m sure they might break in over time too.\n\nSince there’s not much distance between the shoulder straps at the top of the bag, the Raven 28 might not work on people with large necks and shoulders. But for me, the comfort is alright. It’s doesn’t blow my mind but I don’t find it uncomfortable either so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nI’ve learned from experience that I gravitate towards bags that either have minimal organization where I have to resort to using organizer pouches, or bags that have lots of organization. The Raven 28 falls in the latter category, and boy does it deliver.\n\nThis is one of the few backpacks I’ve had where I could let go of my tech pouch and just use the internal pockets provided by the backpack while also leaving the main compartment completely empty. The organization possibilities in the Raven 28 are so rich that I could fit my laptop, tablet, Switch, e-reader, power bank, essentials pouch, charger, mouse, external hard drive, and minor random stuff into its different compartments and not even touch the main compartment at all.\n\nThe Raven 28 has a nice felt-lined top quick access pocket (one of my favorite features in backpacks), a front quick access pocket (just a little zippered sleeve with no internal organization), a spacious front admin section (two zippered mesh pockets, three sleeves and lots of extra space), and a zippered laptop compartment that has a padded laptop sleeve and a smaller tablet sleeve.\n\nThe laptop compartment is generous enough that I can actually fit my laptop, Switch, tablet and e-reader all in there and zip it up. The front admin section is big enough to actually hold my huge tech pocket and also other items. I still use my tech pocket (Aer’s Slim Pouch) because that makes it easy to remove all my tech items at once if I prefer to leave them home, but if I wanted to, I could easily fit my tech items into the various sleeves and mesh pockets.\n\nThere’s also a zippered mesh pocket in the main compartment which I use for snacks. The Raven 28 really benefits from having an accordion-like design: it can fold together nicely if it’s semi-empty but if I need to fill it up it can really expand and become actually quite boxy. I love that there is dedicated space in the front admin section, so when I stuff it full of items it doesn’t eat up any room in the main compartment.\n\nSo this is one of those backpacks that can be used as a weekend trip bag and I wouldn’t even be surprised if I could use it for a full-week trip: it can definitely hold all of the stuff that I already listed AND a big packing cube. The Raven 28 also has two water bottle sleeves. They are made of G-1000 and have no stretch whatsoever, but they are big enough to hold my rather big Klean Kanteen bottle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons**\n\n* While the water bottle sleeves are spacious, a smaller bottle may slide out if you lean down. I had a Red Bull can in one of the bottle pockets one day and it dropped out when I bent down to tie my shoelaces.\n* Webbing loops above the bottle sleeves on both sides are a nice addition, but they become kind of unusable if you have bottles in both sleeves. Maybe they could be a bit higher? I do find the webbing loops useful though because I clip my little LED light on one of them!\n* The Raven 28 has very poor balance and will never stand up no matter how you pack it. You will really have to make it sit diagonally against the wall so it wouldn’t fall forward (like in my photos).\n* I think the Raven 28 would really benefit from having an optional sternum strap and maybe a little more cushiony shoulder straps.\n* This is just personal preference, but I think the bag would feel a bit more streamlined if it were taller and thinner like Fjallraven’s Skule 28.\n* One of the zippered mesh pockets in the front admin section has a really nice built-in keyclip. It's nice, but logically it would be more practical if this keyclip were in the top quick access pocket instead.",

Fjallraven's cotton-based material does absorb water. That being said, I think spraying it with something like Nikwax or generously adding a few layers of Fjallraven's own Greenland Wax will greatly improve its water-resistance (posts on the Fjallraven subreddit confirms this). Perhaps a brand new G-1000 item isn't very heavily waxed to begin with. I think the Raven 28 is safe to wear in light rain but not in a downpour.",

I love that there is dedicated space in the front admin section, so when I stuff it full of items it doesn’t eat up any room in the main compartment.\n\nSo this is one of those backpacks that can be used as a weekend trip bag and I wouldn’t even be surprised if I could use it for a full-week trip: it can definitely hold all of the stuff that I already listed AND a big packing cube. The Raven 28 also has two water bottle sleeves. They are made of G-1000 and have no stretch whatsoever, but they are big enough to hold my rather big Klean Kanteen bottle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons**\n\n* While the water bottle sleeves are spacious, a smaller bottle may slide out if you lean down. I had a Red Bull can in one of the bottle pockets one day and it dropped out when I bent down to tie my shoelaces.\n* Webbing loops above the bottle sleeves on both sides are a nice addition, but they become kind of unusable if you have bottles in both sleeves. Maybe they could be a bit higher? I do find the webbing loops useful though because I clip my little LED light on one of them!\n* The Raven 28 has very poor balance and will never stand up no matter how you pack it. You will really have to make it sit diagonally against the wall so it wouldn’t fall forward (like in my photos).\n* I think the Raven 28 would really benefit from having an optional sternum strap and maybe a little more cushiony shoulder straps.\n* This is just personal preference, but I think the bag would feel a bit more streamlined if it were taller and thinner like Fjallraven’s Skule 28.\n* One of the zippered mesh pockets in the front admin section has a really nice built-in keyclip. It's nice, but logically it would be more practical if this keyclip were in the top quick access pocket instead.",

            "body": "**Why the Raven 28?**\n\nThe [Raven 28](https://www.fjallraven.com/uk/en-gb/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/laptop-bags/raven-282) is admittedly a backpack that I’ve been curious about for over a year, mostly because of its great organization and materials. Fjallraven’s G-1000 waxed canvas might not be as durable as something like Cordura, but I consider it to be nicest materials out there, and the Raven 28 seemed to be like Fjallraven’s most versatile backpack made in this material.\n\nTheir Ulvo backpacks use BERGSHELL (also nice and water-resistant but not as thick) and their more sporty-looking Skule 28 is made of polyester. I really like waxed canvas and I figured it would be nice to check out a bag that uses such a comfortable earthy material, but is also tech-friendly, spacious and has lots of pockets.\n\nI didn’t get the Raven 28 sooner because of a huge drawback: the lack of back padding. This is generally a dealbreaker for me because I like to have at least some padding, ventilation and/or mesh on the back panel. The Raven 28 had none of that and that was my only reason for not pulling the trigger.\n\nHowever, ***this year Fjallraven released an updated version of the Raven 28*** that comes with a mesh back panel and also some other minor updates. So that gave me the green light to get the new updated version and I’ve been very happy with it so far! It’s cool that Fjallraven is a company that listens to customers and they enthusiastically gave a promising backpack such a needed upgrade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Materials**\n\nI already admitted my love for the G-1000 material. It’s soft, supple and feels quite strong, although I’ve seen comments about the older Raven 28 model that the bottom of the bag tends to wear out after a few years. Maybe the updated version has some reinforced stitching there, I don’t know, but Fjallraven definitely recommends re-waxing the material with their Greenland Wax occasionally to protect the material and maintain its durability.\n\nI think waxing canvas is a nice process and if I decide to keep the Raven 28, I’ll be sure to re-wax mine early next winter and add a few extra layers to the bottom just in case. It should be noted that G-1000 picks up lots of hair and lint, so dog owners beware. It also gets creases easily. The G-1000 should be highly water-resistant and while the YKK zippers are not AquaGuard or anything, there are flaps covering each zipper to keep water out.\n\nThere are some nice leather accents on the bag too, including the carry handle and the logo on the front. These touches make the bag feel more premium. The leather arctic fox logo on the front is one of the nicest branding touches I've seen on a backpack, it's super cute yet classy.\n\nMy Raven 28 is the in the dark olive color. I like Fjallraven’s earthy colors a lot. When I was getting familiar with the Raven at the store, the Terracotta Brown and Foliage Green colors really caught my eye as well. They just pop!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI was worried about the comfort because the Raven 28 is perhaps a bit more boxy than I’d like and as a 188cm guy I generally prefer taller, slimmer bags like the Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21 (which was in fact my daily carry before the Raven 28). I actually have to say that the bag is comfortable enough. It works for me personally because the Raven 28 is a surprisingly rigid pack and I tend to like the stiff rigid ones.\n\nI believe there’s a soft frame sheet inside the Raven 28 which provides structure, so switching from the UA21 (which has a plastic frame sheet inside) wasn’t such an alarming leap. I wish the Raven 28 had more cushiony shoulder straps, because the straps are also quite hard and I feel like they might rub into my shoulders if I carried lots of weight and had just a T-shirt on. However, in the winter when I wear my parka, the shoulder straps feel perfectly adequate and I’m sure they might break in over time too.\n\nSince there’s not much distance between the shoulder straps at the top of the bag, the Raven 28 might not work on people with large necks and shoulders. But for me, the comfort is alright. It’s doesn’t blow my mind but I don’t find it uncomfortable either so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nI’ve learned from experience that I gravitate towards bags that either have minimal organization where I have to resort to using organizer pouches, or bags that have lots of organization. The Raven 28 falls in the latter category, and boy does it deliver.\n\nThis is one of the few backpacks I’ve had where I could let go of my tech pouch and just use the internal pockets provided by the backpack while also leaving the main compartment completely empty. The organization possibilities in the Raven 28 are so rich that I could fit my laptop, tablet, Switch, e-reader, power bank, essentials pouch, charger, mouse, external hard drive, and minor random stuff into its different compartments and not even touch the main compartment at all.\n\nThe Raven 28 has a nice felt-lined top quick access pocket (one of my favorite features in backpacks), a front quick access pocket (just a little zippered sleeve with no internal organization), a spacious front admin section (two zippered mesh pockets, three sleeves and lots of extra space), and a zippered laptop compartment that has a padded laptop sleeve and a smaller tablet sleeve.\n\nThe laptop compartment is generous enough that I can actually fit my laptop, Switch, tablet and e-reader all in there and zip it up. The front admin section is big enough to actually hold my huge tech pocket and also other items. I still use my tech pocket (Aer’s Slim Pouch) because that makes it easy to remove all my tech items at once if I prefer to leave them home, but if I wanted to, I could easily fit my tech items into the various sleeves and mesh pockets.\n\nThere’s also a zippered mesh pocket in the main compartment which I use for snacks. The Raven 28 really benefits from having an accordion-like design: it can fold together nicely if it’s semi-empty but if I need to fill it up it can really expand and become actually quite boxy. I love that there is dedicated space in the front admin section, so when I stuff it full of items it doesn’t eat up any room in the main compartment.\n\nSo this is one of those backpacks that can be used as a weekend trip bag and I wouldn’t even be surprised if I could use it for a full-week trip: it can definitely hold all of the stuff that I already listed AND a big packing cube. The Raven 28 also has two water bottle sleeves. They are made of G-1000 and have no stretch whatsoever, but they are big enough to hold my rather big Klean Kanteen bottle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons**\n\n* While the water bottle sleeves are spacious, a smaller bottle may slide out if you lean down. I had a Red Bull can in one of the bottle pockets one day and it dropped out when I bent down to tie my shoelaces.\n* Webbing loops above the bottle sleeves on both sides are a nice addition, but they become kind of unusable if you have bottles in both sleeves. Maybe they could be a bit higher? I do find the webbing loops useful though because I clip my little LED light on one of them!\n* The Raven 28 has very poor balance and will never stand up no matter how you pack it. You will really have to make it sit diagonally against the wall so it wouldn’t fall forward (like in my photos).\n* I think the Raven 28 would really benefit from having an optional sternum strap and maybe a little more cushiony shoulder straps.\n* This is just personal preference, but I think the bag would feel a bit more streamlined if it were taller and thinner like Fjallraven’s Skule 28.\n* One of the zippered mesh pockets in the front admin section has a really nice built-in keyclip. It's nice, but logically it would be more practical if this keyclip were in the top quick access pocket instead.",

However, in the winter when I wear my parka, the shoulder straps feel perfectly adequate and I’m sure they might break in over time too.\n\nSince there’s not much distance between the shoulder straps at the top of the bag, the Raven 28 might not work on people with large necks and shoulders. But for me, the comfort is alright. It’s doesn’t blow my mind but I don’t find it uncomfortable either so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nI’ve learned from experience that I gravitate towards bags that either have minimal organization where I have to resort to using organizer pouches, or bags that have lots of organization. The Raven 28 falls in the latter category, and boy does it deliver.\n\nThis is one of the few backpacks I’ve had where I could let go of my tech pouch and just use the internal pockets provided by the backpack while also leaving the main compartment completely empty. The organization possibilities in the Raven 28 are so rich that I could fit my laptop, tablet, Switch, e-reader, power bank, essentials pouch, charger, mouse, external hard drive, and minor random stuff into its different compartments and not even touch the main compartment at all.\n\nThe Raven 28 has a nice felt-lined top quick access pocket (one of my favorite features in backpacks), a front quick access pocket (just a little zippered sleeve with no internal organization), a spacious front admin section (two zippered mesh pockets, three sleeves and lots of extra space), and a zippered laptop compartment that has a padded laptop sleeve and a smaller tablet sleeve.\n\nThe laptop compartment is generous enough that I can actually fit my laptop, Switch, tablet and e-reader all in there and zip it up. The front admin section is big enough to actually hold my huge tech pocket and also other items. I still use my tech pocket (Aer’s Slim Pouch) because that makes it easy to remove all my tech items at once if I prefer to leave them home, but if I wanted to, I could easily fit my tech items into the various sleeves and mesh pockets.\n\nThere’s also a zippered mesh pocket in the main compartment which I use for snacks. The Raven 28 really benefits from having an accordion-like design: it can fold together nicely if it’s semi-empty but if I need to fill it up it can really expand and become actually quite boxy. I love that there is dedicated space in the front admin section, so when I stuff it full of items it doesn’t eat up any room in the main compartment.\n\nSo this is one of those backpacks that can be used as a weekend trip bag and I wouldn’t even be surprised if I could use it for a full-week trip: it can definitely hold all of the stuff that I already listed AND a big packing cube. The Raven 28 also has two water bottle sleeves. They are made of G-1000 and have no stretch whatsoever, but they are big enough to hold my rather big Klean Kanteen bottle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons**\n\n* While the water bottle sleeves are spacious, a smaller bottle may slide out if you lean down. I had a Red Bull can in one of the bottle pockets one day and it dropped out when I bent down to tie my shoelaces.\n* Webbing loops above the bottle sleeves on both sides are a nice addition, but they become kind of unusable if you have bottles in both sleeves. Maybe they could be a bit higher? I do find the webbing loops useful though because I clip my little LED light on one of them!\n* The Raven 28 has very poor balance and will never stand up no matter how you pack it. You will really have to make it sit diagonally against the wall so it wouldn’t fall forward (like in my photos).\n* I think the Raven 28 would really benefit from having an optional sternum strap and maybe a little more cushiony shoulder straps.\n* This is just personal preference, but I think the bag would feel a bit more streamlined if it were taller and thinner like Fjallraven’s Skule 28.\n* One of the zippered mesh pockets in the front admin section has a really nice built-in keyclip. It's nice, but logically it would be more practical if this keyclip were in the top quick access pocket instead.",

            "body": "**Why the Raven 28?**\n\nThe [Raven 28](https://www.fjallraven.com/uk/en-gb/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/laptop-bags/raven-282) is admittedly a backpack that I’ve been curious about for over a year, mostly because of its great organization and materials. Fjallraven’s G-1000 waxed canvas might not be as durable as something like Cordura, but I consider it to be nicest materials out there, and the Raven 28 seemed to be like Fjallraven’s most versatile backpack made in this material.\n\nTheir Ulvo backpacks use BERGSHELL (also nice and water-resistant but not as thick) and their more sporty-looking Skule 28 is made of polyester. I really like waxed canvas and I figured it would be nice to check out a bag that uses such a comfortable earthy material, but is also tech-friendly, spacious and has lots of pockets.\n\nI didn’t get the Raven 28 sooner because of a huge drawback: the lack of back padding. This is generally a dealbreaker for me because I like to have at least some padding, ventilation and/or mesh on the back panel. The Raven 28 had none of that and that was my only reason for not pulling the trigger.\n\nHowever, ***this year Fjallraven released an updated version of the Raven 28*** that comes with a mesh back panel and also some other minor updates. So that gave me the green light to get the new updated version and I’ve been very happy with it so far! It’s cool that Fjallraven is a company that listens to customers and they enthusiastically gave a promising backpack such a needed upgrade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Materials**\n\nI already admitted my love for the G-1000 material. It’s soft, supple and feels quite strong, although I’ve seen comments about the older Raven 28 model that the bottom of the bag tends to wear out after a few years. Maybe the updated version has some reinforced stitching there, I don’t know, but Fjallraven definitely recommends re-waxing the material with their Greenland Wax occasionally to protect the material and maintain its durability.\n\nI think waxing canvas is a nice process and if I decide to keep the Raven 28, I’ll be sure to re-wax mine early next winter and add a few extra layers to the bottom just in case. It should be noted that G-1000 picks up lots of hair and lint, so dog owners beware. It also gets creases easily. The G-1000 should be highly water-resistant and while the YKK zippers are not AquaGuard or anything, there are flaps covering each zipper to keep water out.\n\nThere are some nice leather accents on the bag too, including the carry handle and the logo on the front. These touches make the bag feel more premium. The leather arctic fox logo on the front is one of the nicest branding touches I've seen on a backpack, it's super cute yet classy.\n\nMy Raven 28 is the in the dark olive color. I like Fjallraven’s earthy colors a lot. When I was getting familiar with the Raven at the store, the Terracotta Brown and Foliage Green colors really caught my eye as well. They just pop!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI was worried about the comfort because the Raven 28 is perhaps a bit more boxy than I’d like and as a 188cm guy I generally prefer taller, slimmer bags like the Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21 (which was in fact my daily carry before the Raven 28). I actually have to say that the bag is comfortable enough. It works for me personally because the Raven 28 is a surprisingly rigid pack and I tend to like the stiff rigid ones.\n\nI believe there’s a soft frame sheet inside the Raven 28 which provides structure, so switching from the UA21 (which has a plastic frame sheet inside) wasn’t such an alarming leap. I wish the Raven 28 had more cushiony shoulder straps, because the straps are also quite hard and I feel like they might rub into my shoulders if I carried lots of weight and had just a T-shirt on. However, in the winter when I wear my parka, the shoulder straps feel perfectly adequate and I’m sure they might break in over time too.\n\nSince there’s not much distance between the shoulder straps at the top of the bag, the Raven 28 might not work on people with large necks and shoulders. But for me, the comfort is alright. It’s doesn’t blow my mind but I don’t find it uncomfortable either so far\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nI’ve learned from experience that I gravitate towards bags that either have minimal organization where I have to resort to using organizer pouches, or bags that have lots of organization. The Raven 28 falls in the latter category, and boy does it deliver.\n\nThis is one of the few backpacks I’ve had where I could let go of my tech pouch and just use the internal pockets provided by the backpack while also leaving the main compartment completely empty. The organization possibilities in the Raven 28 are so rich that I could fit my laptop, tablet, Switch, e-reader, power bank, essentials pouch, charger, mouse, external hard drive, and minor random stuff into its different compartments and not even touch the main compartment at all.\n\nThe Raven 28 has a nice felt-lined top quick access pocket (one of my favorite features in backpacks), a front quick access pocket (just a little zippered sleeve with no internal organization), a spacious front admin section (two zippered mesh pockets, three sleeves and lots of extra space), and a zippered laptop compartment that has a padded laptop sleeve and a smaller tablet sleeve.\n\nThe laptop compartment is generous enough that I can actually fit my laptop, Switch, tablet and e-reader all in there and zip it up. The front admin section is big enough to actually hold my huge tech pocket and also other items. I still use my tech pocket (Aer’s Slim Pouch) because that makes it easy to remove all my tech items at once if I prefer to leave them home, but if I wanted to, I could easily fit my tech items into the various sleeves and mesh pockets.\n\nThere’s also a zippered mesh pocket in the main compartment which I use for snacks. The Raven 28 really benefits from having an accordion-like design: it can fold together nicely if it’s semi-empty but if I need to fill it up it can really expand and become actually quite boxy. I love that there is dedicated space in the front admin section, so when I stuff it full of items it doesn’t eat up any room in the main compartment.\n\nSo this is one of those backpacks that can be used as a weekend trip bag and I wouldn’t even be surprised if I could use it for a full-week trip: it can definitely hold all of the stuff that I already listed AND a big packing cube. The Raven 28 also has two water bottle sleeves. They are made of G-1000 and have no stretch whatsoever, but they are big enough to hold my rather big Klean Kanteen bottle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cons**\n\n* While the water bottle sleeves are spacious, a smaller bottle may slide out if you lean down. I had a Red Bull can in one of the bottle pockets one day and it dropped out when I bent down to tie my shoelaces.\n* Webbing loops above the bottle sleeves on both sides are a nice addition, but they become kind of unusable if you have bottles in both sleeves. Maybe they could be a bit higher? I do find the webbing loops useful though because I clip my little LED light on one of them!\n* The Raven 28 has very poor balance and will never stand up no matter how you pack it. You will really have to make it sit diagonally against the wall so it wouldn’t fall forward (like in my photos).\n* I think the Raven 28 would really benefit from having an optional sternum strap and maybe a little more cushiony shoulder straps.\n* This is just personal preference, but I think the bag would feel a bit more streamlined if it were taller and thinner like Fjallraven’s Skule 28.\n* One of the zippered mesh pockets in the front admin section has a really nice built-in keyclip. It's nice, but logically it would be more practical if this keyclip were in the top quick access pocket instead.",

        "selftext": "I had this pack for my birthday and I've been using it for a couple of months as ad EDC pack (I'm a taxi driver and after I stay out all day). Here's my review, hope it may be useful to someone.\n\nQuality 5/5\nThe quality of this backpack is astonishing. The G1000 fabric is thick and strong but at the same time soft and smooth. It is a pleasure to use. The zippers are YKK and work flawlessly, although the pulls are quite small. I plan to switch to some paracord pulls one day or another.\nThe leather handle and logos add to the premium feel.\nI absolutely LOVE it.\n\nStyle 4/5\nAlthough it's not as iconic as other packs the design is nice and clean. I love the fact that it doesn't looks out of place in any environment, from the woods to the office.\nI got mine in black but if you prefer there are a lot of nice colours to choose from.\n\nOrganization 5/5\nThe organisation is great. There are a couple of loops on the sides (added in the new version, the old one didn't have them), perfect to hold carabiners and shock cords to attach any sort of objects outside. There are also two sleeve pockets that I use for a water bottle and an umbrella. There's also a small pocket on the front, another compartment with admin panel and mesh zipped pockets. In the main compartment there's a laptop sleeve and another mesh pocket.\nLast but not least, there's also a small fleece lined pocket on the top that's a perfect fit for my Ricoh GRIII camera.\nAll your stuff will find a good spot to stay.\n\nRoom 2/5\nYou can't have it all. All the great organization steals quite a bit of space inside, so the pack is not very well suited to carry bulky objects. My other EDC backpack is a 16L and I easily use it for overnights (EDC + change of clothes, night clothes, toiletries and flip flops), in this one you have to squeeze your stuff a lot more and sometimes it just doesn't fit. But if you need more space you can still buy the 27L version.\n\nComfort 3/5\nDisclaimer: I suffer from back pain so I'm VERY picky when it comes to comfort. So maybe a normal person could give a higher score.\nThat said, the pack is a little short, doesn't have a sternum strap nor a waist belt. It doesn't have a frame either.\nThe shoulder straps are just ok, but I had packs with wider and softer ones. It is also on the heavy side.\nI wouldn't say it is uncomfortable, but if I had to carry it for hours everyday I'd surely go for something more structured and ergonomic.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it.\nBye 👍🏻",

Like you, I do find it is a small 20L though, but that being said my version is &lt;700g so easy to grab on my way out if I know I'm carrying only a few things/picking up a few small items whilst out. Compared to the other bags I've been looking or own (AER, Alpha One Niner, Goruck) it's about half the weight!\n\nI did try it as my work bag, but whilst it holds my work 15.6\" laptop and other EDC, it's a squeeze to get anything else in there. I did use the organisation in the front compartment, but found I prefer using a pouch and not having to remember which dedicated slot I put something in (when I emptied it out after deciding to stop using it as my work bag, I even forgot that my glasses were in another pocket for about 3 days - admittedly I don't wear them much!). The only other minor annoyances are the water bottle pockets not having any sort of elasticity and being a tad short if using a taller flask. For my Klean Kanteen TKWide flask's in 12oz and 16oz they're fine though.\n\nI'm getting over back pain too so have found I'm pretty sensitive to bags that don't fit well, but even though I'm 6'1\" this wears very well, and being small it's not easy to overfill it, so I'm not tempted to carry too much weight with it at least.\n\nIt's not a bag I expect to last forever but for what I paid it's decent enough value. Not sure I'd pay full price though but it can be found at a slight discount usually here (in the UK).",

Here's my review, hope it may be useful to someone.\n\nQuality 5/5\nThe quality of this backpack is astonishing. The G1000 fabric is thick and strong but at the same time soft and smooth. It is a pleasure to use. The zippers are YKK and work flawlessly, although the pulls are quite small. I plan to switch to some paracord pulls one day or another.\nThe leather handle and logos add to the premium feel.\nI absolutely LOVE it.\n\nStyle 4/5\nAlthough it's not as iconic as other packs the design is nice and clean. I love the fact that it doesn't looks out of place in any environment, from the woods to the office.\nI got mine in black but if you prefer there are a lot of nice colours to choose from.\n\nOrganization 5/5\nThe organisation is great. There are a couple of loops on the sides (added in the new version, the old one didn't have them), perfect to hold carabiners and shock cords to attach any sort of objects outside. There are also two sleeve pockets that I use for a water bottle and an umbrella. There's also a small pocket on the front, another compartment with admin panel and mesh zipped pockets. In the main compartment there's a laptop sleeve and another mesh pocket.\nLast but not least, there's also a small fleece lined pocket on the top that's a perfect fit for my Ricoh GRIII camera.\nAll your stuff will find a good spot to stay.\n\nRoom 2/5\nYou can't have it all. All the great organization steals quite a bit of space inside, so the pack is not very well suited to carry bulky objects. My other EDC backpack is a 16L and I easily use it for overnights (EDC + change of clothes, night clothes, toiletries and flip flops), in this one you have to squeeze your stuff a lot more and sometimes it just doesn't fit. But if you need more space you can still buy the 27L version.\n\nComfort 3/5\nDisclaimer: I suffer from back pain so I'm VERY picky when it comes to comfort. So maybe a normal person could give a higher score.\nThat said, the pack is a little short, doesn't have a sternum strap nor a waist belt.

            "body": "Thanks for the review. I've got the older version of this (bought it on sale after the new version was released) and I have to agree with you on it being a nice *little* bag. Like you, I do find it is a small 20L though, but that being said my version is &lt;700g so easy to grab on my way out if I know I'm carrying only a few things/picking up a few small items whilst out. Compared to the other bags I've been looking or own (AER, Alpha One Niner, Goruck) it's about half the weight!\n\nI did try it as my work bag, but whilst it holds my work 15.6\" laptop and other EDC, it's a squeeze to get anything else in there. I did use the organisation in the front compartment, but found I prefer using a pouch and not having to remember which dedicated slot I put something in (when I emptied it out after deciding to stop using it as my work bag, I even forgot that my glasses were in another pocket for about 3 days - admittedly I don't wear them much!). The only other minor annoyances are the water bottle pockets not having any sort of elasticity and being a tad short if using a taller flask. For my Klean Kanteen TKWide flask's in 12oz and 16oz they're fine though.\n\nI'm getting over back pain too so have found I'm pretty sensitive to bags that don't fit well, but even though I'm 6'1\" this wears very well, and being small it's not easy to overfill it, so I'm not tempted to carry too much weight with it at least.\n\nIt's not a bag I expect to last forever but for what I paid it's decent enough value. Not sure I'd pay full price though but it can be found at a slight discount usually here (in the UK).",

They have a few different styles and one has loops on both ends that can be wrapped around the straps. They work while using the bag, but slide down the strap easily. I just keep them in one of the front pockets for when I need them. \n\n\nGood review!!",

            "body": "  \\-Fjallraven Raven (20L) Backpack with standard contents.\n\nFive years ago, I was a world-traveling, hiking enthusiast who also did a lot of driving for work, and I learned to keep my essentials in a backpack at all times. I would sometimes go in to work with no plans, and by the time I was ready to leave for the day, have an out-town multiple day trip to hike or hit museums that I would head straight into from the office. I would plan a multiple-week trip out of country and carry nothing but my backpack.\n\nThose days are behind me now; I typically stay in the office for work, and with very young children, we are taking a pause from too much travel. So, as a result, I have been trying to downsize my backpack a bit and get something smaller. I tried sling bags, totes, and messenger style bags, but I cannot get around just wanting a good ole-fashioned backpack. I struggled to find one that checked all my boxes, but then on a trip to Asheville, I popped into the Fjallraven outlet and picked up what I am pretty sure is my forever bag for about $100. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5, the ONLY negative thing I can say about it is that I do not like how loose the tablet sleeve in the main compartment is. If it did not have a tablet sleeve at all, it would literally be perfect as I only carry a tiny Kindle Paperwhite which easily fits into one of the organizational zipper pouches.\n\nTo my surprise, the bottle holders can accommodate my 36oz Yeti ramblers (barely, very tight fit), and along with the standard contents pictured here, I can get 4 skivvy rolls (underwear, t-shirt, pair of socks), a pair of pants (or 2 shorts), and a light jacket without it being overfull!\n\nI absolutely love this thing and thought I would share it with some other folks who might appreciate it since my wife is tired of hearing about it! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a smaller backpack that is not so small that it gets called a man-purse (even though let’s be real, that is what it is).",

            "body": "  \\-Fjallraven Raven (20L) Backpack with standard contents.\n\nFive years ago, I was a world-traveling, hiking enthusiast who also did a lot of driving for work, and I learned to keep my essentials in a backpack at all times. I would sometimes go in to work with no plans, and by the time I was ready to leave for the day, have an out-town multiple day trip to hike or hit museums that I would head straight into from the office. I would plan a multiple-week trip out of country and carry nothing but my backpack.\n\nThose days are behind me now; I typically stay in the office for work, and with very young children, we are taking a pause from too much travel. So, as a result, I have been trying to downsize my backpack a bit and get something smaller. I tried sling bags, totes, and messenger style bags, but I cannot get around just wanting a good ole-fashioned backpack. I struggled to find one that checked all my boxes, but then on a trip to Asheville, I popped into the Fjallraven outlet and picked up what I am pretty sure is my forever bag for about $100. I would give it a 4.5 out of 5, the ONLY negative thing I can say about it is that I do not like how loose the tablet sleeve in the main compartment is. If it did not have a tablet sleeve at all, it would literally be perfect as I only carry a tiny Kindle Paperwhite which easily fits into one of the organizational zipper pouches.\n\nTo my surprise, the bottle holders can accommodate my 36oz Yeti ramblers (barely, very tight fit), and along with the standard contents pictured here, I can get 4 skivvy rolls (underwear, t-shirt, pair of socks), a pair of pants (or 2 shorts), and a light jacket without it being overfull!\n\nI absolutely love this thing and thought I would share it with some other folks who might appreciate it since my wife is tired of hearing about it! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a smaller backpack that is not so small that it gets called a man-purse (even though let’s be real, that is what it is).",

I carry a 14 inch laptop (without charger) and a lunch.\n\n1. **Raven 20 in khaki dust**: first of all how beautiful is this color? I like that it’s the most affordable option and that it’s a smaller bag. The interior organization is nice, but it makes it less versatile than the other two if I want to use it for other purposes because you end up loosing in storage capacity. I heard mixed review about the straps searching on this sub.\n\n2. **Foldsack no 1 in dust**: looks wise it’s by far my favourite. I love the snap at the top of the bag when you need to carry less it keeps it nice and flat. \n\n3. **Kanken no 2 laptop in port** I like the separate laptop compartments. I’m worried it will fit well once I have a thick winter coat on. I am also considering the mini for a purse alternative so I’m not sure I should go with that one for that reason as well.",

Their CPL line was voted best EDC bag by Carryology. I just got their CHZ 26 and am loving it (paired with their CAP1). I used their MPL v2 for about a year liked that bag a lot too. Water bottle pockets are awesome on CHZ and MPL bags. Their CPL bags don’t have water bottles unfortunately. If you like the simplicity of their CHZ line, as long as both of your laptops aren’t thick, CHZ laptop pocket could work for you. I can carry a 14 inch IBM Thinkpad, 13 inch MacBook Pro and iPad mini in CHZ 26 laptop compartment, snug, but it fits. You could also get a vertical laptop sleeve if you don’t want to put everything in the laptop pocket. CPL and CHZ will fit under airplane seat as personal item.\n\n*Edit*\nThings I love about Evergoods bags:\n- Attention to detail is impeccable. They purposefully chose a fabric with an equal number of strands in both horizontal and vertical directions for equal tear strength in all directions. Most fabrics have an unequal number of strands in horizontal and vertical directions resulting in unequal tear strength in different directions. They also use high quality foam. Most foam in backpacks is generic stuff with different size bubbles. Different size bubbles distributed unevenly means there could be weak points in the foam. They use specific foam where nitrogen gas is used create equal sized bubbles distributed equally. Again, this means equal tear strength in all directions. Their backpack straps are understitched. This means the fabric on the underside of the straps is slightly shorter than the fabric on the outer side, so the straps have a natural curve to them to fit your body.\n- Thoughtful design. Their pockets have independent volume. All too often backpack makers design a bag’s pockets so only thin items fit in them. Evergoods backpack organization pockets are spacious so thick items can easily fit in them. Also, the lining in their bags is a neutral gray, so both dark and light colored items stand out easily in their bags. \n- Extremely comfortable. Their backpacks are designed to be worn high, when they’re worn this way, it’s as comfortable as a bag can be without using hip straps/belt. Heavy loads don’t feel as heavy compared to other bags.\n- Lifetime warranty",

Not only the G-1000 feels very premium but also the materials on the inner side (it's hard to explain, but it kinda feels... Oily? But in a very good way!)\n\nThe newer version also has back mesh, which is a nice upgrade to the 20l model. \nI'd say get it, if you can find it for a decent price.",

I'd suggest checking out the Fjallraven website or contacting their sales team to be sure.\n2. The side pockets fit my 18oz Yeti &amp; 20oz Klean Kanteen great. However, I can see if you're one to toss your bag around a lot where it might end up in odd positions - you'll probably have it fall from the pack. But for every day use I've yet to have it fall out going from my vehicle to work/etc. THAT being said, they're pretty awesome for other things like an extra pair of shoes or slender bluetooth speakers - Converse or Vans that can sort of flatten out fit perfect.\n3. Unfortunately I'd probably look elsewhere if that attribute was important. Ultimately whether or not it stands up may really come down to what sort of load the pack will be carrying. I believe the unbalance is due to the structured padding on the back, which actually makes it very comfortable when the pack is loaded up. It's a double-edged sword really. I tend to hang or lay my bags down on their back - so this isn't much of a concern for me. The few times I've tried to stand it up, it's fallen over.",
