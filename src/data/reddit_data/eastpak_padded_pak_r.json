            "body": "Hi, I finally managed to take photos while packing, so here comes my trip report for 2 weeks around Sweden and Finland in February. This was my third rail trip, second one with &lt;30L, but the first one in winter.\n\n**Temperatures:**\n\n- MIN -20¬∞C (*-4¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- MAX +10¬∞C (*50¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- most of the time around -10¬∞C (*14¬∞F*)\n\n**Route:**\n\n- Day trains to Berlin, night train to Stockholm, spending the day there\n- Night train going North to Lule√• (1 day/1 night there)\n- Train to Haparanda at the border, walking to Tornio in Finland to get on the night train to Helsinki\n- 4 nights/5 days in Helsinki with a day trip to Tampere\n- Night ferry to Stockholm (1 night/2 days there)\n- Day trains back to South Germany with stops in Norrk√∂ping (1 night) and Lund in Sweden and Odense in Denmark (1 night)\n\nSpending\n\n- 5 nights in hostels with shared bathrooms (4+1)\n- 3 nights in private hotel rooms (1+1+1)\n- 3 nights on trains (1+1+1)\n- 1 night on a ferry\n\n**The backpack: Eastpak Office Zippl‚ÄòR**\n\nFirst time using a backpack with a full panel opening and also a separate pocket at the front (compared to organiser compartments with flexible dividers to the main compartment).\n\nI had my eyes on the Evergoods MPH22 for a long time but the shop where I wanted to buy it only sold the fancy way more expensive Ecopak version in the end (after waiting weeks for it to be in stock).\n\nBut honestly, I am very happy with my choice. It was 55 ‚Ç¨. It has a simple layout, yet opportunities to be organised.\n\nMain compartment has a laptop sleeve (not used) and a little mesh zip pocket (used for backup money and phone). The front compartment has two zips on the model. They have a thin flexible divider inside. (I put cables, power bank and power adapter in one and pretty much all the small thing in the other.)\n\nThere‚Äòs even a bottle pocket on the outside which is rare for Eastpaks. It fit up to 1L bottles (lidl iced tea at least). I do wish there were two bottle pockets though, otherwise no complains. Very comfortable, at least with a winter jacket and no sweaty back‚Ä¶\n\nIf you‚Äòre interested: There‚Äòs a cleaner version called \"Out of Office\" with only 1 zip on the small compartment and no bottle pocket. And another version just like that but with an external laptop compartment called \"Back To Work\".\n\n**Packing list:**\n\nSee photos, text version with links: [lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/zi68ej)\n\nEdit: photos with black/white text colour instead of red uploaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1auupol) (sorry, colour blind people)\n\n**Things I didn‚Äôt use/barely used:**\n\n- Swimming shorts: I could have sworn one of the hotels had a pool, but they didn‚Äôt. Will *really* check next time. I also took it because I was unsure of sauna etiquette but I ended up not using it.\n- Space blanket: When checking temperatures shortly before leaving, they were lower than expected and I got a bit worried. Especially about that one day where I walked across the border with no hotel to go in between and the train leaving after 10pm at a lonely station consisting of 1 platform with half a bench and no building. Glad I didn‚Äôt need it but don‚Äôt regret packing it, kinda like first aid things.\n- Tiny microfiber towel: towels were provided everywhere I needed them\n- Backup phone: mine wasn‚Äôt stolen, so that‚Äôs great. Still good as a backup because I use my phone for my rail pass, payments and booking accommodations.\n- Barely used the small bag (first time bringing it) but that was because of spontaneous replanning and in the end, only staying at the Helsinki accommodation for several nights. It was nice on the days I used it though. Will take again when spending several days at the same accommodation. It fits a bottle, a small snack, power bank and cable. I packed it in the backpack when not in use.\n\n**Explanations for odd things:**\n\n- Yes, I took 2 beanies, but it was worth it. The thick one was still warm enough at -20¬∞C. It was quite warm around 0¬∞C though. So I packed a thin one (very light) as well. My everyday beanie is something in between but heavier.\n- Those sea to summit wipes are awesome for night trains. You feel very fresh without a shower (not always available) and skin isn‚Äôt sticky or dry.\n- Electrical tape and tools have been useful in hostels and night trains. For example, for LEDs brighter than the sun shining directly in your face or loose, rattling cabinet doors‚Ä¶",

This was my third rail trip, second one with &lt;30L, but the first one in winter.\n\n**Temperatures:**\n\n- MIN -20¬∞C (*-4¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- MAX +10¬∞C (*50¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- most of the time around -10¬∞C (*14¬∞F*)\n\n**Route:**\n\n- Day trains to Berlin, night train to Stockholm, spending the day there\n- Night train going North to Lule√• (1 day/1 night there)\n- Train to Haparanda at the border, walking to Tornio in Finland to get on the night train to Helsinki\n- 4 nights/5 days in Helsinki with a day trip to Tampere\n- Night ferry to Stockholm (1 night/2 days there)\n- Day trains back to South Germany with stops in Norrk√∂ping (1 night) and Lund in Sweden and Odense in Denmark (1 night)\n\nSpending\n\n- 5 nights in hostels with shared bathrooms (4+1)\n- 3 nights in private hotel rooms (1+1+1)\n- 3 nights on trains (1+1+1)\n- 1 night on a ferry\n\n**The backpack: Eastpak Office Zippl‚ÄòR**\n\nFirst time using a backpack with a full panel opening and also a separate pocket at the front (compared to organiser compartments with flexible dividers to the main compartment).\n\nI had my eyes on the Evergoods MPH22 for a long time but the shop where I wanted to buy it only sold the fancy way more expensive Ecopak version in the end (after waiting weeks for it to be in stock).\n\nBut honestly, I am very happy with my choice. It was 55 ‚Ç¨. It has a simple layout, yet opportunities to be organised.\n\nMain compartment has a laptop sleeve (not used) and a little mesh zip pocket (used for backup money and phone). The front compartment has two zips on the model. They have a thin flexible divider inside. (I put cables, power bank and power adapter in one and pretty much all the small thing in the other.)\n\nThere‚Äòs even a bottle pocket on the outside which is rare for Eastpaks. It fit up to 1L bottles (lidl iced tea at least). I do wish there were two bottle pockets though, otherwise no complains. Very comfortable, at least with a winter jacket and no sweaty back‚Ä¶\n\nIf you‚Äòre interested: There‚Äòs a cleaner version called \"Out of Office\" with only 1 zip on the small compartment and no bottle pocket. And another version just like that but with an external laptop compartment called \"Back To Work\".\n\n**Packing list:**\n\nSee photos, text version with links: [lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/zi68ej)\n\nEdit: photos with black/white text colour instead of red uploaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1auupol) (sorry, colour blind people)\n\n**Things I didn‚Äôt use/barely used:**\n\n- Swimming shorts: I could have sworn one of the hotels had a pool, but they didn‚Äôt. Will *really* check next time. I also took it because I was unsure of sauna etiquette but I ended up not using it.\n- Space blanket: When checking temperatures shortly before leaving, they were lower than expected and I got a bit worried. Especially about that one day where I walked across the border with no hotel to go in between and the train leaving after 10pm at a lonely station consisting of 1 platform with half a bench and no building. Glad I didn‚Äôt need it but don‚Äôt regret packing it, kinda like first aid things.\n- Tiny microfiber towel: towels were provided everywhere I needed them\n- Backup phone: mine wasn‚Äôt stolen, so that‚Äôs great. Still good as a backup because I use my phone for my rail pass, payments and booking accommodations.\n- Barely used the small bag (first time bringing it) but that was because of spontaneous replanning and in the end, only staying at the Helsinki accommodation for several nights. It was nice on the days I used it though. Will take again when spending several days at the same accommodation. It fits a bottle, a small snack, power bank and cable. I packed it in the backpack when not in use.\n\n**Explanations for odd things:**\n\n- Yes, I took 2 beanies, but it was worth it. The thick one was still warm enough at -20¬∞C. It was quite warm around 0¬∞C though. So I packed a thin one (very light) as well. My everyday beanie is something in between but heavier.\n- Those sea to summit wipes are awesome for night trains. You feel very fresh without a shower (not always available) and skin isn‚Äôt sticky or dry.\n- Electrical tape and tools have been useful in hostels and night trains. For example, for LEDs brighter than the sun shining directly in your face or loose, rattling cabinet doors‚Ä¶",

            "body": "Hi, I finally managed to take photos while packing, so here comes my trip report for 2 weeks around Sweden and Finland in February. This was my third rail trip, second one with &lt;30L, but the first one in winter.\n\n**Temperatures:**\n\n- MIN -20¬∞C (*-4¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- MAX +10¬∞C (*50¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- most of the time around -10¬∞C (*14¬∞F*)\n\n**Route:**\n\n- Day trains to Berlin, night train to Stockholm, spending the day there\n- Night train going North to Lule√• (1 day/1 night there)\n- Train to Haparanda at the border, walking to Tornio in Finland to get on the night train to Helsinki\n- 4 nights/5 days in Helsinki with a day trip to Tampere\n- Night ferry to Stockholm (1 night/2 days there)\n- Day trains back to South Germany with stops in Norrk√∂ping (1 night) and Lund in Sweden and Odense in Denmark (1 night)\n\nSpending\n\n- 5 nights in hostels with shared bathrooms (4+1)\n- 3 nights in private hotel rooms (1+1+1)\n- 3 nights on trains (1+1+1)\n- 1 night on a ferry\n\n**The backpack: Eastpak Office Zippl‚ÄòR**\n\nFirst time using a backpack with a full panel opening and also a separate pocket at the front (compared to organiser compartments with flexible dividers to the main compartment).\n\nI had my eyes on the Evergoods MPH22 for a long time but the shop where I wanted to buy it only sold the fancy way more expensive Ecopak version in the end (after waiting weeks for it to be in stock).\n\nBut honestly, I am very happy with my choice. It was 55 ‚Ç¨. It has a simple layout, yet opportunities to be organised.\n\nMain compartment has a laptop sleeve (not used) and a little mesh zip pocket (used for backup money and phone). The front compartment has two zips on the model. They have a thin flexible divider inside. (I put cables, power bank and power adapter in one and pretty much all the small thing in the other.)\n\nThere‚Äòs even a bottle pocket on the outside which is rare for Eastpaks. It fit up to 1L bottles (lidl iced tea at least). I do wish there were two bottle pockets though, otherwise no complains. Very comfortable, at least with a winter jacket and no sweaty back‚Ä¶\n\nIf you‚Äòre interested: There‚Äòs a cleaner version called \"Out of Office\" with only 1 zip on the small compartment and no bottle pocket. And another version just like that but with an external laptop compartment called \"Back To Work\".\n\n**Packing list:**\n\nSee photos, text version with links: [lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/zi68ej)\n\nEdit: photos with black/white text colour instead of red uploaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1auupol) (sorry, colour blind people)\n\n**Things I didn‚Äôt use/barely used:**\n\n- Swimming shorts: I could have sworn one of the hotels had a pool, but they didn‚Äôt. Will *really* check next time. I also took it because I was unsure of sauna etiquette but I ended up not using it.\n- Space blanket: When checking temperatures shortly before leaving, they were lower than expected and I got a bit worried. Especially about that one day where I walked across the border with no hotel to go in between and the train leaving after 10pm at a lonely station consisting of 1 platform with half a bench and no building. Glad I didn‚Äôt need it but don‚Äôt regret packing it, kinda like first aid things.\n- Tiny microfiber towel: towels were provided everywhere I needed them\n- Backup phone: mine wasn‚Äôt stolen, so that‚Äôs great. Still good as a backup because I use my phone for my rail pass, payments and booking accommodations.\n- Barely used the small bag (first time bringing it) but that was because of spontaneous replanning and in the end, only staying at the Helsinki accommodation for several nights. It was nice on the days I used it though. Will take again when spending several days at the same accommodation. It fits a bottle, a small snack, power bank and cable. I packed it in the backpack when not in use.\n\n**Explanations for odd things:**\n\n- Yes, I took 2 beanies, but it was worth it. The thick one was still warm enough at -20¬∞C. It was quite warm around 0¬∞C though. So I packed a thin one (very light) as well. My everyday beanie is something in between but heavier.\n- Those sea to summit wipes are awesome for night trains. You feel very fresh without a shower (not always available) and skin isn‚Äôt sticky or dry.\n- Electrical tape and tools have been useful in hostels and night trains. For example, for LEDs brighter than the sun shining directly in your face or loose, rattling cabinet doors‚Ä¶",

This was my third rail trip, second one with &lt;30L, but the first one in winter.\n\n**Temperatures:**\n\n- MIN -20¬∞C (*-4¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- MAX +10¬∞C (*50¬∞F*) on 2 days\n- most of the time around -10¬∞C (*14¬∞F*)\n\n**Route:**\n\n- Day trains to Berlin, night train to Stockholm, spending the day there\n- Night train going North to Lule√• (1 day/1 night there)\n- Train to Haparanda at the border, walking to Tornio in Finland to get on the night train to Helsinki\n- 4 nights/5 days in Helsinki with a day trip to Tampere\n- Night ferry to Stockholm (1 night/2 days there)\n- Day trains back to South Germany with stops in Norrk√∂ping (1 night) and Lund in Sweden and Odense in Denmark (1 night)\n\nSpending\n\n- 5 nights in hostels with shared bathrooms (4+1)\n- 3 nights in private hotel rooms (1+1+1)\n- 3 nights on trains (1+1+1)\n- 1 night on a ferry\n\n**The backpack: Eastpak Office Zippl‚ÄòR**\n\nFirst time using a backpack with a full panel opening and also a separate pocket at the front (compared to organiser compartments with flexible dividers to the main compartment).\n\nI had my eyes on the Evergoods MPH22 for a long time but the shop where I wanted to buy it only sold the fancy way more expensive Ecopak version in the end (after waiting weeks for it to be in stock).\n\nBut honestly, I am very happy with my choice. It was 55 ‚Ç¨. It has a simple layout, yet opportunities to be organised.\n\nMain compartment has a laptop sleeve (not used) and a little mesh zip pocket (used for backup money and phone). The front compartment has two zips on the model. They have a thin flexible divider inside. (I put cables, power bank and power adapter in one and pretty much all the small thing in the other.)\n\nThere‚Äòs even a bottle pocket on the outside which is rare for Eastpaks. It fit up to 1L bottles (lidl iced tea at least). I do wish there were two bottle pockets though, otherwise no complains. Very comfortable, at least with a winter jacket and no sweaty back‚Ä¶\n\nIf you‚Äòre interested: There‚Äòs a cleaner version called \"Out of Office\" with only 1 zip on the small compartment and no bottle pocket. And another version just like that but with an external laptop compartment called \"Back To Work\".\n\n**Packing list:**\n\nSee photos, text version with links: [lighterpack](https://lighterpack.com/r/zi68ej)\n\nEdit: photos with black/white text colour instead of red uploaded [here](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1auupol) (sorry, colour blind people)\n\n**Things I didn‚Äôt use/barely used:**\n\n- Swimming shorts: I could have sworn one of the hotels had a pool, but they didn‚Äôt. Will *really* check next time. I also took it because I was unsure of sauna etiquette but I ended up not using it.\n- Space blanket: When checking temperatures shortly before leaving, they were lower than expected and I got a bit worried. Especially about that one day where I walked across the border with no hotel to go in between and the train leaving after 10pm at a lonely station consisting of 1 platform with half a bench and no building. Glad I didn‚Äôt need it but don‚Äôt regret packing it, kinda like first aid things.\n- Tiny microfiber towel: towels were provided everywhere I needed them\n- Backup phone: mine wasn‚Äôt stolen, so that‚Äôs great. Still good as a backup because I use my phone for my rail pass, payments and booking accommodations.\n- Barely used the small bag (first time bringing it) but that was because of spontaneous replanning and in the end, only staying at the Helsinki accommodation for several nights. It was nice on the days I used it though. Will take again when spending several days at the same accommodation. It fits a bottle, a small snack, power bank and cable. I packed it in the backpack when not in use.\n\n**Explanations for odd things:**\n\n- Yes, I took 2 beanies, but it was worth it. The thick one was still warm enough at -20¬∞C. It was quite warm around 0¬∞C though. So I packed a thin one (very light) as well. My everyday beanie is something in between but heavier.\n- Those sea to summit wipes are awesome for night trains. You feel very fresh without a shower (not always available) and skin isn‚Äôt sticky or dry.\n- Electrical tape and tools have been useful in hostels and night trains. For example, for LEDs brighter than the sun shining directly in your face or loose, rattling cabinet doors‚Ä¶",

And while those other bags are nice too, I find the waxed heavy duty canvas a bit too rugged and outdoorsy, while the simple eastpak canvas is more neutral. \n\nAppreciate the reply though!",

Black is the color that fades the worst on duck in my opinon but this jacket doesn't have any fade yet. Not even the chalky white lines you usually get.

        "selftext": "I've been living with this backpack for about 2 weeks now and its been great! The backpack is large enough for all my stuff. In the first pocket I can keep my 13\" macbook pro inside (it can fit upto a 16\") and a couple books and theres more space. In the second pocket there are 3 small storage pockets and one mesh zipper pocket that are a good size for the stuff you don't want to throw to the bottom of the bag. The bag is also a great bag to put enough clothes for a 1 night stay somewhere, the bottom of the bag is also much more spacious than you think. There is also a bottle holder on the left side of the backpack if its on your back, and theres a little \"secret\" pocket that sits on your back, its not that spacious but can fit the important things you don't want to get stolen like your wallet passport or phone. The backpack itself is a little heavy at 850g and add to that your laptop books chargers water etc it gets heavier, but the straps are very comfortable and you have a buckle on the straps to make the backpack feel lighter. On the straps you also have a spot to hook a carabiner for if you ever decide to go on an adventure. The big velcro straps on the front side of the backpack are nice to have, I don't really have a use for them but can be useful in some cases if you ever need to carry something large, on the pictures you can see a skateboard on it, so you can get creative here. Overall a great backpack for anyone who wants a practical backpack that has enough space for a 1 night stay or a adventure and yet still have your books and laptop.",

My tried and true, trusty, right size, one bag until it gives up the ghost. But, considering it‚Äôs about 15 years old and shows hardly any wear, it may never happen. \n\nThis is the original, 1st gen Patagonia MLC. I bought it in my early 30s and I‚Äôm 48 now. It somehow always has a little extra room for something I need. It‚Äôs currently holding clothes for just under two weeks in three cities with big temperature swings, hugely different activities and a reunion. I‚Äôm pretty sure I overpacked. There‚Äôs still room for things I buy. No packing cubes, no compression bags, just my bag. \n\nIt‚Äôs gone with me overseas. It‚Äôs gone with me on work trips. It‚Äôs a road trip champion.  I‚Äôve napped on it. I have sprinted through airports with it on my back.\n\nI love seeing all of the bags people have and what‚Äôs out there, but this is my bag.\n\nWhat‚Äôs yours?",
