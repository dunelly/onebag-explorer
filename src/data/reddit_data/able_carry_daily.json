            "body": "This is the Able Carry Daily, not Daily Plus. I actually chose this over the Plus because I wanted the front pocket to be free of organization.\n\n  \nStuff I like:\n\n\\- The shoulder straps and back panel are GREAT. This pack can load up heavy and shines best when you put that back panel to use. Unlike the CPL24 where the back panel really feels like a wall pressed up against your back, this back panel pushes the load a little bit away from your back for ventilation.\n\n\\- Very comfortable as a heavy pack. Weight is about 1.3kg empty. Heavy but in comparison to CPL24, DSPTCH daypack or CT15 etc, it's all around the same. \n\n\\- Has some form and structure even when empty, so it doesn't look floppy when not packed fully. \n\n\\- As an EDC bag, the 21L packs nice and compact. Some work days I don't carry a laptop. Just some clothes and a pouch or two. I can still use this bag and it doesn't look like I'm going for a camping trip. There is still about 8L of volume left that I can use just for clothes if I need to.\n\n\\- That front pocket without organization is GREAT for clothes. I can pack all my work gear in the main pocket, and put all the gym gear in the front. \n\n\\- Clean design, not too many attachment points which I'm ok with. \n\n  \nStuff I don't like:\n\n\\- internal organization pockets in the main pocket aren't my favorite. It's flush a little lower towards the middle of the pack rather than near the top. If the pack is completely full, I can't access this pocket easily. The little sunglasses pocket is also too small for anything other than sunblock. The liner is for the pockets is also thin, and will likely be the first thing to tear over time. Much prefer CPL24's internal organizer pocket for this. One simple zippered pocket with a thicker liner would future proof it from tearing.\n\n\\- The quick access pocket has stitching that isn't the tightest. I can foresee it tearing over time. (Picture above)\n\n  \nOverall, I quite like the bag, and it actually comes in at a more useful volume that the CPL24 which I used to use whenever I'm packing a little more. The harness and straps really are comfortable, and the firmness works well for heavy loads. Just for the harness alone, I prefer it over most EDC backpacks I own.",

            "body": "This is the Able Carry Daily, not Daily Plus. I actually chose this over the Plus because I wanted the front pocket to be free of organization.\n\n  \nStuff I like:\n\n\\- The shoulder straps and back panel are GREAT. This pack can load up heavy and shines best when you put that back panel to use. Unlike the CPL24 where the back panel really feels like a wall pressed up against your back, this back panel pushes the load a little bit away from your back for ventilation.\n\n\\- Very comfortable as a heavy pack. Weight is about 1.3kg empty. Heavy but in comparison to CPL24, DSPTCH daypack or CT15 etc, it's all around the same. \n\n\\- Has some form and structure even when empty, so it doesn't look floppy when not packed fully. \n\n\\- As an EDC bag, the 21L packs nice and compact. Some work days I don't carry a laptop. Just some clothes and a pouch or two. I can still use this bag and it doesn't look like I'm going for a camping trip. There is still about 8L of volume left that I can use just for clothes if I need to.\n\n\\- That front pocket without organization is GREAT for clothes. I can pack all my work gear in the main pocket, and put all the gym gear in the front. \n\n\\- Clean design, not too many attachment points which I'm ok with. \n\n  \nStuff I don't like:\n\n\\- internal organization pockets in the main pocket aren't my favorite. It's flush a little lower towards the middle of the pack rather than near the top. If the pack is completely full, I can't access this pocket easily. The little sunglasses pocket is also too small for anything other than sunblock. The liner is for the pockets is also thin, and will likely be the first thing to tear over time. Much prefer CPL24's internal organizer pocket for this. One simple zippered pocket with a thicker liner would future proof it from tearing.\n\n\\- The quick access pocket has stitching that isn't the tightest. I can foresee it tearing over time. (Picture above)\n\n  \nOverall, I quite like the bag, and it actually comes in at a more useful volume that the CPL24 which I used to use whenever I'm packing a little more. The harness and straps really are comfortable, and the firmness works well for heavy loads. Just for the harness alone, I prefer it over most EDC backpacks I own.",

I use it for my daily commute to work (by bus) and for short trips around Europe. 21L is not much space, but its possible. Because it isn’t that big, i can take it as a carry on even with RyanAir/Wizz. I just came back from a 8 day trip to Athens (Greece). I bring cloths for 4 Days (with washing), Toiletries, Laptop, Headeat, Chargers, Glasses, umbrella and a few smaller edc items and i still had space for a couple of beers or a snack left. \n\nThe Plus has a dedicated Pocket for a Waterbottle. Since i usually don’t take a bottle with me, i use this Pocket for a small Umbrella and my Glasses. They fit perfect above each other. And if I ever take a bottle with me, I'll put it in the main compartment. Works good for me. \n\nBut my favorite thing is the front quick access compartment! I love to swing the bag around an grab my wallet (bus ticket) or my topo edc pouch. That was the reason why i like to use Messanger-Bags in the past. Im happy that i can now make a similar movment with this Backpack. Because i put the bag on the floor between my feed (in the bus) i use the hidden top pocket for my phone. Usually i don’t need it in the bus because of my Watch, but when i do, its easy accessible from above. \n\nOver all i love the build quality of the bag. Thanks to the reinforcement, it stands upright most of the time (depending on how it is packed), it is very comfortable to wear (the padding is very good) and the straps are also very comfortable. For Reverence: in 6.1 and 97kg.\n\nThe only small downside for me is the „paper-like“ Xpac Material, especially at the front. That rustles a little too much for my taste (not while i‘m wearing it, only at the touch). I only know this material from AER bags and i dont no what it is but its way better on those bags. Maybe because its thicker? I dont know... But im sure the material will last! \n\nSo a 9,5/10 from me for the Able Carry Daily Plus 😎",

Im happy that i can now make a similar movment with this Backpack. Because i put the bag on the floor between my feed (in the bus) i use the hidden top pocket for my phone. Usually i don’t need it in the bus because of my Watch, but when i do, its easy accessible from above. \n\nOver all i love the build quality of the bag. Thanks to the reinforcement, it stands upright most of the time (depending on how it is packed), it is very comfortable to wear (the padding is very good) and the straps are also very comfortable. For Reverence: in 6.1 and 97kg.\n\nThe only small downside for me is the „paper-like“ Xpac Material, especially at the front. That rustles a little too much for my taste (not while i‘m wearing it, only at the touch). I only know this material from AER bags and i dont no what it is but its way better on those bags. Maybe because its thicker? I dont know... But im sure the material will last! \n\nSo a 9,5/10 from me for the Able Carry Daily Plus 😎",

        "selftext": "A month ago after long considerations I pulled a trigger on Able Carry Daily Plus as a new EDC/short travel bag.  Really liked its design and appreciated simpler yet more thoughful internal organisation over Black Ember Shadow I also considered. \n\nThe backpack didn’t see much action - just one trip by plane and several casual walks around town. Didn’t beat or abuse it either. That said, the front panel got riddled with creases almost from the start. And while I read about this happening I didn’t expect it to be so distrubing visually.\n\nTo add to it - when handled, the bag’s fabric tends to fold by grid lines and that additionally contributes to the ‘crumpled’ look under certain light conditions. The Xpac grid seems to be more ‘protruded’ in these places as well.\n\nThis is my first Xpac bag though and I can’t really say if this is a norm for this fabric or I just make those issues up after using exclusively Cordura equipment in the past. All the photos of other Xpac bags I found on the net don’t seem to show the same sympthoms, but those pics might have been taken under different lighting conditions that simply hide majority of those creases.\n\nI would appreciate if my fellow manybaggers with more firsthand experience with Xpac stuff could take a look at some photos I made and enlighten me if this is a normal ‘patina’ or not. Im quite torn apart between wishing to run for a new Citadel R3 or just getting used to what I see on my Daily Plus.",

Vast majority of them show even and flat front panel fabric that naturally folds to form the backpack’s distinct shape (just like Cordura), whereas mine looks like piece of crumpled paper covered in creases and straight line folds all across the bag. I’ve heard it could be delamination or just a bad batch of fabric, but it seems to be okay…\n\n It’s just a striking difference between photos you see in reviews and real life.",

Probably due to the mcb's vx50 cordura / xpac blend. Yet, despite the Daily's stated 2.1lbs at empty, it feels much lighter and is the lightest feeling bag i own.\n\nLoad out:\n\n* matador nano towel\n* nano bag packable shopping bag\n* aer slim pouch: assorted tech\n* aer split kit: assorted biz cards, desk drawer stuff, pens, etc.\n* camelbak chute mag 750 ml\n* baron fig vanguard flagship notebook\n* 14\" thinkpad\n* alpaka zip pouch pro: wallet, work phone, smaller notebook, pens\n* alpaka hub pouch in vx51: edc mini tools pouch\n\nSometimes, I'll consolidate the slim pouch and split kit into my evergoods cap2l.\n\nI tend to rotate this bag for daily EDC carries for rainy weather and it handles it like a champ. but with warmer weather heading this way, it'll see way more use, as the back panel is terrific. Has always done a wonderful job of wicking sweat from my back, and on a bike ride, thanks to the raised back area, i can feel some needed airflow.\n\nThe aquaguard zips never felt like they needed breaking in, and still look fantastic after several months of use. And NEVER EVER has any moisture seeped into this bag, even after a few bike rides and long walks to the train in some bad weather.\n\nAdmittedly, its 20L does feel quite tight vs my roomier feeling Evergoods PLC20. But it also makes the carry feel nimble and close to my body. Never do i get that jangly, \"something feels loose in my bag\" feel.\n\nOf course, that's helped by their A-frame design, which does an amazing job of making it all feel super locked in. Again, i feel like a broken record, but the A-frame is one of THE BEST carry harnesses around.\n\nWhereas my beloved evergoods cpl24 implements its upper yoke to better support the pack, the A-Frame seems to work from the opposite / bottom up, cradling the bottom of the pack, almost like a table. Even when empty as seen in the last pic, i can kinda stand it up somewhat on its own.\n\nMy one gripe with the bag was the big front dump pocket that made everything slump to the bottom. But that issue was recently solved when I figured out my Evergoods CPL24 v1's similar problem with an [Alpaka zip pouch max](https://alpakagear.com/collections/all-accessories/products/zip-pouch-max-black?variant=41342430118050): This bag completely transformed! Highly recommended for this bag, or any bag that has a wide open empty front pocket.\n\nWhile the Daily Plus is still on my radar (MCB please!), this Daily is still pretty dam good.",

            "body": "With the release of the newer Daily Plus, kinda took stock of my beloved regular Daily pack, and realized, this thing still indeed rocks.\n\nI originally had a super sweet black multicam, but that bag oddly felt much heavier than this vx21 I got used. Probably due to the mcb's vx50 cordura / xpac blend. Yet, despite the Daily's stated 2.1lbs at empty, it feels much lighter and is the lightest feeling bag i own.\n\nLoad out:\n\n* matador nano towel\n* nano bag packable shopping bag\n* aer slim pouch: assorted tech\n* aer split kit: assorted biz cards, desk drawer stuff, pens, etc.\n* camelbak chute mag 750 ml\n* baron fig vanguard flagship notebook\n* 14\" thinkpad\n* alpaka zip pouch pro: wallet, work phone, smaller notebook, pens\n* alpaka hub pouch in vx51: edc mini tools pouch\n\nSometimes, I'll consolidate the slim pouch and split kit into my evergoods cap2l.\n\nI tend to rotate this bag for daily EDC carries for rainy weather and it handles it like a champ. but with warmer weather heading this way, it'll see way more use, as the back panel is terrific. Has always done a wonderful job of wicking sweat from my back, and on a bike ride, thanks to the raised back area, i can feel some needed airflow.\n\nThe aquaguard zips never felt like they needed breaking in, and still look fantastic after several months of use. And NEVER EVER has any moisture seeped into this bag, even after a few bike rides and long walks to the train in some bad weather.\n\nAdmittedly, its 20L does feel quite tight vs my roomier feeling Evergoods PLC20. But it also makes the carry feel nimble and close to my body. Never do i get that jangly, \"something feels loose in my bag\" feel.\n\nOf course, that's helped by their A-frame design, which does an amazing job of making it all feel super locked in. Again, i feel like a broken record, but the A-frame is one of THE BEST carry harnesses around.\n\nWhereas my beloved evergoods cpl24 implements its upper yoke to better support the pack, the A-Frame seems to work from the opposite / bottom up, cradling the bottom of the pack, almost like a table. Even when empty as seen in the last pic, i can kinda stand it up somewhat on its own.\n\nMy one gripe with the bag was the big front dump pocket that made everything slump to the bottom. But that issue was recently solved when I figured out my Evergoods CPL24 v1's similar problem with an [Alpaka zip pouch max](https://alpakagear.com/collections/all-accessories/products/zip-pouch-max-black?variant=41342430118050): This bag completely transformed! Highly recommended for this bag, or any bag that has a wide open empty front pocket.\n\nWhile the Daily Plus is still on my radar (MCB please!), this Daily is still pretty dam good.",

            "body": "Below is the full review for the Daily from Able Carry. More pictures can be found at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/able-carry-daily-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/able-carry-daily-review)\n\n[Able Carry](https://www.ablecarry.com/?ref=alexanderdotsenko), a Hong Kong-based bag maker, has been around for just a few years but is already making good progress disrupting the carry world. Their idea was simple – make straightforward, no-fuss bags with thoughtful design and high-quality materials.\n\nThe story of the company began with the Kickstarter campaign launched in April 2018 for their first bag – the Daily. The campaign was backed by 430 people, which may not sound like a lot but for their first attempt at crowdfunding, it’s a very good start. Moreover, the goal was more than doubled with a total of over $45k raised. Not too shabby.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* PRICE: $148 (X-PAC) or $110 (Cordura)\n* DIMENSIONS: Height 48 cm x Width 28 cm x Depth 19 cm\n* WEIGHT: 0.9 kg\n* CAPACITY: 20L\n\nThe Daily is offered in 2 different options – Active and Casual. The only difference between the two is the choice of fabric. Active is made out of X-PAC (Dimension-Polyant’s signature laminated sailcloth fabric) and Casual is offered in a more common 1000d Cordura nylon fabric in a wide range of colors.\n\nI also appreciated the very subtle yet stylish branding. No flashy logos or patches, just a very tasteful black-on-black Hypalon label with a laser engraving of the brand name. And did I mention that Able Carry meticulously color-matches the zippers for each of their bags? That’s the attention to detail often missed in even premium brands. Love it.\n\nAt first glance, the bag does not look like much. But the more I used it the more I appreciated the approach Able Carry took when designing the Daily. Many bag-makers fill their bags to the brim with bells and whistles, over-engineering and just cramming as many features as they possibly can in the pursuit to appeal to a wider audience. On this quest, the essentials are often neglected for the sake of the wow factor. Able Carry went a different route. Before even considering any feature they wanted to nail the essentials – the comfort, the size, and the organization.\n\nLet’s take a closer look and see if this bag is worthy enough to be your “daily” companion.\n\n**QUALITY &amp; COMFORT**\n\nMy Daily is made from X51 X-PAC material that Able Carry calls “Deep Black”. X51 offers reassuring rigidity and structure, has a matte finish, and is very nice to the touch. Essentially the fabric has three layers, each providing specific performance properties:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* the outer layer is 500d x 1000d Cordura nylon\n* the middle layer is a laminated X-Ply polyester which reinforces the fabric by adding strength in multiple directions\n* the inner layer is a .5 mm polyester film for water resistance and added structure\n\nWhat does all of it mean in practice? The material is completely waterproof, exceptionally durable, and abrasion-resistant. The bag itself is NOT waterproof, as the water can still seep in through the seams and zippers, but overall build is very good, especially for the asking price. I did find a loose thread or two immediately after unpacking the bag but it did not ruin my experience, just a minor issue. Also, X-PAC makes the bag less “floppy”, and the fabric keeps its structure even when the bag is half empty.\n\nThe zippers are all YKK RC8 (Racquet Coil size 8) with AquaGuard tape for enhanced protection from the elements. A very nice touch is adding Hypalon zipper pulls – long enough to quickly catch the zipper and open with ease. The zipper pulls also feature a loop for your finger which makes operating the zippers a fun and effortless experience.\n\nThe plastic hardware is made of an industry-standard, Duraflex POM, and even here Able Carry did not skimp on quality.\n\nThe inner liner is a grey polyester fabric, nothing outstanding but it gets the job done. To sum up, the bag has a very solid build and the choice of materials is excellent.\n\nBut what about comfort? I was pleased to find out that it’s on par with the build.\n\nThe shoulder straps are wide and generously padded. Even fully packed I was able to comfortably carry the bag over extended periods.\n\nThe top grab handle is one of the most pleasant I had a chance to use. It reminds me of the grab handle used in Peak Design Everyday Backpack and Travel backpack – thick, smooth to the touch, and long enough for easy grabs.\n\nThe back panel features vented air mesh padding which helps with air circulation and as a result, your back stays ventilated and sweats less.\n\nThe sternum strap, even on a smaller bag, is a must for me and I was glad to find it on the Daily out of the box. I don’t use the strap for weight distribution but more as a way to fix the position of the shoulder straps. Bonus points to Able Carry for including an elastic portion of the sternum strap – it helps a lot with the comfort and does not restrict breathing. This should be a default way to make a sternum strap on any bag.\n\nAble Carry went the extra mile and added an interesting solution to reinforce the bag and help it keep its structure and distribute the weight comfortably. They called it the A-frame. Essentially it is a row of seatbelt webbing sewn at the critical points of the bag – the sides and the bottom to help retain the bag’s shape (aesthetics) and distribute the load evenly (function/comfort). On my Deep Black Daily the A-Frame blends in nicely. A bonus – the A-frame also gives a generous amount of attachment points for a carabiner, keys, Bluetooth speaker, etc.",

                "body": "**ORGANIZATION**\n\nThe organization is very well thought-through.\n\nMy typical EDC consists of:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* MacBook Pro 16\n* Org pouch with Cables/Chargers/Dongles\n* Nalgene 32 oz\n* Packable Jacket\n* Kindle Voyage\n* Face mask\n* Wallet\n* Sunglasses\n* Powerbank\n* Phone\n* Dopp kit\n\nMy typical EDC. Fits like a charm!\n\nAll of this fit in the Daily like a charm, though admittedly not leaving too much room to spare.\n\nNow to the actual organization and pocket at your disposal:\n\n**Externally**\n\n\\- Top access pocket is facing your back and is hard to reach by pickpockets. I felt confident storing my valuables such as phone, wallet, passport there. The pocket also has a nice depth to it.\n\n\\- The diagonal cut quick access pocket blends in when not in use but very easy to access and offers a surprisingly generous amount of space for anything you want easily accessible. I usually stored my thermos or water bottle here. Since there is no external water bottle pocket on the bag, storing it at the front was the most intuitive choice. A nice touch: dding a key leash in this pocket for quick access to your keys. \n\n**Internally**\n\n\\- Mesh internal pocket. Generously sized,, the mesh on it has some give and dimension to it, and I love the visibility this pocket offers. It’s perfect.\n\n\\- Front internal pocket\n\n\\- Front access pocket\n\n\\- Padded and suspended laptop sleeve. Fits my MBP16 like a charm\n\n\\- Top access pocket\n\n\\- Secret pocket\n\nFits all m EDC with room to spare. Love it!\n\nAble Carry offered everything you could need to organize your daily essentials. But if you still long for more – throwinh an org pouch inside the bag is always an option.\n\nOverall the organization strikes a delicate balance between giving you just enough to keep yourself organized and not so much pocketing as to get lost in a pocket maze.\n\nLet’s be honest, 20L is not a ton of capacity, but while using Daily it kept me focused on the essentials I need and use, instead of “what-ifs” and “nice-to-haves” I tend to throw in the larger bags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Excellent materials and build. If you like your bags more structured, especially when not full – go with X-PAC instead of Cordura (Active instead of Casual option)\n* Affordable price. There is a lot of bag and quality materials for the $148\n* Thoughtful organization\n* Solid comfort, excellent straps, wonderful sternum strap, and back panel\n* It’s perfect for the size.\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The size of the 20L feels smaller than some similar 20L packs. The Daily feels almost to be constraining you to work inside the provided dimensions, so you have to be comfortable with a smaller bag before you make a purchase. Abandon the hope of hauling groceries in this thing.\n* The shape of the bag does not allow it to stand when placed on the ground.\n\n**WRAP-UP**\n\nI have to say it was challenging to find the negatives of daily. All the pillars of the excellent bag are here (comfort, organization, build) and if you are looking for a compact, comfortable, and yet extremely well-built bag that will not break the bank – I highly recommend Daily as your trusty friend for many years to come. Just make sure to pick the right fabric :)\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nThe bag was provided as a sample for review purposes, the content of this review was not shared with Able Carry before publishing.\n\nMy goal is to share an honest, unbiased review that is not tailored to keep the brand happy.\n\nIf you would like to support my reviews please use the [affiliate link when purchasing Able Carry products](https://www.ablecarry.com/?ref=alexanderdotsenko), this adds no extra cost to you, but helps a lot.

I've been eyeing one myself so it's nice to hear another review with such great experience with the bag. \n\nI'm caught in a dilemma between the Deep Black and Navy Daily Active - I understand that the Navy uses VX21 instead of VX50/51 on the Black and was wondering if you maybe knew what the differences are between the two? \n\nI'm also curious if you've had the opportunity to take the bag for a walk while it was raining to test out the water resistance? And is the 500d Cordura surface layer a dust/dog hair magnet?",

It is a dust and lint magnet and cats hair for example “sticks” to it. \n\nVX21 has a shine to it, it’s very smooth and cleaning the bag is as easy as just sprinkling some water or using a wet cloth. It does look a bit more technical due to the sheen of the fabric and also a bit less structure/rigidity so the bag will not hold its shape as good as X51, some parts of the bag might collapse. This effect is noticeable on another Able Carry bag - Daybreaker , which has an option of grey VX21 fabric. I will post the review on it next weekend :)\n\nAs you can see both fabrics have their pros and cons so it’s important to ask yourself what you value most (structure, ease of cleaning, the look of the fabric and how it goes with your style/wardrobe)",

        "selftext": "Recently got the Able Carry Daily Plus and I’m very happy with it (after trying many different bags from Aer, Bellroy and Evergoods). \n\nProbably as close to my holly grail bag as could be. \n\nThe only thing I’m missing is a luggage passthrough that lets me stand the bag up on a rolling suitcase. Foretunately, pictured above are webbing loops on the back of it, that seem ideally placed to add one though!\n\nIf someone here could point me in the right direction for finding something like this, I would much appreciate it!\n\n*Looking for* a piece of 1” webbing with a g-hook on either end (or some other means of connecting it to the loops that wouldn’t be too much of a bother to take on/off). Length is 8-9”.\n\nIdeas where I could find something like that?",

It's the C (Daypack) length.\nAs you can see from the pics below, it fits well over both my luggage handles - and most importantly over the wider one where other of my bags did not fit over.\nI have yet to test the comfort of wearing the packed out bag with the strap attached, but mostly plan on removing it once I have arrived at destination and use the bag for a day pack. This brings me to the only downside I have already identified - the two clips at either end of the strap are a real PITA to open, and especially to then remove from the backpack once attached. I hope they break in and get easier to open with time.\nThe backpack itself seems great so far (cordura version) and the hidden pocket at the top of the back panel is perfect for stowing the DSPTCH strap when not in use.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/sunvu57",

Pictures of that bag’s cordura would be most similar. \n\nTry looking on ebay, poshmark, here in reddit, and the different people taking different photos in various lighting would give you an idea of how the cordura looks most naturally and not under consistent studio lighting.\n\nThen maybe cross reference that with the olive cordura to get a sense of how the coyote cordura would drape on the bag.",

They haven't responded just yet, so I was curious if anyone could tell what variant of X-Pac (VX21, X51, VX42) is this? Thanks for the help.\n",
