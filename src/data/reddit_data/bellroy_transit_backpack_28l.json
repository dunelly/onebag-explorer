            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous.

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice?

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "Oh man, was really excited for these but unfortunately they really missed the mark for me.  \n\nTransit Workpack V2 looked interesting with its improved back panel and straps, but the removal of the top sunglasses pouch is a major bummer ~~- apparently the website agrees with me as it’s still listed as one of the features~~. Also, many of the zipper pulls (external and internal) have been downgraded to a cheap looking nylon material - can always replace these later with something better, but you won’t have the leathery-like goodness of what came on V1’s external pulls.   \n\nThe Pro 22L… I was really hoping this would be an expanded-upon version of the Workpack, but instead it’s a shrunken version of the expanded-upon Transit Backpack. I appreciate the beefy harness system and back panel, but wish the main compartment’s organization was closer to the old Workpack with the additional sleeves for tablets or documents… not feeling the compression straps here. The new admin panel is an improvement for me as I tend to access pockets while the backpack is upright. Don’t buy/appreciate them pointing out that it’s deep enough for a tablet as that’s a great way to end up with a bent tablet if you really pack things out, but appreciate the depth nonetheless. \n\nPro 28 does seem to be a legit upgrade to the old Transit Backpack, mainly due to the improved harness system. I can see the new admin panel not vibing with everyone, but I think many will appreciate it. More torn about the changes inside the main compartment’s organization… you lose the big vertical zip pocket that shared capacity with the front panel but gain a more substantial mesh pocket with additional visibility. The new mesh doesn’t seem as stretchy and looks a bit tackier imo, but this is probably a personal preference thing weighted towards those who really like the extra visibility. The laptop compartment is more or less the same, though maybe the lining isn’t as nice? Hard to tell. \n\nWas really expecting to throw money at Bellroy with these releases as I’ve been asking for improvements like these but now I can’t help but feel like I got monkey’s paw’d.\n\n**Edit:** I went ahead and nabbed the Transit Workpack 2nd Edition. I figured maybe the aspects they removed aren't dealbreakers considering the upgraded harnass system. Here's the breakdown:\n\n\\+ Improved back panel with luggage passthrough  \n\\+ Nice feeling straps; they have a stiffness on the top, with firm cushy memory foam on the bottom  \n\\+ External water bottle pocket seems better than older zip pocket  \n\\+ Two additional slip pockets in the main compartment; one on the side, one on the inside of mesh pocket\n\n\\- Removed the top sunglasses pocket  \n\\- Removed the side quick access pocket, re-located (the now nicer) key leash to front quick access panel  \n\\- Removed the sideways slip pocket inside the front quick access panel, only pen holders remain  \n\\- Replaced two of the leather external zipper pulls with cheaper nylon pulls\n\nBellroy is advertising this by stating \"You asked for this...\" and I can't help but feel that's disingenuous. No one asked for them to remove so many features. The entire reason people felt strongly enough to even ask for these improvements is because they liked the bag as it was. I now firmly believe they cut this bag down to differentiate it from a different bag that, again, no one asked for - the 22L Pro. This whole launch really feels like a misalignment between the product, marketing, and customer feedback/service teams. Make no mistake, this isn't what we wanted, it's what Bellroy wanted.",

            "body": "So, after owning the Bellroy (but not traveling this year) the itch for a new bag got to me and I picked up the Heimplanet Transit 28L.  \n\nI liked the 34L version of this bag last year, but never pulled the trigger.  Now I wonder if I should have.  \n\nThe Bellroy has been discussed at length.  It’s a very well thought out backpack with only a few nitpicks.  The best of it for me is that even at 28L, it feels like I could use it as a one bag in a pinch.  The cavernous inside space allows great organization with packing cubes, and most of the other pockets and storage are well thought out, if extremely simple.  \n\nThe Heimplanet is a reverse clamshell.  The back opening is awesome and super well organized with the right pockets and space for laptop and tablet.  However, it sure feels small for the 28L it claims.  Part of that is the interior main space and the way it opens up. \n\nThe front pockets are well organized, but intrude in the main area space when full.  Also, you don’t have the small cellphone pocket that is at the top of the Bellroy. \n\nUltimately, I like the Heimplanet, and could use it as an EDC with limited extended travel. I can see putting my Dopp kit, one medium packing cube and my electronics in there.   I don’t think you could carry an extra set of shoes in there. Likely one change of clothes and a small pocket camera.",

I bought this bag in a slightly different shade of blue a few years ago, and they made some improvements:  straps no longer loosen on their own due to thicker webbing material used, the back panel is more comfortable (thicker padding?)\n- The interior volume is spacious even with water bottle intruding part of the space.

Some impressions:\n \nPros\n- Love that it fits my [Aer Slim pouch](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/88CQ3MRegz) within the admin shelf that’s part of the laptop compartment. It means I don’t have to open the rest of the bag most of the time. \n- I think this version is superior to second edition with two internal water bottle pockets (you don’t have to use them for water bottles) and the top sunglasses/quick-access pocket that aren’t present in V2\n- This is more of a V1.5. I bought this bag in a slightly different shade of blue a few years ago, and they made some improvements:  straps no longer loosen on their own due to thicker webbing material used, the back panel is more comfortable (thicker padding?)\n- The interior volume is spacious even with water bottle intruding part of the space.

Typically I've always had a roller that usually goes in the overhead bin along with a small backpack. But decided to remove that outright and just settle for one bag and nothing else.\n\nHence the 28 Liter Bellroy Transit bag\n\n**The Dilemma**\n\nI was debating between the 20 Liter and the 28 Liter. There's a ton of happy campers with the 20 Liter variant but admittedly they mentioned that the 20 liter wasn't a Onebag travel bag. It's more used for EDC stuff.\n\n**Gripes and Gloss**\n\nThere's things that people love about this bag. And there's things people don't like.\n\nPeople love the look of it. It really is a beautiful looking bag.\n\nPeople love the simplicity of it\n\nPeople love that it's a clamshell opening\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/05oj2v3q3r591.png?width=1782&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2093738683a890eefa2d4030a6b11693de7ecd67\n\nPeople love that it can be used as carry-on\n\nPeople love that it  can be used as a personal item if you don't stuff it\n\nPeople love that it can be used as an EDC bag somewhat if you don't stuff it\n\nPeople hate the water pouch. Problem is that the water pouch can't even fit a 20 oz Zojirushi bottle. It also eats into the space.\n\nPeople are so-so about the comfort of it.\n\nPeople don't like the consistency of it. The black version is the best made version. It's not just a color thing. The entire material is different depending on what color you choose.  If you choose a blue one, it's something else entirely and looks far cheaper. Bellroy has different material depending on which variant of the 28 liter you get. The best version is the black one. Don't get the other colors as those are made of uglier, cheaper materials.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1o8t44v14r591.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45ff65a7e316bdbdedf4c9b67cf1365f078ad94e\n\n**Ok so how much can it hold?**\n\nSo it can hold quite a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's break it down.\n\n**All of the images below are what fit inside the bag.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# FRONT POCKET\n\n[2 wet wipes, coin bag, passport, 2 pens, Logitech K380, Vapur water bottle, Field notes](https://preview.redd.it/wbkveg8hcr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43d789401993068b1f2f42fb78c558d7cf743c4d)\n\n# INSIDE THE CLAMSHELL OPENING\n\n[2 shorts, Matador towel, eye cover](https://preview.redd.it/4fpoacnncr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86fe59c9c156e717307e87eb9087d78d14f3e055)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A bunch of Anker cables, chargers, Logitech Pebble, thumb drive, battery, USB hub, tiny flashlight](https://preview.redd.it/2evp2auucr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=193768bd43c0ffedb15ae4174fb5ef7e00339ca1)\n\n[4 shirts, 4 underwear, 4 socks](https://preview.redd.it/1ngbcbl1dr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15649862061bc504b45cebca64f723f28f6b7bde)\n\n[OneBlade, chapstick, deodorant, contact lens, lotion, sunblock, Toothbrush, melatonin, earplugs, cologne \\(I just realized I needed to add toothpaste\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rjtmjpu1er591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a338fdd953fdd655f20db82ce13dfd2cca0d920e)\n\n[Sennheiser MKH 416, XLR cable, portable neck pillow, belt, shockmount, Tripod, Zoom F3](https://preview.redd.it/q44153badr591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bf169a1214188699a79eb28266e1af5166c6667)\n\n# BACK OPENING\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Moondrop Blessing 2, Surface Go, Macbook Pro](https://preview.redd.it/4tpllupger591.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b0268757571c3f4a7f2bf9126107a4a5f67193)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok so how bad are the flaws of this bag?**\n\nSo as mentioned there are 2 major flaws of this bag. The 1st flaw is that there's a slot in the back where you're supposed to put a water bottle. But the problem is that when you put a water bottle in there it's very difficult to take out. I consider myself fairly athletic and it wasn't easy to take out. Required a lot of force with a Zojirushi 20 oz bag.\n\n2nd major flaw is that the straps are a bit thin. They also kind of have an edge to them. So it can be uncomfortable.\n\n**Can it be fixed?**\n\nYes! In a way.\n\nHere was my workaround.\n\nI just didn't use the water pouch. Instead I just brought a Vapur Water bottle instead. The problem with using the water pouch is that when you put a water bottle inside, it eats into your space. So I solved the problem by just not getting a hard-case water bottle. That said if I really really wanted to get a water bottle like a Hydroflask to work on this, I'd either pack it inside or I'd attach it with a carabine on the outside.\n\n**But what about the straps?**\n\nI found a way to fix the problem. What you can do is buy shoulder pads on Amazon and when you attach them to the bag it becomes much much more comfortable. So I modded the Bellroy bag to be super duper comfortable by buying one of these shoulder pads. Shoulder pads like these: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHKVRX7/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BHKVRX7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yf18hwxcku591.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3518d54b89475a283d92eced3adb1dfcd85940cd\n\n**How much did it weigh in the end?**\n\nIt weighed a total of 15 pounds for everything here. So by all accounts it should be enough to pass through to any airline.\n\n**My overall thoughts**\n\nI am super stoked with this bag! I love how it looks. And as mentioned, when you add the shoulder pads, it makes it super comfortable. And I don't mind that I don't use the water pouch - because by just using a Vapur water bottle, I save so much space. So overall a really great Onebag. I'd even argue that I should and could be bringing much less. But this just goes to show how much it can hold! :D\n\nThat's all folks! :D",

Or did you mean to include the 3 liter front pocket?\n\n\nRegardless, I like the toilet paper standard as a lingua franca, although TP rolls vary a bit by country. Tennis balls would be better and ping pong balls (38mm) would approach the ASTM standard using 20mm balls. The larger the unit of measurement, the less that the small nooks and crannies can be included. You start to get into the efficiency of a particular proportion (like playing Tetris).\n\nIf you go by external measurements, the Dragonfly would fit into a 25 liter box and the Bellroy Transit would need a 36 liter box. That doesn't account for curves and taper. \n\nSeeing that you have them on hand it would be a great opportunity to check the accuracy of the published dimensions.",

Among them are:\n\n**\\[The Bags\\]**\n\n* ULA Dragonfly (X50) - $200\n* Tortuga Travel Backpack (30L) - $325\n* Patagonia MLC 30- $200\n* Tom Bihn Synik 30 (X-Pac) - $325\n* Bellroy Transit (28L) - $250\n* Goruck Long Range Rucker (33L) - $200 (discounts)\n\nMy personal goal has been to find a new “all-around” pack that fulfills my daily EDC, travel, and occasional day hike needs. Previously I’ve used an Osprey Comet (30L) and it has served me valiantly. It has a lot of features that I continue to look for in many packs and this was prior to even realizing what type of bag critic I’d become through this process. Unfortunately the Osprey is starting to lose it’s luster and some areas have failed (water resistant zipper, zipper pulls etc.).\n\nAs I’ve read through r/onebag and watched dozens, if not hundreds, of YouTube reviews I’ve purchased the bags outlined above. Honestly, I’ve been interested in a few more but….you gotta commit at some point.\n\nI won’t claim to be even a novice reviewer but I figured it would be helpful for some folks to see these bags “head-to-head” in some respects, especially in pictures, and inserting my opinion. I will also note that I did not provide pics of how it wore as it, frankly, would have taken too long and I’m not getting paid for this. Additionally, I did not take picks of the straps or back padding as that is readily available online for all packs.\n\nFor this specific pack, there are several important things to consider to ME:\n\n· Material (includes aesthetics)\n\n· Comfort (to include backstraps, weight, etc.)\n\n· Organization (pockets, storage design, functionality, etc.)\n\n· EDCability (pretty subjective, but how easy it is to pass along into EDC usage)\n\n· Value (most important…and most subjective)\n\nI’m going to rank each category on a 10-point scale out of 5 total points (i.e. 0.5 increments).\n\nSo let’s dive in. I kept the load simple, modest, and not really at all representative of the potential options for any of the packs. Each person’s usage and creativity is so unique that I felt it would be better, for my purposes (and maybe yours) to view and pack this way for comparisons sake.\n\n**\\[The Load\\]:** [https://i.imgur.com/q5tm0y3.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/q5tm0y3.jpeg) \n\n· Medium Peak Design packing cube, loaded up\n\n· Small Peak Design packing cube, loaded up\n\n· 32oz Nalgene\n\n· 15” Laptop\n\n· Laptop charger (attempted to store in brain or similar pocket)\n\n**\\[The Bags\\]:** [**https://i.imgur.com/VHTHr9J.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/VHTHr9J.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/waNEzmI.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/waNEzmI.jpeg) \n\n**I tried to picture material, load, front, and side visuals.**\n\n**ULA Dragonfly (X50):** [**https://i.imgur.com/uP2nd7p.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/uP2nd7p.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/4LtSd9n.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/4LtSd9n.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/jU9wsYm.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/jU9wsYm.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/EAWWoZv.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/EAWWoZv.jpeg) \n\n* · Material: 4.5/5.0\n   * Seemingly very durable and very well-constructed. Love the color. Subtle “x” marks which I personally love. Seams were tight. Zippers were high quality. Seems fairly waterproof.\n* Comfort: 4.5/5.0\n   *  Probably the lightest of all the bags I’ve packed. Straps and weight carries comfortably even with slightly heavier weight. Very slim profile overall and never moved around much. No hip belt provided. Packed out it was very compact and reasonable on the back and would fit under most seats.\n* Organization: 4.0/5.0\n   * Very simplistic layout but with well-thought generalized pockets. The huge side pockets are wonderful and allow an almost unmatched level of versatility. The front bungee was substantially more useful than I originally imagined. Included internal and external compression straps (could potentially float it up another 0.5 points).\n* EDCability: 4.5/5.0\n   * Due to its light weight and functional/adaptable pockets I felt I was able to carry a variety of things or loads comfortably into work or on day trips.\n* Value: 4.5/5.0\n   * At $200 it’s not “cheap” but with consideration for other packs in this category and what I, ultimately, felt this bag was worth I was very happy with the overall value between functionality, versatility, and price.\n\n**Tortuga Travel Backpack (30L):** [**https://i.imgur.com/uGVKhIg.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/uGVKhIg.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/Isj9Abg.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/Isj9Abg.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/3lB8TyS.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/3lB8TyS.jpeg) **(forgot to take loaded picture, couldn’t fit Nalgene in side pockets)**\n\n* Material: 5.0/5.0\n   * Wow. What can I say but I was extremely impressed at how impressive this looked and felt. I felt very confident in its ability to perform in the most extreme of travel environments. Seams and zippers were high quality. Seems very waterproof. Tortuga absolutely nailed their new fabric and I’d love to see it in other packs. Probably the most shocking single feature of any pack of this review process. \n* Comfort: 4.0/5.0\n   * Very well-padded straps and wears very well and high up on the body. Carries comfortable but noticeably heavier than most packs. Adjustable strap system was easy to use and very helpful during initial fitting. Hip belt provided. Packed out it was fairly reasonable on the back, may not fit under some seats.\n* Organization: 4.5/5.0\n   * Front slash pocket. Small brain pocket. Organization pocket with extra storage. Main pocket with zipper storage. Well-padded laptop compartment. -0.5 for the side bottle pockets which were VERY limiting in size, though they were slim. Otherwise this is a perfect score depending on your needs for side pockets.\n* EDCability: 4.0/5.0\n   * Has all the pockets you’d expect from an EDC pack except for potential sizing from side pockets as referenced. A little heavy and a little bit of an “awkward” carry due to load lifters and other factors for standard daily carry.\n* Value: 3.5/5.0\n   * Probably the pack I’d recommend the most for those that have the disposable income and like these specific features BUT those who don’t need a big water bottle pocket. Outside of that it’s not a great value for the money if you’re able to make the most use of open space or deal with potentially less features. \n\n**Patagonia MLC 30:** [**https://i.imgur.com/oJQRb2X.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/oJQRb2X.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/I4CW8Q2.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/I4CW8Q2.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/6w7YKCC.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/6w7YKCC.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/oOSAI8g.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/oOSAI8g.jpeg) \n\n* Material: 3.5/5.0\n   * Material is definitely quality and there is a variety from the face fabric to the joining fabric. However, it does not feel very waterproof and it was fairly loud compared to most of the other packs. It looked just fine with some reasonable color options.\n* Comfort: 3.5/5.0\n   * A lack of padding on the straps and back definitely showed through. I won’t say it was uncomfortable at all, it just felt “incomplete”. Chest strap and hip belt provided (also a shoulder strap for alternative carry mode). Packed out it was fairly reasonable on the back, may not fit under some seats.\n* Organization: 4.0/5.0\n   * Very similar in organization to the Dragonfly in that there was one main pocket, with zip enclosure and smaller pockets, and a laptop pocket. The laptop pocket had, however, substantially more organization than the comparable pack. The brain pocket was reasonably sized. The, single, side pocket was big enough for the Nalgene but was substantially tight. I missed the variety of two side pockets and felt two pockets would have been better. A front slash pocket would have been feasible and beneficial.\n* EDCability: 4.0/5.0\n   * Due to its light weight and fully functional laptop compartment it was very feasible for EDC. The lack of additional bottle pocket was limiting but overall it was perfectly reasonable from office to day or weekend trips.\n* Value: 4.5/5.0\n   * Right up there with the $200 dragonfly. If you’re looking for something that checks most of the boxes but you’re willing to compromise on a few features, this is a good option. Important to note, REI sells this pack and most have these stores available nearby (great benefits and easy returns).\n\n**Tom Bihn Synik 30 (X-Pac):** [**https://i.imgur.com/pU6vHal.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/pU6vHal.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/rgW9VSx.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/rgW9VSx.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/rViKoN1.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/rViKoN1.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/u679qOq.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/u679qOq.jpeg) **(water bottle in Tom Bihn’s middle pocket)**\n\n* Material: 4.0/5.0\n   * At this point it should be obvious I’m a fan of X-Pac and this material is no exception. TB did a great job of stitching this, new to them, high-quality fabric into their designs. It looks great with the “x” impression and is very light and attractive on the face. Definitely basic or “dad pack” aesthetic for those that care. High quality construction, though I was disappointed in the zippers.\n* Comfort: 4.0/5.0\n   * The straps are extremely well padded and have a distinct “gelled” feeling that is unique amongst the other packs I’ve tried. That said it wasn’t my favorite carry when loaded and I think that was due to the shape which was slightly different overall. Chest strap was included. Would fit under many seats but the bottle pocket is limiting.\n* Organization: 4.0/5.0\n   * I feel that TB has made a name for themselves on this pack specifically with the options for organization; this definitely didn’t disappoint. Multiple exterior pockets lends you to be creative with how you organize your life without getting into the main compartment. The laptop compartment is definitely lacking, but I’m not a fan of side access regardless. Included compression straps internally.\n* EDCability: 4.0/5.0\n   * Lighter weight and great carry lends this well to an EDC pack with a variety of pockets for some interesting storage options. However, lack of quickly accessible water bottle pocket and, frankly, annoying laptop compartment it wouldn’t be my first recommendation. \n* Value: 3.5/5.0\n   * Quite expensive for a versatile pack but their reputation precedes itself for a reason. If you’ve got the scratch and the specific pockets make you happy from an organization perspective you’ve got a great pack. Otherwise, from an all around pack it would not be my first recommendation even at a lower price point.\n\n**Bellroy Transit (28L):** [**https://i.imgur.com/tIxcKk9.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/tIxcKk9.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/BjVsQiC.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/BjVsQiC.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/e8bIyIc.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/e8bIyIc.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/r2d9Geu.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/r2d9Geu.jpeg) **(couldn’t fit nalgene in bottle pocket)**\n\n* Material: 4.0/5.0\n   * As an owner of a sling and gym bag from Bellroy I am partial to their fabrics. This is another high quality fabric and looks very attractive on, provided it’s not loaded heavily, and will blend in any environment. I do not feel confident in any waterproofing though the zippers and seams were high quality.\n* Comfort: 3.0/5.0\n   * Unfortunately, the least comfortable of the packs. Honestly not fully sure why it was so uncomfortable aside from the lower amount of padding and potentially shape of the straps. Heavier loads sat oddly and did not feel good to carry for any distance. Would fit under most seats. No hip belt was included.\n* Organization: 3.5/5.0\n   * A couple limited side pockets, top brain pocket, main pocket with internal zippers, and a laptop enclosure. Definitely more akin to an EDC than travel from the outset. The side pockets are not big enough for reasonable organization. Included compression straps internally.\n* EDCability: 4.5/5.0\n   * If you’re not needing a large and heavy water bottle and you’re trekking from home to work this is definitely one of the top recommendations. The second lightest bag with reasonable storage and reasonable carry for short distances you’re set.\n* Value: 3.5/5.0\n   * At $250 it is hard to recommend this over bags with more features and higher comfort at lower price point. However, if you’re after Bellroy’s signature materials in an attractive package for short-term carry, it’d be tough to beat.\n\n**Goruck Long Range Rucker (33L):** [**https://i.imgur.com/gjn5tWJ.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/gjn5tWJ.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/JdAURot.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/JdAURot.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/4xMhvQF.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/4xMhvQF.jpeg) **;** [**https://i.imgur.com/ZZsfZzd.jpeg**](https://i.imgur.com/ZZsfZzd.jpeg) **(no bottle pocket but was able to attach via carbiner)**\n\n* Material: 3.5/5.0\n   * In this journey I was a bit spoiled by some superior technical fabrics, that said, the 500D Cordura was quality throughout the pack. The highlight, however, was the high tenacity fabric on the straps and the back panel for comfort; very comfortable. The molle straps and other military esque features are certainly a “look” and I personally like them in most contexts. However, they can definitely be a taste and I can see this being problematic in a lot of environments.\n* Comfort: 4.0/5.0\n   * The straps are extremely thick, the thickest of any straps in this comparison. This particular version comes with a chest strap and hip belt which aids to the comfort especially when handling heavier loads or rucking. Would not fit under almost any seats.\n* Organization: 4.0/5.0\n   * Lack of specific laptop compartment is definitely the weakness here compared to the other packs on this list. Otherwise two large pockets with a variety of organizational zipper pockets is fairly. The lack of side pockets is versatility, though, molle straps adds an option for those to be added in future. \n* EDCability: 3.5/5.0\n   * It’s definitely the biggest pack on this list and carries as such. It’s very much overkill for a laptop and tech bag….but if you’re looking to ruck around with some weight to work there wouldn’t be a better option.\n* Value: 4.5/5.0\n   * Having received a discount through work I was pretty ecstatic. Knowing that it came with \\~$50 worth of accessories in the chest strap and hip belt; even more so. Additionally in my research most have found the products made in Vietnam had been better quality of which this was one of the packs. If you can snag on discount I’d recommend.\n\nUltimately, I decided to keep the **ULA Dragonfly** and the **Goruck**. I use the Dragonfly as my EDC (currently), day pack, and travel pack and Goruck for when I’m rucking around and exercising.\n\nI won’t say my journey is done. New packs are released all the time and there are still several I was interested in that I wanted to check out, namely the Able Carry Max and some Mystery Ranch varieties.\n\nI’m sure a lot of this is inconsistent, however, this took a substantial amount of my free time to type up so I hope everyone finds SOME benefit. I’ll try to answer specific questions as they come.\n\nCheers!",

They’ve been moving away from leather for a while and I don’t like their new stuff. I have the A5 leather notebook and I love that thing so much, it looks and feels great. But if you compare that with their new offering of the Tokyo Folio, which just looks clunky and cheap and poorly made. It’s not sexy, sleek, or stylish. And the prices have stayed the same or gone up for lesser quality. Also a side note, their emails used to be gorgeous. I have reached out several times to them just to applaud their designer.

For travel it’s ok but not if it’s also edc.\n\nI agree they release too many models now, but I prefer their style over Aer or Evergoods. And the quality is equal. And as a non US citizen Bellroy are more affordable.",

A 23 year old girl would likely not buy an Aer.  A 23 year old guy in their first office entry sales job out of business school probably thinks these look cool and doesn’t want to shell out for Hugo Boss.",
