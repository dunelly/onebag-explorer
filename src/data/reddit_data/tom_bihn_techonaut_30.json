I’m pretty happy about this as I didn’t want anything larger and actually am considering adding the smaller DF to the fleet as well since the 36 has more space than I need for most trips. While similar in size the DF handles capacity better than the A30. The A30 has divisions for the side pockets that can be unzipped but the extra material still interferes with packing and I never benefited from the extra separation since one side held my spiff kit already in a bag and the other footwear also in a bag. Further the two slip pockets on the A30 are nearly useless when the bag is full  unless the items stored in there were the right shape and size to not slip down to the bottom of the pocket. One of the other major reasons for moving to the DF was carry comfort I can’t confirm this yet but initial fit tests indicate much better carry comfort at least with the 20lb I am testing currently. Time will tell if the DF is more comfortable. I am a little surprised that the harness does not appear to be the same as the one in my Ohm, the straps on the DF seem slimmer and stiffer I’m hoping they turn out to feel like the backpacking hardnesses I have used from ULA as I have always found their harnesses to fit me well. From a torso length perspective the DF with the optional hip belt fits my 5’8” frame perfectly and I am able to actually use the hip belt to offload weight from the shoulders. I’d prefer sewn hip belts and I may model these in some way to make the connection to the bag more rigid but I’ll wait to see if that is necessary.

I really dislike bags with sideways pass-throughs because it’s very difficult to get items in and out of a backpack.\n* **Exterior Water Bottle Pocket**: Finally having an exterior water bottle pocket was a big draw for me.\n\n### Initial Concerns\n\n* **Size**: At 32 liters, I initially thought the bag might be too large for my needs.\n\n### Current Experience\n\nI’m currently on a business trip, and here are some thoughts after using the bag:\n\n* **Packing**: Inside, I have my Vision Pro, MacBook, all my travel accessories, and some clothing. Despite my initial concern about the size, the bag doesn’t feel too boxy when packed. It actually looks quite good when filled out.\n* **Weight**: The bag is very light, which is a big plus.\n* **Straps**: The straps are phenomenal—probably the best I’ve used, comparable only to the ones from Peak Design.\n\n### Areas for Improvement\n\n* **Pocket Depth**: I wish some of the internal pockets were a bit shallower. They all seem to be full-length except for one. However, I’ve managed by using organizers inside the bag.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, I think Tom Bihn did a really nice job with this bag. I believe it’s going to become my go-to travel bag.",

I’m sure I could get over it, but this is a major oversight for me.  \n\nSecond, the bulging front looks extremely odd.  I like the fact that I can get addition volume out of the front pocket, but again, seems like an odd design choice.  \n\nI think this will be a good bag for travel, but not fully convinced by the choices.",

I had the Synapse 25 for forever now and figured the Synik would fit exactly what I needed to one-bag. But after getting it I realized that the Techonaut 30 would probably be best. I just like the tub style of the Techonaut rather than the organized style of the Synik. Regardless, they’re all great bags but I think I’m going to get rid of the Synik 30.

        "selftext": "WARNING: Long post with lots of links to picture albums.\n\nI can't help myself.  I wish I could.  I have problems.  Thanks for putting up with me.\n\nFollowing up on my [40L-45L comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1bmzj56/40l_and_45l_packout_comparison/), then my [35L-45L comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1c15qdt/35l45l_vacation_load_out_comparision/), and my [6L-9L sling adventures](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1ac40vv/my_own_sling_adventures_6l_to_9l/), I now have my 26L-30L backpack comparisons!\n\nPart of the reason my sizing keeps going down is I'm getting better (IMHO) at minimizing and packing (thanks to experience, gear, and the r/ManyBaggers &amp; r/onebag communities).  In this pack, I've got a 3 (could easily be 5) day work trip packed:\n\n* Thule medium compression cube (also tried the Peak Design Medium cube in a couple)\n   * 1 [Lululemon ABC Warpstreme](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/mens-trousers/ABC-Pant-Classic-30/_/prod9640029?color=48432&amp;sz=40) 40x30 pant\n   * 4 Merino T-shirts (Outlier, Woolly, Merino Tech)\n   * 2 Cotton/Pique Polos\n   * 1 Bamboo pajama bottom\n   * 2 Woolly boxers\n   * 2 pairs of [Darn Tough socks](https://darntough.com/collections/men/products/mens-hiker-variety-3-pack?variant=37290122576058)\n* [CPAP](https://www.breas.us/en-US/products/sleep-therapy/z2-auto) and hoses (I really want to get [https://www.inspiresleep.com/](https://www.inspiresleep.com/) one day)\n* [Aer Split Kit](https://aersf.com/products/split-kit)\n   * 1 3-port [Anker GaN charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09W2N774C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n   * 1 USB-C [Apple (I think) charger](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ)\n   * 1 Apple [USB-C to MagSafe cable](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLYV3AM-A-USB-C-Magsafe/dp/B09JR6YFQT)\n   * 1 USB-C [multi-port (Lightning, USB-C, iWatch) cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CJ9FBTRR)\n* [Aer Travel Kit 2](https://aersf.com/products/travel-kit-2) w/Toiletries\n* 2 [Tom Bihn Ghost Whale pouches](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/accessories/products/ghost-whale-organizer-pouch?variant=42603108139197) with bars &amp; tea bags\n* [10000mAh Powerbank/charger](https://mycharge.com/products/powerhub-ultra-10k-w-built-in-usb-c-lighting-cables-and-plug)\n* 16\" MacBook Pro\n* 11\" iPad Pro\n* Apple AirPods Max headphones\n* [Sea to Summit Inflatable travel pillow](https://www.rei.com/product/150317/sea-to-summit-aeros-premium-traveller-pillow)\n* [Matador Travel eye mask](https://www.rei.com/product/233882/matador-blackout-sleep-mask-and-earplugs)\n* 32oz [Owala water bottle](https://www.rei.com/product/207323/owala-freesip-vacuum-water-bottle-32-fl-oz)\n* misc: wipes, notebook, pen, lens cleaning wipes, computer glasses\n\nMy methodology:\n\n* Use pouches to simplify moving stuff between so many bags.\n* Spending as little time as possible packing each bag.\n* Not optimizing each pack - follow a basic pattern.\n* Prefer quick access to iPad, headphones, pillow, eye mask, and a few other things when getting on the plane.  I want to get my stuff out and put the bag in the overhead bin very quickly.\n   * In an ideal world, I would have a quick-grab bag inside my bag with all my plane needs.  I used my Tom Bihn Side Hustle in some of my later tests, where I felt confident it could fit and be accessible - both removing it when boarding and reloading it quickly when deplaning.\n\nMy caveats:\n\n* I'm opinionated.  I try to share my opinions but there are times my opinion(s) show through.  If you disagree I look forward to your reviews and I will always have an open mind!\n* I'm not comprehensive (though the length of this post might make you think otherwise).  I jotted down notes as I went.  I encourage you to check out Packhacker, One Bag Travels and other reviewers for very comprehensive reviews.  I focus on how bags pack, not all the material, hardware, etc.\n* There's a lot here.  And I wrote this over many days.  So there might be disjointed thoughts and lack of continuity.\n\nFeel free to ask me questions in the comments.\n\n# [Mystery Ranch Mission Rover 30](https://www.mysteryranch.com/mission-rover-bag?quantity=1&amp;color=Black&amp;size=30L) - [https://imgur.com/a/4OoMoyM](https://imgur.com/a/4OoMoyM)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eidqtxqem23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3e476cb4b7179f4aab638c75fa00886a10cb36d\n\nI've gone through the Mission Rover in my other comparisons and it never struck a chord with me.  While I actually appreciate the suitcase-style packing, the tech area doesn't work for me.  But I like the material and the look in general.\n\nPros:\n\n* Comfortable carry.  I thought it would feel too big, but it was actually quite good.\n* Appreciate the load lifters.\n* I like the ease of removing the straps and detaching the load lifters.\n* Nice big main compartment\n* Decent secondary compartment/organization\n\nCons:\n\n* No tablet area.  I had to stack in front of my laptop, which limited how easily it could be accessed.\n* Related, the device/admin area is very small.  It's a weird shape in a weird location.  However, my niece has the Mission Rover 45 and loves the placement for the device since she uses it as onebag everywhere.  So, to each their own.\n* No water bottle pocket\n* No quick access for anything\n* Nowhere for headphones to naturally fit.  I used the bottom of the tech panel but they aren't safe in there.\n* No hip belt, even as an option.\n\n# [Bellroy Venture Ready Pack 26L](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-ready-pack?color=midnight&amp;material=baida_ripstop&amp;size=26l_previous) - [https://imgur.com/a/pMVSR5x](https://imgur.com/a/pMVSR5x)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/guikysdgm23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=054e5a0a5245b89f08249a10a7b27228038cb42b\n\nThis is the first Bellroy backpack I've tested out.  My daughter actually chose this bag from online pictures.  By the time the Bellroy arrived, she had already started using the Fjallraven Raven 28 and the Raven just worked better for her (more compartments and separation of stuff).  I'm returning the Bellroy but thought I'd put it through the paces as well.\n\nPros:\n\n* Surprised how much actually fit.  Didn't seem that big.  A lot of wide open space.\n* Front admin (brain) was impressively big.  One of the only bags where I was happy with the quick access for the plane.\n* Side pocket is spacious - I was able to fit my charging kit (Aer Split Kit) after the backpack was packed out.\n* Excellent padding and surprisingly comfortable carry.\n\nCons:\n\n* No separate access to laptop or device area.  Once it's packed, you're not getting these out.\n* Packing it up was difficult.\n* Had to start closing the zipper to be able to load it up.\n* No room for headphones &amp; water bottle (bottle pocket is too small and unusable when packed out)\n\n# [Evergoods CTB26](https://evergoods.us/products/civic-travel-bag-26l) - [https://imgur.com/a/UUG9UTj](https://imgur.com/a/UUG9UTj)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3t00zvhm23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=194624f4f922f59dc7726936780d1310bba982c8\n\nI know the CTB26 gets a lot of respect, and it's well deserved.  I used this as my EDC for a while, only to be replaced by the ULA Ultra Dragonfly (30).  I think it'll make a comeback, though.  I do appreciate the ease of  top-access and the compartments.  What I'm realizing is I like compartments with volume without forced organization (e.g. Aer).\n\nTip: Make sure you use all the compartments on the front panel.  There's a lot of volume in there that goes to waste.\n\nPros:\n\n* So much quick access.  Love the yoke, dump, and slash pockets!\n* I was able to get everything in without using the yoke pocket.  I did this intentionally as I don't want to dig through several pockets when getting on a plane.\n* Comfortable enough - definitely feel the weight, but it mostly handles the weight well.\n* Definitely handled the whole packout better than the Bellroy 26L.\n\nCons:\n\n* No load lifters or hip belt.  Take-it or leave-it comfort.  No dialing it in very much.  I think the CPL28 is more comfortable, personally.\n* Quite difficult to get everything in and zipped up.  Since i have the X-Pac (Phoenix) edition, there's no stretch or forgiveness.  I wish I had the nylon version to compare it against.\n* With the main compartment and front pockets packed out, closing the laptop compartment was pretty challenging - the zipper was definitely stressed.  [You can see the zipper looks pretty tight](https://imgur.com/S2SLljE).\n\n# [Evergoods CPL28](https://evergoods.us/collections/backpacks/products/civic-panel-loader-28l) - [https://imgur.com/a/GZEsjbA](https://imgur.com/a/GZEsjbA)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dw6qosl2np2d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe08782b3f5daec0b23f740d104dea15bbc82e53\n\nOn a recent trip, I was debating between the CPL28 and the CTB35.  I chose the CTB35 but had to pack a daypack as well.  The CPL28 actually would've handled the trip perfectly, but I appreciated the hip belt of the CTB35.  Considering how much time I have to spend standing carrying the backpack (especially in ATL TSA lines - whatta mess even with TSA Pre-Check and Clear Plus), I don't regret prioritizing the hip belt.  But the CPL28 would've otherwise been preferable.  I actually preferred the back-feel of the CPL28 over the CTB35.  Maybe because it's longer and doesn't feel like it's protruding out as much.\n\nPros:\n\n* Amazing capacity - I think the length (height?) vs the CTB26 just creates so much usable space.  That space is usable both in the main compartment and on the front panel.  See my [repack](https://imgur.com/RIuo5IB) with the Side Hustle and water bottle inside.\n* Even with the bag packed out, the laptop compartment zipper felt good and secure.\n* Is \"it just works\" a pro?\n\nCons:\n\n* The same con that always exists with the entire CPL series: No.  Water.  Bottle.  Pockets.  This seems like such an easy fix Evergoods!\n* Not enough quick access that holds much.  The yoke is OK and the slash pocket doesn't hold much with the front panel loaded up the way I have it.\n* No hip belts even as an option.  Considering how much you can fit in there, I feel like they should be an option for travel.\n\n# [ULA Ultra Dragonfly (30L)](https://www.ula-equipment.com/product/ultra-dragonfly/) - [https://imgur.com/a/DEQHUuO](https://imgur.com/a/DEQHUuO)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n1dsi2frpp2d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b45adcb30f1fe307be4ffe63d3205cfb6f4b02fb\n\nI have been using the Dragonfly as my EDC for several weeks now.  I threw it into this ring even though the rated capacity for the main compartment is [only about 22L](https://www.ula-equipment.com/product/ultra-dragonfly/#:~:text=MAIN%20BODY%3A%201%2C328%20CI%20%7C%2021.8,POCKET%3A%20160%20CI%20%7C%202.6%20L) because it's always felt more spacious, which was validated by [OneBagTravels capacity test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0td6gCS6YE&amp;t=44) (thanks for the pointer u/fl03xx).\n\nPros:\n\n* Punches way above its weight - for the lowest rated capacity bag here, you wouldn't know it.\n* Still had room left in the front mesh and a side pockets.\n* The main compartment is somewhat easy to load.  Very easy to tell exactly how much vertical space you have.  The sides stay up very nicely.\n* Given its size, I could probably put this under the seat, too.\n* Very strong (ultra) fabric.  The fabric and zippers pulled everything closed.\n* So comfortable, even with weight.  I have the hip belts and they don't help a lot, but they do their job.\n* The lightest bag here, and I could definitely feel the difference.\n\nCons:\n\n* No dedicated tech area, only laptop sleeve on the back.  Minimal padding and a very small false bottom (not even sure it's really a false bottom).  Nowhere for tablet.\n* When the pack is fully packed out, the laptop compartment gets ridiculously tight.  In one of the pictures I am trying to pull out the laptop and it's just lifting up the bag.\n* Nowhere for quick access for flight tech (tablet, headphones).\n* While I appreciate the bag standing on its own, it lean to the side and didn't feel stable.\n* I don't like how ugly and lumpy the front mesh pocket area gets with anything in there.\n* Could be me, but the little plastic hinge to put the hip belt on &amp; off is a PITA compared to the rest of the bags' gatekeeper setup.\n* With a very large (33oz) water bottle, it starts to take main compartment space.  Maybe if I had something solid and the main compartment packed solid it would only stretch outwards, not sure.\n* Nowhere to grab onto when closing the bag.  If it's a real tight fit, there's nowhere to grab to gain leverage.  The Ultra material, in general, doesn't lend itself to finding a way to grab it.\n\n# [Thule Aion 28](https://www.thule.com/en-us/backpacks/backpacking-travel-backpacks/thule-aion-travel-backpack-28l-_-3205018) - [https://imgur.com/a/jFT3N0N](https://imgur.com/a/jFT3N0N)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjn4brt8b23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac84a803ffa477877dce6cf4bb859372975219ba\n\nTo me, this was a random pickup at REI.  I was wondering if my daughter would like it over the Bellroy or Fjallraven.  It'll probably go back.  I don't dislike it but it won't displace my CPL28.\n\nSide note: I might've liked it better in black, but their blue is not the blue I'd prefer.\n\nPros:\n\n* The zippers are actually really awesome.  Probably the best I have seen, period.  They are smooth, they don't get stuck, they just glide along.  And even when I think I must've overpacked, the zipper eat it all up compressing whatever must be compressed.\n* I was able to fit everything in without expansion.  I wouldn't say it was great, but it all fit.  The expansion is a good option to have, but I wasn't comparing it with expansion.  That, to me, defeats the purpose.  If I need the expansion it should be on the way back for what was acquired along the way.\n* Lots of padding, everywhere.  I think your stuff will be decently protected.\n* The main compartment is very deep.  I treated it as a top loader (didn't open the TPU divider from the tech area) and was able to stuff things down effectively (see pictures).\n\nCons:\n\n* There's so much padding everywhere.  I'm sure (hope) they measured volume with all the padding, but it feels like it's eating volume.\n* The tech compartment and the main compartment steal volume from each other.  The TPU(?) divider lets shapes poke through to the other side.\n* The secondary (brain) compartment is fairly big but not big enough for an iPad Pro 11\" and headphones.\n\n# [Patagonia Black Hole MLC Mini](https://www.patagonia.com/mx/product/black-hole-mini-mlc-convertible-backpack-30-liters/195699382879.html) - [https://imgur.com/a/hOZawlG](https://imgur.com/a/hOZawlG)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rz1o260ab23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f91e346acf2ccab0b9cbecce4cc14753a860bdc\n\nFor some reason, I've had an aversion to Patagonia bags.  I don't know why.  Maybe it's the giant branding.  Maybe it's the mass-market appeal.  Maybe I'm a brand snob.  But I saw this in the store and decided to give it a try.  I don't regret it.  I'm still debating whether I keep it or not.  It is a very good bag at this price and size.  However, it's not the best at either - it's a good balance.\n\nPros:\n\n* The main compartment really is just a wide open tub.  One thing I like is that the side walls stay up so you get a good idea of how much space you have left.\n* I like the width of the main compartment.  Fit the Thule Medium Compression cube in width-wise creating more room at the top of the bag for other long items.\n* The front panel has a lot some good volume.  It's not quick grab, but don't forget to use it.\n* Comes with a good built-in hip belt (that doubles as a shoulder strap; I didn't try it as a duffle).  The hip belt helped move some weight away from my shoulders.\n* The tech compartment (in the back clamshell) works well.  The main compartment and tech compartments do steal space from each other, but the bag does help you with compression.\n\nCons:\n\n* While there is a top pocket, it's pretty small.  Nowhere to really put quick grab items.\n* I had to get it pretty low on my back in order to engage the hip belts.  Maybe I've been wearing Evergoods and ULA for too long, but I'm not used to wearing a bag so low.\n* Straps aren't that padded or comfortable.  Again, look at what I'm comparing to (Tom Bihn, Dragonfly, Evergoods).\n* I don't understand the point of the mesh divider between the front panel and the main compartment.  Putting it away eats space at the bottom of the bag.  Keeping it in place just adds more zippers you have to deal with to get to your stuff.  If the mesh provided compression, maybe it would make sense, but as it stands it's useless.\n\n# [Tom Bihn Synik 30](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/best-sellers/products/synik-30?variant=15334842433599) - [https://imgur.com/a/C7NYk38](https://imgur.com/a/C7NYk38)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jj7mm3aib23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5adb83c48a5b2d3fc5dacf8cbc544f5ef74ff52a\n\nI just got the Tom Bihn and the Dragonfly 36 as I was finishing up all the other photos.  So very little experience with either and they're both brand new to me.\n\nTip: Pack the bottom compartment first.  While it doesn't share a lot of volume with the interior, things in the interior pocket will overlap.\n\nPros:\n\n* I think it's the [TARDIS](https://thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/tardis/) of backpacks.  I could keep putting stuff in the front pockets and there'd still be more room.  Especially that bottom pocket.  I didn't realize how much had been shoved in there till I was emptying it out!\n* Very comfortable even without the waist strap or hip belt.  Both helped move some weight away from the shoulders.\n* The various pockets and compartments are a pro and a con.  But if you can use them, it's a big pro.\n* The dual access to the laptop initially seemed kinda dumb to me.  However, even in just my test packing, I find myself using the dual access more often than I thought I would.\n* The laptop compartment volume isn't eaten away by a bunch of extra padding.  If you don't have a laptop with you, you don't really lose any space.\n* Compresses (just push it down) really nicely.  Can be used as an EDC at destination without it looking like you're carrying around a beast of a bag.\n\nCons:\n\n* Geezus Tom Bihn, why all the zippers and all the jangle?!  The first thing I have to do with every Tom Bihn bag is add some zipper silencing.  This bag has so many damn zippers, it's going to take a while!\n* My Thule packing cube wasn't great for the Synik.  I got the Peak Design cube about the same time and moved everything to the Peak Design (just pick up the stack and move it in, no refold or restack) which fit much better.\n* The various pockets and compartments are a pro and a con.  If you have large pouches and cubes, you're gonna have a hard time outside of the main compartment and maybe the bottom compartment.\n* Only one handle (on top).  At this point, I guess I'm used to side handles on bags this size.  But this is not meant to be carried duffle-style at all (even the luggage passthrough is for vertical orientation).\n\n# [ULA Dragonfly (36L)](https://www.ula-equipment.com/product/ultra-36-dragonfly/) - [https://imgur.com/a/PdGtPSh](https://imgur.com/a/PdGtPSh)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/npo2njjkb23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6eb2d79715e638340dc08d237689323f7b9af2a\n\nI received this bag after doing all my packs but had not emptied my cube yet.  I was so excited to give this one a try!  I love my Dragonfly 30 but it really couldn't handle my trips.  I only included it here because the main body is [\\*\\*rated\\*\\* at 26L](https://www.ula-equipment.com/product/ultra-36-dragonfly/#:~:text=BREAKDOWN%3A,RIGHT%20SIDE%20MESH%20POCKET%3A%20183%20CI%20%7C%203L).\n\nPros:\n\n* Plenty of leftover space.\n* It's basically a large bucket.\n* I just love the big stretch pockets.  Even more space on this bigger bag!\n\nCons (basically all the cons of the 30 apply here too):\n\n* Laptop is not protected enough.  It's the same as on the Dragonfly 30, but for some reason I notice it more on the 36.\n* A bit too narrow of a body for this much capacity.\n* Because of the way the panel opens, and the additional capacity, I feel like loading this all the way up requires more finessing of the material at the top of the opening.\n* Had a harder time standing up, for some reason.\n\n# [Fjallraven Raven 28](https://www.fjallraven.com/us/en-us/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/laptop-bags/raven-282/) - [https://imgur.com/a/Ri6opCy](https://imgur.com/a/Ri6opCy)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzh03oqlb23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a92b1e93a22992b2e67a24e01a54cd6baec4c142\n\nKinda a rando bag throw in here.  My daughter (followed by my son) wanted this bag for school.  My daughter likes it because it has many many compartments and areas to put things, which is not how I pack (even for my EDC).  But, since I just got the bag and it's in the volume range, I included it.\n\nPros:\n\n* Not a long bag.  If you have a shorter torso, this will fit you great.\n* Even though it's sticking out far, it doesn't sag like you see most bookbags sagging.\n* You can designate a whole compartment for quick grab (flight) items if you want.  However, the compartments are of different sizes so you have to plan and pack appropriately.\n\nCons:\n\n* Because it's not long, it sticks out quite a ways from your back.  Be sure to pack heavier things closer to you otherwise it's really pulling you down.  And it's a hazard if you're swinging your body around.\n* The water bottle pockets have no volume of their own and they are fabric not any kind of stretchy material.  With the bag fully packed out, I couldn't get any movement of those side pockets to get a water bottle in.\n* Doesn't fully open (clamshell or panel).  This is a con for me based on personal preference.  That said, my daughter likes it because she really only wants top access.  YMMV.\n\n# \n\n# Random bonus: Cotopaxi (Unknown model - Salesforce TrailheaDX swag - Maybe [Nazca 24L Travel Pack](https://www.ebay.com/itm/196388065128) (also [here](https://www.giftsforgood.com/products/nazca-corporate-travel-pack))?) - [https://imgur.com/a/VhbpcqC](https://imgur.com/a/VhbpcqC)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wm826n9pb23d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=158de52a7707b6591e3fa7029a7dc9cd81987671\n\nI started getting rid of my swag bags last year before realizing some were actually quite nice bags.  I had hung on to this one for some reason.  I looked at the cotopaxi site but I can't find a bag like this (they don't have an archives site I could find).  I happened to find some eBay listings Giving for Good (linked above) that pointed me to the model name.\n\nPros:\n\n* I was very surprised by how much fit in here.  I hadn't really ever used this bag (free logo'd swag just sits around for me, I don't do advertising).\n* The two big compartments remind me of Pakt, Mystery Ranch Mission Rover 45, or Tortuga bags (which is a compliment).  Good amount of depth/volume on each side.\n* Feels OK on the back.  Mediocre padding, but I think that's typical for Cotopaxi (from reading/watching others' reviews - I don't have any other Cotopaxi bags).\n\nCons:\n\n* Because it's a complete suitcase-style bag inside, there's nowhere for quick grab (iPad Pro, headphones, etc.).  Even if I tried with the Side Hustle, I would have nowhere to quick grab it from.\n* The laptop (or whatever you put in the main compartment if you don't have a laptop) gives the bag all its structure.  No framesheet.\n* Speaking of the laptop, with the main compartments packed out, the laptop compartment was really tight.\n* No hip belts, not even as an option.  I realize you shouldn't need it at this size, but many others in this post do have waist/hip belts as an option.\n\nEdit 5/28/24: adding another bag!\n\n# [Evergoods CHZ26](https://evergoods.us/products/civic-half-zip-26l) - [https://imgur.com/a/53t2JqA](https://imgur.com/a/53t2JqA)\n\nHow did I forget I have this bag? And it's right there in the range!  Actually, it's because my wife uses this bag.  I'm actually not a fan of this bag because I don't prefer top loaders and it generally doesn't stand up on it's own (though it did when I packed it out completely).\n\nPros:\n\n* Did much better than the Bellroy Venture Ready Pack 26L.\n* I was able to fit the Side Hustle in for quick grab.\n   * As an aside, at 26L, I'm pretty sure this could be a personal item and sit at my fit.  However, I don't like giving up legroom, so I still want to put the bag in the overhead bins.\n* Bag carried comfortably even fully loaded.\n* Bag stood up while completely packed out.\n* Great water bottle pockets.\n\nCons:\n\n* It's a top loader, so you have to shove things down.  I guess the nice thing about it is you don't have to close the bag and fight the zipper to see if it'll close.  If it shoves, it fits.  But I don't prefer it.\n* The brain (aka rhino horn) creates an imbalance making it hard to figure out how to get the bag to stand up.\n* Only one top quick access.\n* The top quick access was impeded by the packout (see [picture](https://imgur.com/J9c4BRD)).  None of my other Evergoods bags exhibit this type of impediment between the yoke access and the main compartment.\n* I don't like the laptop in the main compartment, but you don't lose space to extra padding and zippers, etc.",

Given the amount of bags you have, I'm surprised to see you don't have either of the Topo Designs Travel Bags - I'd be curious your thoughts on it. It was my first foray into manybagging and I've been switching between that and my Matador Globerider 45. My worry with the Globerider is that it might be too big for some airline's overhead bins while packed out, while I know the Topo bag won't be. The zippers on it are also way chunkier and easier to use than the Matador.",
