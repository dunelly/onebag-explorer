The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

Does it feel heavy on your shoulders? \n* Would you see yourself carrying this entire loadout for extended _(&gt;1 hour)_ periods of time, uninterrupted?\n* Ultimately, do you think you'll travel/keep travelling with this bag?\n* Why not handwash?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've only tested the backpack in-stores _(with sandbags to test weight and capacity)_ and my own feedback echoes yours - \n\n* Didn't feel breathable due to the back panel material\n* The center of gravity was too far in the back and kinda pulling me backwards\n* Overall comfort was not _terrible_ but it didn't feel like a a solid bag for extended carry\n* While on paper I thought it'd be great, I actually found the integrated compartmentalization underwhelming - it is shared volume so depending on your packing cubes/pouches it can dig into the other compartments - but on the upside, with _proper_ pouches/cubes, it could be solid. But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

I will do a MLC post soon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncheers :)",

                "body": "On the whole, I think it's a really great backpack. It is very well made and really well thought out, everywhere are handles where they should be. The segments are also a good thing, they change the packing style completely.\nThe biggest advantage: you do not have to open the backpack completely to get to your stuff that you need. \nBut you also have to be willing to change your packing style. If you have a lot of small stuff like I had in the SEG 6L then you have a hard time and have to search for the items that you want to take out in the worst case you have to get everything out of that segment. But what must be said is that it is not difficult to fill the segment again. \n\n\nIf the clamshell is filled the segments can also be used, of course not over the entire depth but that is clear.\nAs I said, I find the backpack is larger than specified. The segments also stand out a bit. So the backpack can increase in volume and is quite dynamic. I think 3D is called that with some manufacturers.\n\nI do not want to wash by hand and therefore have enough spare shirts with me.\nWhen I arrive somewhere I wear mainly tank tops because to me these are simply airier and when I move with the backpack I wear tshirts.\nAccordingly, I have so many shirts with me.\n\nHave thought about the all in one solution but my hair likes my current shampoo very well and therefore I do not want to change (previously had dandruff problems).\n\nThank you :)",

                "body": "My wife has the same backpack for travel. It works best in a two bag system, you should leave this behind at the hotel and bring an EDC with you. It wasn't comfortable for her to carry for a prolonged time. She didn't find the hipbelts helpful/comfortable neither as they were simply unpadded nylon webbing without any pockets.\n\nThe segment system is innovative but gimmicky. It was tedious having to empty each of the segments and memorizing what cube went where, instead of having one big clamshell to store them all. So she ended up not using the segments at all and placing everything in the main compartment... Fortunately the segments don't take up any space in the main compartment unless filled, so they're optional but it's a feature you are still paying for.\n\nAlso Matador seems to place A LOT of faith in their zippers. On the zipper side, there's no compression strap reaching from the front of the panel to the rear of the pack. Instead the compression strap comes AFTER the zipper, so if that zipper fails, you're going to have a bad time.\n\nFurther issues:\n\nThe sideways clamshell opening made it hard to access items inside the main compartment on the fly. You'd have to first set the whole backpack down on its backpanel then open it up like a briefcase since it was difficult to reach in from the top when the segments were filled.\n\nThe backpack lacked enough structure so when fully packed it would have barreling problems. There was only a single side pocket because the other side was taken by the grab handle.\n\nThe single side pocket had problems with removing/inserting a water bottle because often the compression straps would be in the way. You cannot unbuckle the compression straps too, so they're just awkwardly sticking out.\n\nThe anchor points of the shoulder straps were too high for her 5'7 frame. A lower anchor point with load lifters would've been better except you'd lose the rear laptop zipper.\n\nThe good? Lightweight and build quality. And I'd have to commend Matador for being brave and trying something new. Innovation doesn't always work out as in this case, sadly.",

But in the end I realised I prefer having the versatility to use full volume if needed, rather than **seg**mented compartments",

            "body": "This was a silly packing list, intentionally going beyond what I would normally pack, even for a work trip, to try and simulate the amount of space a normal-sized person would use for clothing. I am 5’0” but the SEG 28 still seems way bigger than the 28L suggests. Spent a week in an apartmenty-hotel, this bag held everything I needed in addition to things I didn’t. Full pourover setup (grinder, funnel, filter, titanium cup) and a Tom Bihn Daylight Briefcase. \n\n##The Why\n\nI kinda just wanted to try something new. The SEG line got a lot of attention with its rectangular chonky compartmentalized design. Big complaint with the SEG30 was that it was flimsy and not very comfortable, and the SEG28 claims to be much more comfortable. I say, my [Vapour Overnighter](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5054-188/vapour-overnighter-pack) is perfectly usable despite these complaints… but sure, let’s see what an extra $100 worth of backpack over the SEG30 gets you. \n\n##Backpack Stuff\n\nThe SEG28 has really beefy straps and Aquaguard style water-resistant zippers all around. It also has a luggage pass-through on the side, along with sternum straps and hip straps. \n\nOne side has a stretchy water bottle pocket and the other has a handle. In fact, there’s handles everywhere on this bag. Two haul handles on the top and bottom of the SEG portion to lift it like a duffel, and a webbing loop where you would normally expect one on a backpack. Both sides have fantastic compression straps. \n\nLooking inside, the SEG portion can be cinched down - [attach the mini G-hook into a webbing loop](https://i.imgur.com/cKsCkF8.jpg). There’s not much else going on in here. The small stash pocket on the top has a small zippered pocket inside it as well. Pockets inside pockets. It also shares volume with the main compartment, so a fully packed SEG28 is going to be difficult to access.It also has a padded, suspended laptop compartment. It works, I guess. I goofed up and tried to stuff my laptop in the top stash pocket, it went in about halfway.\n \n##Packing it Out\n\nThis is where the rubber hits the road, and where I think the SEG design starts to show its shortcomings. Each of the compartments shares space, for better or worse. On the way there, I folded up most of my thicker layers and put them inside the main compartment. Everything else went into the segments. On the way back, everything went into the main compartment.\n\nThe harness is fantastic, as far as travel backpack harnesses go. One shoulder, two shoulder, both fine. But the only difference between this and my MEC bag is that it feels more *reassuring.* It doesn’t change the fact that the weight is all on my shoulders, nor does it do anything to distribute the pressure better. The side carry handles and top/bottom handles allow you to chuck it like a duffel bag, but don’t provide much support or structure. Best to carry it like a backpack. \nThere’s [convenient paracord loops](https://i.imgur.com/47KQhpP.jpg) on the zipper runs that help you open and close the zippers, and you can stick the pulls through to “lock” them closed. Those Aquaguard-style zippers make it difficult to get things inside without scratching my hands though. In terms of organization, the single slash pocket into each compartment limits my ability to fold clothes cleanly. Everything’s nice and stacked until I have to squeeze it inside the compartment… unless I use the main compartment and give up the segmentation. # ComparisonsWhen I got home, I put the full SEG28’s contents into the [Patagonia Black Hole 40L](https://i.imgur.com/zoqsQ5y.jpg), and the [MEC Vapour Overnighter (33L).](https://i.imgur.com/M2B4eXD.jpg) The Black Hole could handle a 1-2L more, but the Vapour Overnighter was a fight to get everything to fit and it tends to be quite spacious. I’d say the Black Hole 40 is overestimating its volume, the MEC is accurate, and the SEG28 is underestimating for comfort. The SEG28 measured at 1050g (2.3 lb), as opposed to the Vapour Overnighter at 910g (2.0 lb) and the Patagonia at 930g (2.1 lb). I think this is where it really shines - it’s not super lightweight, but it’s close to “backpacks” that have practically no organization and a simpler harness. Compare this to the Aer Travel Pack 3 Small at 3.6 lb. \n\n##Verdict\n\nFrom a user’s perspective, I wouldn’t say no to it. It does a good job at backpack things, it looks nice, and it keeps everything organized. \n\nThe thing is: I would be happier paying less for most of the features being absent. Rather than the compression or a velcro luggage pass-through, I would prefer a way to retain my backpack straps if I go full duffel mode, and maybe a little webbing loop to keep it on a roller bag, like the [Able Carry Max.](https://ablecarry.com/products/max) \n\nBeing pigeonholed into a specific volume wasn’t an issue, each of the segments have enough wiggle room. I just didn’t like how the segments were laid out - they’re too big for random stuff, yet too small/difficult to access for replacing packing cubes entirely. When packing a SEG section out, I just kept putting things in until nothing more fit. It seems like Matador set out to make this a true do-everything bag. I think it works best if you put any “large foldable” items like shirts and pants and packing cubes in the main compartment, leaving the segments for everything else. Not the best for any specific application, but respectable for everything. ",

            "body": "This was a silly packing list, intentionally going beyond what I would normally pack, even for a work trip, to try and simulate the amount of space a normal-sized person would use for clothing. I am 5’0” but the SEG 28 still seems way bigger than the 28L suggests. Spent a week in an apartmenty-hotel, this bag held everything I needed in addition to things I didn’t. Full pourover setup (grinder, funnel, filter, titanium cup) and a Tom Bihn Daylight Briefcase. \n\n##The Why\n\nI kinda just wanted to try something new. The SEG line got a lot of attention with its rectangular chonky compartmentalized design. Big complaint with the SEG30 was that it was flimsy and not very comfortable, and the SEG28 claims to be much more comfortable. I say, my [Vapour Overnighter](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5054-188/vapour-overnighter-pack) is perfectly usable despite these complaints… but sure, let’s see what an extra $100 worth of backpack over the SEG30 gets you. \n\n##Backpack Stuff\n\nThe SEG28 has really beefy straps and Aquaguard style water-resistant zippers all around. It also has a luggage pass-through on the side, along with sternum straps and hip straps. \n\nOne side has a stretchy water bottle pocket and the other has a handle. In fact, there’s handles everywhere on this bag. Two haul handles on the top and bottom of the SEG portion to lift it like a duffel, and a webbing loop where you would normally expect one on a backpack. Both sides have fantastic compression straps. \n\nLooking inside, the SEG portion can be cinched down - [attach the mini G-hook into a webbing loop](https://i.imgur.com/cKsCkF8.jpg). There’s not much else going on in here. The small stash pocket on the top has a small zippered pocket inside it as well. Pockets inside pockets. It also shares volume with the main compartment, so a fully packed SEG28 is going to be difficult to access.It also has a padded, suspended laptop compartment. It works, I guess. I goofed up and tried to stuff my laptop in the top stash pocket, it went in about halfway.\n \n##Packing it Out\n\nThis is where the rubber hits the road, and where I think the SEG design starts to show its shortcomings. Each of the compartments shares space, for better or worse. On the way there, I folded up most of my thicker layers and put them inside the main compartment. Everything else went into the segments. On the way back, everything went into the main compartment.\n\nThe harness is fantastic, as far as travel backpack harnesses go. One shoulder, two shoulder, both fine. But the only difference between this and my MEC bag is that it feels more *reassuring.* It doesn’t change the fact that the weight is all on my shoulders, nor does it do anything to distribute the pressure better. The side carry handles and top/bottom handles allow you to chuck it like a duffel bag, but don’t provide much support or structure. Best to carry it like a backpack. \nThere’s [convenient paracord loops](https://i.imgur.com/47KQhpP.jpg) on the zipper runs that help you open and close the zippers, and you can stick the pulls through to “lock” them closed. Those Aquaguard-style zippers make it difficult to get things inside without scratching my hands though. In terms of organization, the single slash pocket into each compartment limits my ability to fold clothes cleanly. Everything’s nice and stacked until I have to squeeze it inside the compartment… unless I use the main compartment and give up the segmentation. # ComparisonsWhen I got home, I put the full SEG28’s contents into the [Patagonia Black Hole 40L](https://i.imgur.com/zoqsQ5y.jpg), and the [MEC Vapour Overnighter (33L).](https://i.imgur.com/M2B4eXD.jpg) The Black Hole could handle a 1-2L more, but the Vapour Overnighter was a fight to get everything to fit and it tends to be quite spacious. I’d say the Black Hole 40 is overestimating its volume, the MEC is accurate, and the SEG28 is underestimating for comfort. The SEG28 measured at 1050g (2.3 lb), as opposed to the Vapour Overnighter at 910g (2.0 lb) and the Patagonia at 930g (2.1 lb). I think this is where it really shines - it’s not super lightweight, but it’s close to “backpacks” that have practically no organization and a simpler harness. Compare this to the Aer Travel Pack 3 Small at 3.6 lb. \n\n##Verdict\n\nFrom a user’s perspective, I wouldn’t say no to it. It does a good job at backpack things, it looks nice, and it keeps everything organized. \n\nThe thing is: I would be happier paying less for most of the features being absent. Rather than the compression or a velcro luggage pass-through, I would prefer a way to retain my backpack straps if I go full duffel mode, and maybe a little webbing loop to keep it on a roller bag, like the [Able Carry Max.](https://ablecarry.com/products/max) \n\nBeing pigeonholed into a specific volume wasn’t an issue, each of the segments have enough wiggle room. I just didn’t like how the segments were laid out - they’re too big for random stuff, yet too small/difficult to access for replacing packing cubes entirely. When packing a SEG section out, I just kept putting things in until nothing more fit. It seems like Matador set out to make this a true do-everything bag. I think it works best if you put any “large foldable” items like shirts and pants and packing cubes in the main compartment, leaving the segments for everything else. Not the best for any specific application, but respectable for everything. ",

Pretty sure the Vapour line only showed up for a single release, it just came and went away shortly afterward. I think the fabric only works well in a \"big bucket bag\" format unless you give it a liner, but it was great. Feels like the functional equivalent of X-Pac, but cheaper. Stiff, not prone to peeling like thicker tarpaulin-type fabric. Almost like they made it from some heat-weldable stuff or the Matador FlatPak fabric. \n\nI agree that Matador is a little overhyped, they don't show up as *often* but it's almost always a purely positive comment. I've still been checking back and trying to see if there's anything they make that I want, maybe the Speed Stash for my hiking pack.",

I've always been intrigued by the SEG line and its unique look and pocket system. \n\nYeah, the common critique about bag compartments is that they often share each other's space, such that filling up one will make it difficult to fill or access the adjacent one. The only one I remember reading that didn't have this problem was Tom Bihn, specifically their bags with 3D pockets. For the SEG and many others, underfilling each compartment is probably the way to deal with it, but I'll be the first to admit this is easier said than done. \n\nP.S.

Its \"egg\" shape is held together by the ballistic shell, with roomier liner fabric inside forming the compartments. But the nice part about the Synapse is that you can see that the pockets are way shallower, and you can still get into each pocket. \n\nThe slash compartment on the SEG 28 is so large + flat and extends so far down (about 2/5 of the way down the bag) that you can put something in, then struggle to get it back out if the bag is anywhere near fully packed. Same goes with loading anything into the topmost compartment if the SEG 28 is already full, I had masks + snacks in there and had to rummage around a bit before being able to grab them.",

Get some quality merino clothing and one good pair of shoes, and never pack heavy again. \n\nIf you’re only realistically gonna use something once on your trip, don’t bring it. Don’t bring ur laptop to watch movies when your phone would work fine. Don’t bring a back up pair of shoes to wear once. Don’t bring 40 cables for electronics. Unless you’re a professional photographer, you don’t need your camera stuff. Phones are amazing and can take good enough photos unless you’re literally traveling for national geographic. Also don’t bother with a big first aid kit if you don’t need it. Realistically, wtf is a bandaid gonna do for that little scrape you got? Rub some dirt in it and move on. \n\nUnless you’re traveling with a ventilator or something, there’s no reason you should ever need this much stuff. \n\nMy thinking is (albeit extreme), is that I should be able to comfortable sprint with my backpack on my back in the event of an emergency. If i got cornered in a bad alley, I can book it and not have to drop my entire backpack because it’s 50 pounds worth of shit i don’t need. An angry dog sees you and chases you in the street, you don’t need to lose or ruin your stuff because it’s already lightweight. Idk extreme scenarios.\n\nTLDR: pack less shit and get a smaller backpack. you aren’t the president who needs a different suit for every occasion. bare minimum.",

My 14 inch MacBook Pro just fits in the separate laptop compartment width wise. There is plenty of room length wise. At 20, inches, it is a bit longer, but I have a long torso. It is a squishy bag that does not seem like 20 inches. Apparently, people use it as a personal item on a plane. The main feature of the bag is the built in packing cube segments, with designated capacities: 4,6, 8, and 10. These compartments are great for teaching: pens and dry erase markers in one pouch, tech in another, etc….",

If you want very boxy then this is it.  \n\nI’m not a fan of the hiking style either but there are many options.  If you want minimalist but still somewhat boxy you might consider AER or Tomtoc; they are two that come to mind.  Tomtoc is very affordable and great materials and quality in my experience.\n\nAlso 40-50L for city travel.  Do you commutes or trips?  If you are thinking daily use and commutes then 40-50L is very large.",
