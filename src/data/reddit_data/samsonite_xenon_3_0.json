On February 20, 2024, I received a box with the scooter but with the extra battery pack I paid for did not come with it. I went to the dynamicscooter.com to look for a phone number or chat to inform them of this but they don’t have either. They a portal where you can send them a message and they have an email address as well. I sent them a message to inform them of this. I then realized that the scooter I received did not match the one they are selling, this one is much longer (6 inches longer). They are advertising the scooter as having 675 mm in length (26.5 inches) but in reality the scooter is 812 mm in length (32inches).\n\nI decided to email Dynamic scooter to let them know (and sent them a picture of the extra length of the neck stick) asking them if there is a way to lower it. About 30 hours later I have not heard back from them but with a flash light I looked everywhere as well as on line and I did not find a way to lower the stick to how it looks on their website.\n\nThe only reason why I purchased this under powered scooter was because of the compact size. Had I known this scooter was that long, I would’ve never bought it. There are dual motor scooters about this size so what is the point on buy this? This is very bad business, doing false advertisement to sell a product. \n\nOn their website they list “Lifetime Support” and they don’t have a phone number or chat to get in touch with anybody.\n\nI have attached a few pictures so that you can see the truth about what they are selling, it’ll be up to you now to buy this product.",

I have a uscooter gt that has the same dimensions and weight but is way better performing and can be carried by its stem. This is awkward to carry by the stem because of its battery placement.

This thing was relatively inexpensive for what was delivered, and I'm actually happy that something arrived from a crowdsourcing campaign that I was a bit doubtful would deliver. So I'll extend my thanks to the team that delivered this.\n\nI also really like the headlight placement and brightness.  I'll put some gear on and see how its placement afffected the structural integrity of the stem. Initial poking at it makes me think it is safe for non-agressive riding.\n\nI've ridden scooters where the handlebars don't come up quite high enough and it is awkward to ride (and particularly stop) without squatting or feeling off balance.

I'm also not going to fault them for this last minute substitution and choice as it is probably in everyones interest to not injure people and have bad reputations of PEVs being unsafe.  \n\nHowever..... I come from the days of strapping RC helicopter motors on skateboard deathmachines and praying that today wasn't my day to die while racing down roads I had no business to be on. So.. if this seems mechanically sound enough after a bit more test riding, I plan to open up the stem casing and cutting it down to fold as I expected.

On February 20, 2024, I received a box with the scooter but with the extra battery pack I paid for did not come with it. I went to the dynamicscooter.com to look for a phone number or chat to inform them of this but they don’t have either. They a portal where you can send them a message and they have an email address as well. I sent them a message to inform them of this. I then realized that the scooter I received did not match the one they are selling, this one is much longer (6 inches longer). They are advertising the scooter as having 675 mm in length (26.5 inches) but in reality the scooter is 812 mm in length (32inches).\n\nI decided to email Dynamic scooter to let them know (and sent them a picture of the extra length of the neck stick) asking them if there is a way to lower it. About 30 hours later I have not heard back from them but with a flash light I looked everywhere as well as on line and I did not find a way to lower the stick to how it looks on their website.\n\nThe only reason why I purchased this under powered scooter was because of the compact size. Had I known this scooter was that long, I would’ve never bought it. There are dual motor scooters about this size so what is the point on buy this? This is very bad business, doing false advertisement to sell a product. \n\nOn their website they list “Lifetime Support” and they don’t have a phone number or chat to get in touch with anybody.\n\nI have attached a few pictures so that you can see the truth about what they are selling, it’ll be up to you now to buy this product.",

What was shipped is completely different than what was advertised and had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it. I have a uscooter gt that has the same dimensions and weight but is way better performing and can be carried by its stem. This is awkward to carry by the stem because of its battery placement. If I keep this, I'll make some kind of nylon carry handle siilar to what comes with the uscooters to be able to carry it.\n\nI did receive the extra battery and its cost and swappable battery was a huge selling point..  This thing was relatively inexpensive for what was delivered, and I'm actually happy that something arrived from a crowdsourcing campaign that I was a bit doubtful would deliver. So I'll extend my thanks to the team that delivered this.\n\nI also really like the headlight placement and brightness.  I'll put some gear on and see how its placement afffected the structural integrity of the stem. Initial poking at it makes me think it is safe for non-agressive riding.\n\nI've ridden scooters where the handlebars don't come up quite high enough and it is awkward to ride (and particularly stop) without squatting or feeling off balance. So my impression is that they extended the handlebar hight for safety and stability for most riders. I'm also not going to fault them for this last minute substitution and choice as it is probably in everyones interest to not injure people and have bad reputations of PEVs being unsafe.  \n\nHowever..... I come from the days of strapping RC helicopter motors on skateboard deathmachines and praying that today wasn't my day to die while racing down roads I had no business to be on. So.. if this seems mechanically sound enough after a bit more test riding, I plan to open up the stem casing and cutting it down to fold as I expected. It might be a bit less \"consumer friendly\" but would be what I ordered..... It appears to be easy to modify to its advertised form. For the 300+ish I paid, I'm ok with what was delivered. Its might need a bit of modifying, but as a concept it almost worked.\n\nIf/when I get this going, I'll send pictures... Hopefully not from a hospital bed.",

They left the pictures showing the scotter at an angle which still hides the real folded length.  I am yet to hear back from them about the extra battery I paid for but that I never received.",

            "body": "I just received mine and am also disappointed, but not yet hopeless... \n\nThe whole selling point was how small this thing would fold up to put in a backpack..  What was shipped is completely different than what was advertised and had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it. I have a uscooter gt that has the same dimensions and weight but is way better performing and can be carried by its stem. This is awkward to carry by the stem because of its battery placement. If I keep this, I'll make some kind of nylon carry handle siilar to what comes with the uscooters to be able to carry it.\n\nI did receive the extra battery and its cost and swappable battery was a huge selling point..  This thing was relatively inexpensive for what was delivered, and I'm actually happy that something arrived from a crowdsourcing campaign that I was a bit doubtful would deliver. So I'll extend my thanks to the team that delivered this.\n\nI also really like the headlight placement and brightness.  I'll put some gear on and see how its placement afffected the structural integrity of the stem. Initial poking at it makes me think it is safe for non-agressive riding.\n\nI've ridden scooters where the handlebars don't come up quite high enough and it is awkward to ride (and particularly stop) without squatting or feeling off balance. So my impression is that they extended the handlebar hight for safety and stability for most riders. I'm also not going to fault them for this last minute substitution and choice as it is probably in everyones interest to not injure people and have bad reputations of PEVs being unsafe.  \n\nHowever..... I come from the days of strapping RC helicopter motors on skateboard deathmachines and praying that today wasn't my day to die while racing down roads I had no business to be on. So.. if this seems mechanically sound enough after a bit more test riding, I plan to open up the stem casing and cutting it down to fold as I expected. It might be a bit less \"consumer friendly\" but would be what I ordered..... It appears to be easy to modify to its advertised form. For the 300+ish I paid, I'm ok with what was delivered. Its might need a bit of modifying, but as a concept it almost worked.\n\nIf/when I get this going, I'll send pictures... Hopefully not from a hospital bed.",

I also have no idea about what will need to be uncrewed to get the stem out, without damaging anything inside it.  \n\nI agree with you that this is not such an expensive scooter and they almost got it right but they shipped something else than what is advertised.  I know they probably wanted to accomodate tall riders but they should've updated the pics/specs.  I bought this directly from their website.  I paid $443 including an extra battery which I didn't get, so I'm extra disappointed.    I still have not heard back from them about the extra battery or the change in design without informing people.\n\nPlease let me know if you decide to cut the stem, I'll like to think about that as a possibility.  I have not riden the scooter as once you do that, it can't be returned.",

        "selftext": "Hello guys,  \nRight now, I have a no-name backpack, but I’m not sure how many liters it holds(see photo). \n\nI do know it’s not big enough for my needs.  \n  \nI need a backpack that can carry clothes for 1-2 days, as well as climbing gear(indoors) like shoes, a chalk bag, and a harness. I also need extra space for food and a place for my water bottle. Space for my laptop would also be nice. Also It would be great if the backpack had some ventilation at the back as well.  \nI’m not an expert when it comes to choosing backpacks, and I’m finding it difficult to figure out how many liters my current bag holds or how much liters I actually need.\n\n  \nI came across these backpacks, but maybe you can suggest something better suited for me:\n\n* Daylite Expandable Travel Pack 26+6\n* Patagonia Blackhole 32L or Refugio\n* Aer Travel Backpacks (though they seem a bit expensive?)\n* Eastpak Volker or Tutor\n\nCan anyone offer advice or recommend a better option?  \nThanks in advance!",

Super nice not having to untie &amp; retie shoes at the airport. \n\nThe State skate shoes are good but I only ever really wear them to skate. Xero Sandals are amazing. I never really wore sandals before but if the weather permits I love rocking these. It feels great getting full flexibility of my feet when walking around. ",
