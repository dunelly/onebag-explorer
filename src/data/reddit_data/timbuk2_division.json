This bag is not flashy or feature rich but out of all the bags I own(all way more expensive etc) this has been surprisingly the most joyful to use.\n\nFew reasons why, looks great to me personally, light weight, surprisingly comfortable given how thin the straps are and my favourite thing about the bag is the front compartment. On one side of the front compartment it’s one big vertical pocket and on the other side it has another vertical pocket but split into two smaller pockets for more organisation. All three of these vertical pockets have there own volume and are separated from each other. \n\n\nExample load out includes my work/personal edc with change of cloths for three days for sizing. It can slim down if needed so it won’t always be bulky if you don’t need the space. ",

I've spent last 2.5 years traveling from Easter Europe to East and Southern East Asia staying for a month or two in every country, and it's very easy to tell when someone is of different nationality.   \nThat may be so easy because my work revolve a lot around people's appearance and I've developed skills to notice, but I would expect shady subject have this skill honed even tighter. \n\nAnd even if you're traveling within home country, as a tourist you behave **drastically** different from a local person. Locals don't just walk looking around and exploring. There's a good chance, if you traveled for a month to another city, you know it better than many locals do. They just go about their everyday lives, commuting from point A to point B, not caring about what around and even rather spaced out. \n\nObviously, on't be *that tourist*, with camera hanging on one shoulder or phone sticking out of back pocket. But otherwise use any things that you like, you're already a walking sign you're not local.\n\nP.S. Possibly an argument could be made that being as obnoxiously visible as possible (think neon pink pants, neon green backpack and gaudiest print shirt) isa safer bet, because you will attract *so much* attention from *everyone*, that any criminal would stay far away.",

        "selftext": "I’ve been using a roll top backpack for 5 years or so but the lack of any organisation eventually got to me. I picked up the Timbuk2 Q 2.0 on offer before a few summer trips. Timbuk2 doesn’t get too much love here but I’ve liked them since the messenger bag I got 8 or so years ago. \n\nWhat I like: \n- Multiple pockets and spaces to keep things organised. Also, within pocket organisation. I saw some reviews about losing space because of the compartmentalisation but I actually would prefer the organisation in this case. \n- main compartment has a thin pocket for tablet , documents etc. \n- front side zip pocket can hold a kindle for easy access. \n- Things like pen holders actually fit pens well/easily. \n- luggage loop “the right way” \n- side handle \n- Zippers can mostly open one handed without issue. \n- Straps are comfortable and move around easily.

Timbuk2 doesn’t get too much love here but I’ve liked them since the messenger bag I got 8 or so years ago. \n\nWhat I like: \n- Multiple pockets and spaces to keep things organised. Also, within pocket organisation. I saw some reviews about losing space because of the compartmentalisation but I actually would prefer the organisation in this case. \n- main compartment has a thin pocket for tablet , documents etc. \n- front side zip pocket can hold a kindle for easy access. \n- Things like pen holders actually fit pens well/easily. \n- luggage loop “the right way” \n- side handle \n- Zippers can mostly open one handed without issue. \n- Straps are comfortable and move around easily. You can clip things to it using two loops. \n\nWhat could be improved:\n- The side pocket for your water bottle does influence opening the main two compartments. If you have a bottle, it’s better to open from the opposite side or remove the bottle. I don’t usually carry anything here so it’s ok for me. \n- For a bag that opted to have both top and side handles, I’d have liked a thicker more solid feeling handle on at least the top one.  \n- the bag is black but the thread used for stitching at the very top between laptop compartment and handle isn’t . It’s stitched to be internal/hidden but because of the colour it’s actually  more obvious than it should be. \n- Bottle opener seems to be a timbuk2 feature but mostly useless for me. \n- I don’t think it has a false/raised bottom for laptop protection.

        "selftext": "Hi all! I’ve had this bag for a while now, and I think I ready to give it a proper review. \n\n\nI use this bag for paramedic school and work on an ambulance. At first, I thought this bag was going to be too small- but I’m a pretty messy person, and it forces me to keep my load compact. \n\n\nI currently carry \n16inch MacBook\nLarge 1 subject notebook\nReading material\nBP cuff\nStethescope\nPencil case\nLaptop charger\nA few slim Jim’s, and granola bars\nExtra celsius \n\nI switch out my lab book with BP cuff and Stethoscope for school. \n\nThe size is great for the ambulance I’m in- it’s a BLS ambulance so it’s smaller than what you might expect. \n\nI use 2 clips to secure my bag to the netting- a fantastic tip from a coworker. My water cup usually stays upright (depending on who is driving), and I use the cup holder on my bag for an energy drink (caffeine needs the most secure spot). \n\nI can put my large cup in the side cup holder, using the clips to secure it. If that’s not available I’ll secure it through the handle using the other clip. I do wish it had two drink holders, though. \n\nI opted for the custom, because I was feeling fancy. In hindsight, I probably wouldn’t have gotten the all weatherproof, because the material is so rigid. But it has been handy to keep it clean. The purple top swatch isn’t water proof, but the rest is. The waterproof material is really nice if I ever need to wipe it down, which happens. \n\n\nThis is probably really dry and boring because I’ve been writing charts all day. Please let me know if you have any questions!",

The one feature that your bag (non-custom) has that I don’t have is the external quick access pocket. My biggest grove with the custom tuck is there’s no place to put keys/wallet. \n\nMy favorite part of the bag is the weight. It’s only 1.5 lbs and can hold so many groceries (when untucked). \n\nAlso, I hear you on the droopy aspect. Some roll tops have internal button enclosures to give the roll top more rigidity (see ILE). ",

What were the final specs / materials you settled on with your custom bag?\n\nI wouldn't be crazy about not having the quick access pockets either. It seems like the layouts change somewhat from year to year. I've even seen them include like a hidden stash pocket on the side. But anyways, can you use the water bottle pockets for keys and wallet at least?\n\nI also noticed that the current custom bags don't appear to have any webbing on the front of the shoulder straps. This is another place I could hang my keys and a wallet if I really wanted. Will likely add a sternum strap here too.\n\nThat ILE feature seems pretty legit but I can't quite wrap my head around how it work would. Funny enough my other roll top which is made by Ashbury Spector has absolutely no problem standing up tall and straight without any internal buttons. It's made from 500d coated vinyl though, the Tuck is only 300d PVC.\n\nAlso let me know if you have any tips or tricks for me.",

            "body": "Figured I would drop my initial thoughts of the Timbuk2 Tuck after its first week of use. I’ll probably do another review in the future once I get some more mileage on it. So take what I say with a grain of salt. My bag is made out of the rain resist material so a lot of what I write may not apply to the higher denier Cordura material. It should also be noted that the Tuck appears to have a lot of different layouts and configurations based on whether it’s a custom bag, off the shelf, or the year it was made.\n\nAnd another thing to disclose, I am a fan of the brand overall and generally think they make high quality products. Currently own a large size messenger bag from them as well.\n\nWithout further ado, I will start by answering some general questions using a single sentence for a sort of TLDR, with more detailed notes afterwards.",

I expect it to last many years and being my go-to casual bag.\n\n**6.     What type of person would benefit most from this backpack?**\n\n Someone who enjoys roll-top packs and isn’t looking to pack their entire kitchen sink.\n\n**7.     How does it compare to other bags you've used in the past?**\n\nIt’s definitely the coolest looking backpack I own.",

I understand not everyone wants to read all of that but if you're like me and considering one, you will absolutely want all that info. I think that's my main gripe with bag reviews on here. Not enough detail. I want to get the whole picture. \n\nAnd sorry my pictures are absolutely horrible and do not make the bag look very good. It's much better in person, I should have put in some more effort. I am tempted to do a video review once it's been in use for a while.\n\nUnfortunately I'm travelling soon to kick off a big construction project, which means I'll be switching over to my large and cheap tactical pack that I can use and abuse without concern.

The one feature that your bag (non-custom) has that I don’t have is the external quick access pocket. My biggest grove with the custom tuck is there’s no place to put keys/wallet. \n\nMy favorite part of the bag is the weight. It’s only 1.5 lbs and can hold so many groceries (when untucked). \n\nAlso, I hear you on the droopy aspect. Some roll tops have internal button enclosures to give the roll top more rigidity (see ILE). ",

What were the final specs / materials you settled on with your custom bag?\n\nI wouldn't be crazy about not having the quick access pockets either. It seems like the layouts change somewhat from year to year. I've even seen them include like a hidden stash pocket on the side. But anyways, can you use the water bottle pockets for keys and wallet at least?\n\nI also noticed that the current custom bags don't appear to have any webbing on the front of the shoulder straps. This is another place I could hang my keys and a wallet if I really wanted. Will likely add a sternum strap here too.\n\nThat ILE feature seems pretty legit but I can't quite wrap my head around how it work would. Funny enough my other roll top which is made by Ashbury Spector has absolutely no problem standing up tall and straight without any internal buttons. It's made from 500d coated vinyl though, the Tuck is only 300d PVC.\n\nAlso let me know if you have any tips or tricks for me.",

I just would have loved to see a full clamshell opening (still with gusset) with two zippers for easy access.\n\n• Why I bought it &amp; how I use it:\nUp until now I was using a Bellroy Lite Sacoche wich I enjoy but with 3L of volume and since I'm an over packer I carry too much stuff, 90% which I never use and it's heavy. I wanted a smaller pouch with a crossbody strap to force me to carry less.\nQuite frankly it's a large wallet replacement to me.\n\n• What I'm carrying:\nFirst no wallet since the Flight Pouch is my wallet (it has card &amp; cash pockets built-in).\nMy Pixel 7 phone \nMy UE Fits (true wireless earbuds)\nMy keys (need improvement)\nSome 💊 \nSmall hand sanitizer bottle \nLipbalm + Listerine Packs\nNotebook &amp; pen\n\n• Am I satisfied, what improvement I'd like to see:\nI really like it, wish it was just 1cm bigger in height &amp; depth (my notebook just fits and my earbuds feels tight).\nThey're no key leash, not even an attachment point for Alpaka's own magnetic key clip.\nAnother improvement is that the pouch is asymmetrical and Alpaka should release a mirrored version (I wear the bag on my right side, strap on the left shoulder) and a mirrored version will greatly improve my experience.\nI will also add either two slim pockets in the inside (opposite to the inside zipper pocket) or another zipper pocket (facing the other one).\n\n",

I’m a frequent 1-2 night work traveler and so my usual combo is a carry-on and backpack.  Because I’m on the move quite a bit, accessing the backpack top-down or vertically is very important - either while it’s on top of my carry-on or from in between my feet while in flight.\n\nThe EBag seems to function best while on its belly due to the half zip style and its very narrow design. It behaves quite front-heavy and the low trolley strap also worsens this characteristic.  A few times my carry-on + EBag combo almost fell over while I was in transit.  After reading a few more reviews on EBag website, apparently the design was changed without much marketing or publicity about the change.  \n\nIn the end EBag refunded me the entire amount.  Hope this serves as a useful review for someone in the future.  \n\nI remain on the hunt!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1esmays/still_searching_for_the_perfect_bag/",
        "selftext": "I’ve been on the search for the perfect bag and haven’t nailed it yet but I’m hoping you guys have some suggestions. Just for context, I’m a 29M that works in IT and travels fairly often. I don’t commute on public transit and I keep my edc fairly minimal and compact. Here is a brief summary of the bags I own and my personal opinion on each one.\n\nTAD Axiom 24: My first big bag purchase. Loved it and it was my daily for over a year but soon left me wanting for something with better feeling materials and less bulk. Admin pocket on the front is probably my favorite feature and the side “water bottle” pockets are great for long term storage of stuff I rarely need and don’t want in the way. \n\nNutsac Satchel 15: Great materials and feel. Organization is heavily pouch/organizer based and I tried but it wasn’t for me. Might be a me thing but the shoulder strap pulled on my clothes and was uncomfortable.\n\nBlack Ember Forge 20: similar issue to the nutsac when in satchel mode so I never used it like that. Backpack mode carried fairly well but it always felt small on me. Organization was great. Materials also solid. The layout definitely favors the satchel mode so things would often shift while carrying in backpack mode.\n\nFilson Journeyman: materials were great but felt like a $150 to $200 bag with a $200 logo. Lacking organization and looked a bit weird when it wasn’t fully packed out and sat very far off the back when it was. \n\nTAD Axiom S2 WX: My favorite work/get sh*t done bag. Organization is great to set next to me and have all tools and gear readily available. Materials are incredibly durable(almost too much) and it has the same pockets I loved on the original Axiom 24. The downsides are that the back panel definitely takes some breaking in and is almost too stiff. I’ve heavily considered removing the plastic sheet in the back just so it conforms to my back a little better. Straps are all over the place and I use Velcro to tame them but it’s worth mentioning. It is also a fairly heavy bag. \n\nArktype dashpack: I love this bag for everyday carry. It is just floppy and slim enough to sits perfectly on your back without feeling like it’s pulling you off balance. There is basically no floppy anything on it so it’s great for the motorcycle. Back laptop compartment feels like an after thought and completely ruins the comfort of the bag when used. Luckily they also added an internal drop style laptop sleeve and using that makes a world of difference. Front zipper pocket is terrible. One single strand of elastic with varying sizes that are too big for pens but too small for anything larger. You could use them for cables but good luck not going insane every time you try to put them back in. Interior organization in the main pocket is great and gives you a few pockets to keep things accessible but out of the way. \n\nSo that leads to my “grail” bag that I have yet to find. From what I’ve used and what I dislike and like about the bags, here is my perfect bag:\n\nForm factor: 16-20L and carry’s close to the back\n\nMaterials: Traditional canvas that isn’t too heavy or stiff\n\nSturdiness: Decent padding on back but still conforms to spine\n\nPockets: front admin pocket with organization that opens downwards and presents everything in it like the axiom. A top “sunglass” pocket is also very desired for things like keys, AirPods, flash drives, and general dump.  I also don’t care if the laptop sleeve is its own dedicated pocket or just a padded sleeve in the main pocket. \n\nWater bottle: I don’t care if it has water bottle pockets or not.\n\nStraps: the axiom straps are too thick. Arktype and Filson are very close to perfect. \n\nExtra “nice to haves”: leather accents on the bottom similar to the nutsac for durability would be great. I also tend to use the external webbing for random things whether it’s on the back of the Arktype or the straps on the Axiom.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions on the next pack I should try. Love you. ",

Other than the CHZ22, nothing else I’ve tried so far has come close to as pleasant to use for EDC. I like it a lot, and it’s extremely comfortable even with loaded up with 4 laptops. \n\nThere’s just really something special I feel when using the CHZ22 though. It’s beautiful in its simplicity. It’s almost like a perfect object.\n\nKind of feeling organization overload on the Whitley, but this is something I could adjust to. \n\nIt uses its space very efficiently! With the admin panel in this bag, my main compartment is almost completely empty with what I daily carry. \n\n**Being able to fit AirPods Max in the front pocket is a game changer for me. First bag I’ve found where they fit anywhere but the main compartment.** I actually added an umbrella to my carry simply because I have so much breathing room.",

The 2.0s of both are better for more organizational storage in the front pocket &amp; wider access with the extra zipper to the main pocket. However the 2.0s ditched the internal organization the 1.0s had. The 1.0s had more external webbing which allowed me to attach more shit. Prime example: the 2.0s have a side with no webbing and no pocket. What a waste.",

Heavy rain can easily bead through the material on the sides which aren’t waterproofed like the front, top, and bottom panels. 🙄\nIf you tuck the top of the 4sides inward on the Rogue it does a pretty good job of keeping light rain out. But if i carry a rogue or spire, i always bring a rainfly. They just aren’t waterproof.",

The inverted U pocket is slow to close with a single zipper pull.  The top clip is now plastic with webbing not stitched to the face so it  annoyingly flops down into the pocket. And, relocating the organizer to the small pocket should have been adding a second organizer.",
