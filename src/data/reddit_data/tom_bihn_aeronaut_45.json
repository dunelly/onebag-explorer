Love how flat it became once packing cubes removed and parked at the hotel/airbnb, use the bag for hiking at Pasabag, Zelve, Ihlara Valley and Beyoglu and Taksim hills. \n\nVery comfortable strap, even when I switch the bag to the front once im riding the train in Istanbul, walking at Taksim sq, easy to take the water bottles from the pockets, the size for 22’s is just nice for daily town walk, edc and tailored to my shoulder, the bag has custom tailored looks including different color of inner lining, I love seafoam and wasabi halcyon the most. Business outside, fun inside. \n\nThe looks might be subjective and people in the wild just dont care. I love the look, comfort and the practicality of the bag and that’s all that matter. \n\nI have used Mystery Ranch, AER, I still prefer synik22 any day. \n\nHate: Most probably the shipping cost is too damn high to my home country, that’s all. \n\nShout out to Cody from Tom Bihn customer service for updating me on the eta for new stock for synik22 and making sure the order and delivery was smooth even though it arrived 12 hours before my flight to Istanbul. The best customer service in the industry.",

            "body": "I just got back on Tuesday from my trip to the Midwest with my folks! [I asked for advice back here in February about this trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/1avsd4l/mnmiwi_the_last_week_of_may/). It was so unbelievably perfect (until we got to SeaTac on our way home, so I guess we used up all of our luck on the trip, haha). \n\nUnfortunately I unpacked before taking pictures, but I ended up taking:\n\n* Undies and socks: 1 pair per day, plus 2 extras each. I did not wear the extras, but this is one place where I will not budge. Women’s bikini-cut underwear and 2 extra pairs of ankle socks do not take up enough room that I mind carrying a couple of extra, and these fall firmly in the “I would rather have them and not need them than the other way around” category.\n* 2 bras: Wore both. Branwyn Essential Bralette in merino wool, no underwire, so packed very small. Did not wash during the trip, but 2 were fine for a week trip, and I didn’t think they got smelly or funky in any way.\n* One pair of slip shorts, in case I did not wear leggings: Did not wear. Probably didn’t need to bring for the length of dresses I brought (all above the knee; I don’t generally wear dresses without leggings unless they are much longer than knee-length). \n* 4 dresses (all in [this style](https://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=863600072#pdp-page-content)) from Old Navy: I wore all of them, 2 days each. Super comfortable, I have a million of these in different colors and lengths. \n* Leggings: Brought 5 pairs, only wore 4 (like the dresses, 2 days each before retiring as “dirty”). Didn’t need the spare. \n* Outerwear: 1 cardigan, 1 medium-weight athletic fabric zip hoodie. The cardigan was nice for dressing slightly up; the hoodie is great because it has zipper pockets, which I always feel more secure with at the airport/on the plane. I also bought a very lightweight [zip hoodie from the SPAM Museum](https://store.spam.com/all-products/apparel/full-zip-hoodie-with-spamr-can) and I love it so much. Still would have packed both outerwear pieces I brought. I really prefer flying with something with zipped pockets, for when I inevitably shove my photo ID in my pocket after passing through TSA.\n* Shoes: I wore a pair of [Allbirds Tree Loungers](https://www.allbirds.com/products/womens-tree-loungers) every single day. They are super comfortable for me, lightweight, and can be worn with socks. I also wore the $5 pair of Old Navy flip flops I packed pretty regularly – between the hot tub and hotel room, just running down to get breakfast, etc. I did not wear the pair of sneakers I packed and we didn’t do anything approaching a hike (had to skip Grand Marais, so didn’t do Devil’s Kettle). I also packed a pair of Bombas slipper socks, which were nice to have but unnecessary. The flip flops would have sufficed. I loved stopping at the Red Wing store in Red Wing, MN, but did not come home with a pair of boots. They didn’t have what I wanted in a size/color I loved in the outlet section, and we have a Red Wing shop in Oregon where I live, where I could buy the same boots with no sales tax (and not have to either pack them home, or deal with laces at the airport).\n\nAll of this was packed in my Tom Bihn Aeronaut 45, which is probably too big for international airlines, but has always worked as a carry-on for domestic flights for me within the United States. Toiletries go into the left side pocket, clothes get packed in the middle main compartment, and shoes go into the right side pocket. I’ve packed like this for years so it’s pretty automatic reaching for things. We actually gate-checked our bags on the way there (I only had to pull out my meds), and checked them on the way home (when we were tired of schlepping things around), but the bag fits the sizer for a carry-on for Alaska, which is what we flew.\n\nI also brought a Tom Bihn Co-Pilot as my personal item. I carry a Tom Bihn Sidekick as my small/travel everyday purse (I use a leather Status Anxiety bag otherwise at home, but didn’t want something so heavy/bulky while on vacation). For flying, I unpacked the Sidekick and packed it empty into my main suitcase, so I only had 2 bags (Aeronaut and Co-Pilot). While driving around on the trip, the Aeronaut and Co-Pilot went in the trunk, and I just kept the Sidekick with me in the car.\n\nI bought a swimsuit on the trip. I was not planning on swimming, but like 5/7 of the hotels we ended up staying in had hot tubs, and soaking in one at the end of the night before bed was great. My mom and I threw ours into a plastic bag while driving between stops (we hung them to dry overnight; they were usually a little damp but nowhere near wet in the morning), and since it was very slightly damp at the end of the trip, I packed this back home in a plastic bag as well. I actually own a zipper wet bag, but didn’t pack it because I wasn’t planning on swimming.\n\nI did not pack a rain jacket or umbrella, and it was fine. It only really rained twice: we got a bit in Marquette, MI, but only at the end of the day when we were driving to the hotel and picking up McDonald’s for dinner because we did not take into account the change to the Eastern time zone and arrived in town technically at like 9 PM when all the restaurants were closed. \n\nIt also rained when we were in Door County, WI. We actually got a straight-up thunderstorm, with lightning, thunder, and rain absolutely SHEETING down. We ducked into Al Johnson’s bar and I had my brandy old fashioned and it stopped raining about 30 minutes before our fish boil at the Old Post Office, and it was perfect.\n\nWe were blessed with beautiful weather, almost no noticeable humidity (really only felt it in the air for a couple hours one morning), and the only time I was a tiny bit chilly was when we were on the glass-bottom boat tour on Lake Michigan. Which was fine, and wouldn’t have been worth packing a thicker jacket for at all. \n\nThe one big takeaway from the trip I discovered was that I am converting all of my packing cubes to the clean/dirty reversible kind. I have a stuff sack for dirty laundry right now, but I found it to be kind of a pain that the shape of the packing cubes/sacks changed during the trip (so trying to wedge a pretty cylindrical dirty clothes stuff sack in the bag with some half-empty packing cubes was a bit annoying at the end of the trip coming home). With the clean/dirty cubes, they stay the same shape/size throughout the trip, you just move stuff from one side to the other as you wear it. I ordered 2 small and 1 large laundry cubes for my bag, since the Aeronaut 45-sized ones specifically came into stock on the Tom Bihn website. Looking forward to that in the future!",

I almost always carry the bag in backpack mode at the airport, and by hand as a duffel for just schlepping between the car and hotel. But the shoulder strap was amazing!

        "selftext": "Just a short one after my [26L-35L comparisons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1d27w6i/26l_to_30l_pack_comparison_and_one_36ish/).  I received the Tortuga 30L and Aeronaut 30 (used) late last week and was looking forward to checking them out.  There's a link to an album with various pictures of each backpack packed out.\n\nMy pack:\n\n(While my packout is representative of a trip, I actually just grabbed some clothes and threw them in a cube without much thinking.)\n\n* Peak Design Packing Cube\n   * 2 cotton tshirts (XL)\n   * 2 Merino tshirts (XL)\n   * 2 Woolly boxers\n   * 2 Darn Tough socks\n   * 2 Polos (XL)\n   * 1 Jeans (40x32)\n\n\n\n[Clothes](https://preview.redd.it/9bggs6853u5d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff952a152d49ae8f6dc3251225d4ee8232fa0841)\n\nI recently acquired a couple of CAP 0.5s.  While I'm not here to review them, I will say, I can't figure out a good use for these.  Similar to all my CAPs, they just don't meet any specific needs.  But, I included them (replacing my Split Kit and a Ghost Whale pouch from prior packs) with bars, tea, and tech chargers inside.\n\n\n\n[Tech\\/chargers](https://preview.redd.it/dkos9ccx3u5d1.jpg?width=1757&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5812ca3935f4112199046449bc114f05f741545a)\n\n\n\n[Bars &amp; tea](https://preview.redd.it/f8f3v58z3u5d1.jpg?width=1618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e710f3cd64bfbd78e2d767bd005b830808f940ca)\n\nEverything else pretty much remains the same from prior posts:\n\n* 16\" MacBook Pro\n* Aer Travel Kit 2 (toiletries)\n* Fjallraven Gear Bag (CPAP)\n* Tom Bihn Ghost Whale Pouch A5 (CPAP hoses)\n* Tom Bihn Side Hustle (Airplane grab bag)\n   * iPad Pro 11\"\n   * Sony over ear headphones\n   * Inflatable pillow\n   * Eye mask\n   * Sanitizing hand wipes\n* 10K mAH battery pack\n* Aer Go Pack 2 (for EDC at destination... more on this... see individual bag comments)\n* Tom Bihn Cache for 16\" MacBook Pro (for use in Aer Go Pack 2 EDC at destination)\n* Owala 22oz water bottle\n\nFirst up, the two newcomers:\n\n# Tortuga Travel Backpack Pro 30 - [https://imgur.com/a/kmQCj3t](https://imgur.com/a/kmQCj3t)\n\nI am as impressed with the 30 as I am with the 40.  It packs well, it carries incredibly comfortably, and I personally like the look &amp; material.  However, it is big.  There's just no getting around this: it's a big bag.  There's no way I'm going to EDC this thing, so I had to pack the Aer Go Pack for EDC, which then requires the Cache for laptop protection.  I was able to get the Cache into the laptop compartment with the laptop inside.  While I had previously comfortably packed the bag without the cache and go pack, adding these two was noticeably bigger.  I appreciate the way the Tortuga has so many options for me to optimize my packing.\n\nOne of the things I continue to like about the Tortuga Pros is the front admin compartment.  I absolutely do not use it as intended, but I do get some separation of items and the ability to keep my plane grab bag in an accessible compartment.  In addition, I can shove last minute items (or even a light jacket) in there.\n\nThe Tortuga will remain in my backpack collection.  I think it'll do even better on a non-work trip (I usually take a laptop no matter what, but won't need to EDC a laptop on a a non-work trip) or if I take a separate bag (e.g. Tom Bihn Cadet) for laptop carry.  It would also do well for a short overnight trip where my travel bag would be my EDC no matter the size since I'd be going to work and then the airport.\n\n# Tom Bihn Aeronaut 30 - [https://imgur.com/a/tom-bihn-aeronaut-30-june-2024-4hrap0y](https://imgur.com/a/tom-bihn-aeronaut-30-june-2024-4hrap0y)\n\nSo, I kinda f'ed up here.  I bought the Aeronaut (used) on an impulse.  I didn't realize till it was on its way that it has no laptop compartment at all.  For me, that's a useless bag.  Literally, I will never ever use this on a work or personal trip (well, assuming onebagging, which is my going assumption).  The family might make use of it - we will see.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm sure that because I shoehorned a 16\" laptop into the main compartment (in a Cache), I did not get the best experience with the Aeronaut.  However, not including the laptop would not be \"fair\" or relevant to me.\n\nI was able to get everything except the water bottle in.  I did have to make an exception to one of my rules, though.  I slightly optimized for the bag - I took the airplane items out of the Side Hustle and put them directly into the side pockets of the Aeronaut.  I feel like the Aeronaut would make it as a personal item, making it viable to use without the Side Hustle.  However, I couldn't fit in the Aer Go Pack 2, so I would have no EDC bag wherever I took it.\n\nOK, that's a lot of negativity so far for a pretty acclaimed bag.  On the positive notes, I actually do like the side pockets.  I find them useful to create some separation of stuff.  I can imagine my wife using this bag and using the sides for toiletries and make-up.  I also like the way it looks even fully packed out.  I feel like the Aeronaut and Techonaut are both such good looking bags when packed out.\n\nBut... it's not a great backpack, so really only useful for a roadtrip for us.\n\nI'll hang on to this till the next family trip to see if anyone takes it.  Otherwise, it'll get relisted.  Either way, I don't regret getting the Aeronaut.  I might even be able to see myself using the Aeronaut 45 assuming it could fit my EDC.  But it's really not my use case.\n\n\n\nAnd now my existing 30L bags:\n\n# Tom Bihn Synik 30 - [https://imgur.com/a/w6o5c6s](https://imgur.com/a/w6o5c6s)\n\nOK so this one gets an advantage over the other bags.  I can use it as an EDC at destination so no need for the Cache or Go Pack.  And, as always, the bottom pocket just swallows up whatever I want to put in there.  I did try a Mystery Grab Bag for my CPAP, but it didn't pack well, so I went back to the Fjallraven Gear Bag.\n\nI don't have anything more to say about this awesome bag.  It's just fantastic.  If anything maybe I wish the water bottle holder was slightly bigger or designed slightly differently.  But it works for me everytime I use it.\n\n# Patagonia Black Hole MLC Mini - [https://imgur.com/a/XcjRz3A](https://imgur.com/a/XcjRz3A)\n\nWhile I've mentally decided to return the MLC Mini, I haven't brought myself to do it.  I do not find myself hating it and even beginning to lean towards liking it.  I am impressed with it.  Everytime I throw something at it, it handles itself pretty well.  I want to find it a spot in my collection.  I think it packs well, it carries OK, and it's got a lot of versatility.  I don't think it's the most comfortable but I don't think it's uncomfortable.  I think it would get used by someone in the family, maybe even me sometime.\n\nI appreciate the dedicated volume in the pockets in the inside front panel.  I can put quite a bit in there.  I was able to put two CAP 0.5s, which are very structured and boxy, along with the CPAP and hoses.  There was still room leftover in the main compartment, too.\n\nWhat're your thoughts on these bags?",

Separate pocket for shoes/laundry would be huge! \n\nI love the Tom Bihn ecosystem; and found a used one for a good price. I’ve also had a big base camp for a long time, and love it (besides the hugeness and lack of a separate compartment). \n\nMy question is: between TNF Base Camp / Base Camp Voyager, and the Aeronaut, what would you buy?
