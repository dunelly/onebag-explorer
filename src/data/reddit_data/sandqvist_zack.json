        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",
