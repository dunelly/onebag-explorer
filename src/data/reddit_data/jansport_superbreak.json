When you color grade it, you can get away with it, but this whole situation has really frustrated a lot of the OG's who have been pleading for a proper rerelease, only to get yet another alt option.",

In June [1998], JanSport closed a plant in Everett, Wash., and one in Wenatchee, Wash., eliminating more than 220 jobs. Last fall [1997], the firm shut down a factory in Burlington, Wash., that employed about 100 people. [...]JanSport still employs about 300 people at its Greenville headquarters, where it produces T-shirts, sweatshirts and other apparel, which accounts for a small percentage of its sales. [...]Today, JanSport, which is owned by Greensboro, N.C.-based VF Corp., has a majority of its backpacks made in Mexico and the Far East.",
