And some people like the whole Goruck \"lifestyle\" with its events and challenges. For those reasons I can understand the appeal of a Goruck (I have a few, all bought on sale years ago), but it is hard to understand why on earth they're so damn expensive when it's possible to buy any number of other well made and far more complex packs for less money. Tacticool market forces I guess!\n\nI've often wondered why Goruck doesn't acknowledge what is probably a huge market for a more mainstream EDC pack for people who like the aesthetic but who don't ruck. A GR1 with some sort of fold-flat bottle pockets/pouches on each side, the front slash pocket with a velcro-lining for a removeable organizer panel, a half inch more depth to the laptop ~~crushzone~~ compartment, and the Rucker's 210D option for the back panel and straps to improve comfort a bit. I'd happily pay a premium for such a bag and it could still look very much like a Goruck.",

So I took the plunge and ordered a 21L dyneema GR1 and a 26L robic GR1 to compare and decide which one I want to keep…if any. Here are some things that stood out to me right away:\n\nDyneema GR1\n\nThe good:\nStunning to look at. The fabric is thick, has a smooth texture, and its natural pattern resembles damascus steel. While not the lightest bag at its price point its noticeably lighter then most bags its size (I do not know its actual weight). It holds its shape well even when empty. Its simply a great looking bag. \n\nThe bad:\nAlthough I do not know the durability threshold of the dyneema used on this bag its rigid nature makes it seem like it could gain permanent creases if folded or possibly even crack over time. It has a crinkle sound even when flexed gently. The zippers on the main compartment are frustratingly difficult to use due to the rigid nature of the rain flap. The interior nylon looks nice but feels thin and cheap to the touch.\n\nRobic GR1\n\nThe good:\nThe fabric has a subtle sheen. The textured grid pattern feels premium, flexible, and is silent. The interior nylon is also robic with the same sheen and grid pattern as the exterior, although it does seem slightly thinner than the bags outer shell.\n\nThe bad:\nSeems like it may not resist abrasion well. Its supple nature prevents it from holding its form as well as other versions of the GR1.\n\nMy conclusion:\nThese are both nice bags but either of them will please everyone. The dyneema GR1 is all style. It seems like it would be best used as a luxury EDC bag that you don’t get too rough with. The robic GR1 seems to hit the sweet spot between comfort, durability, and style. They both have a place for the right person. For me its the robic GR1. The balance it offers makes me look forward to using it. And thats what its all about…how much you enjoy using it.",

So I took the plunge and ordered a 21L dyneema GR1 and a 26L robic GR1 to compare and decide which one I want to keep…if any. Here are some things that stood out to me right away:\n\nDyneema GR1\n\nThe good:\nStunning to look at. The fabric is thick, has a smooth texture, and its natural pattern resembles damascus steel. While not the lightest bag at its price point its noticeably lighter then most bags its size (I do not know its actual weight). It holds its shape well even when empty. Its simply a great looking bag. \n\nThe bad:\nAlthough I do not know the durability threshold of the dyneema used on this bag its rigid nature makes it seem like it could gain permanent creases if folded or possibly even crack over time. It has a crinkle sound even when flexed gently. The zippers on the main compartment are frustratingly difficult to use due to the rigid nature of the rain flap. The interior nylon looks nice but feels thin and cheap to the touch.\n\nRobic GR1\n\nThe good:\nThe fabric has a subtle sheen. The textured grid pattern feels premium, flexible, and is silent. The interior nylon is also robic with the same sheen and grid pattern as the exterior, although it does seem slightly thinner than the bags outer shell.\n\nThe bad:\nSeems like it may not resist abrasion well. Its supple nature prevents it from holding its form as well as other versions of the GR1.\n\nMy conclusion:\nThese are both nice bags but either of them will please everyone. The dyneema GR1 is all style. It seems like it would be best used as a luxury EDC bag that you don’t get too rough with. The robic GR1 seems to hit the sweet spot between comfort, durability, and style. They both have a place for the right person. For me its the robic GR1. The balance it offers makes me look forward to using it. And thats what its all about…how much you enjoy using it.",

I saw a lot of posts discussing the right dimension for the GR1 (21L vs 26L) so I have decided to create some EDC/weekend loadout example that maybe will help people decide!\n\nIt would be great if someone has the 26L and could try a similar loadout and show how much more can you stuff. \n\n\nI am 6’2 \n\nFirst example:\n- 64 oz yeti bottle (1.5 L)\n- 2 lunch boxes \n- 1  t - shirt \n- 1 sweatpants  \n- a small towel \n- maxexpedition pouch\n- iPad Pro and a notebook \n\nSecond example: \n- a pair of shoes \n- camelback 1.5 L bottle (exchangeable with the yeti) \n- sweatpants \n- t shirt \n- iPad Pro and a notebook \n\nThird example: \n- camelback 1.5 L bottle \n- 4 pair of socks \n- 4 underwear \n- 3 t shirt \n- 1 sweatshirt \n- iPad Pro and a notebook \n- 1 sweatpants (with those it’s a really tight fit) \n\n\nI hope this can help someone with the choice! \n\nAnd please give me feedback if this is useful lol and feedback on how to pack better (organization and clothes folding)",

        "selftext": "Ordered the Dyneema first then saw the XPAC release. The yellow interior is what interested me in the XPAC initially compared to the Dyneema. I really like hi vis interiors in single compartment bags. I also own a Rucker 4.0 20L that is used 3 times a week rucking between 30-50lbs for comparison.\n\nBag weights. Each weighed empty with the patch it came with\n\n* Dyneema: 945g / 2lb 1.3oz\n* XPAC: 1067g / 2lb 5.6oz\n* Rucker: 1674g / 3lb 11oz\n\nRight away you can feel how light the Dyneema bag is in hand. It's very noticeable. It's not that the XPAC bag is heavy, it's that the Dyneema bag is just that light. If you're looking to shave ounces above all else Dyneema is the bag for you.\n\nNext I was curious how the backing was compared to my Rucker. Backings that aren't 1000D got a lot of flak here for being slippery. I'll start by saying I've never had an issue with my Rucker slipping out of position when using the bag mostly upright. Certainly haven't had an issue when I use the sternum strap.\n\nTo test I loaded each bag with 10lbs, then 20lbs, of weight, stuffed with a puffer jacket to fill it out, and placed on my back wearing a 100% cotton t-shirt. I found the Dyneema bag to be the grippiest of the bunch, followed by XPAC then 210D. The difference between Dyneema and 210D was noticeable to me right away. Dyneema to XPAC less so.\n\nGeneral differences between the XPAC and Dyneema:\n\nDyneema\n\n* Lighter\n* Back feels slightly more grippy\n* MOLLE on sternum straps\n* Ships with blacked out flag\n\nXPAC\n\n* Cheaper\n* Billed as waterproof (or more so than their Dyneema bag)\n* AquaGuard zippers are easier to use\n* Hi Vis interior\n* XPAC is said to be slightly more abrasion resistant\n* Exterior is more matte and doesn't show creases as much\n\nOverall it's going to be a touch choice for me. I also noticed that the straps on the Dyneema bag were more comfortable right away, most likely due to the MOLLE. That should break in with time. Outside that I do think the XPAC would be a better fit for the role I intend to use it for, which is a personal item on flights. I have about 21 more days to decide!",

Ultra is definitely my favorite as it’s more robust, less crinkly, still pretty lightweight, and to me nicer feeling in hand vs xpac and dyneema. It’s definitely tough to say which i prefer when it comes to my dyneema vs xpac. While I prefer the less crinkle and easier zips due to lack of rain flaps of the vx21, i think the dyneema slightly edges it out due to the shoulder molle and crazy lightness of the bag. I just hope Goruck releases non collab Ultra stuff soon. I love it so much and would easily replace every other bag I have with it if possible (besides my Rucker, I like that in 1000d)",

        "title": "My GR1 21 initial thoughts vs CT21 Tanker",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Goruck/comments/1936xl5/my_gr1_21_initial_thoughts_vs_ct21_tanker/",
        "selftext": "My new GR1 21 was delivered yesterday to Scotland. Considering I only ordered it on Friday, it was a super quick delivery.\n\nHere are a few of my initial 24-hour thoughts, taking into account that I've been using the $89 [CT21 1000D Tanker](https://ctactical.vn/products/ct21-v2-0-the-tanker-1000d-cordura-nylon) for the past few months as my EDC work bag and for general weekends. So, I'll make a few comparisons based on the big cost difference between the two bags ($89 vs $335).\n\n1. Sizing and weight:\n\nI'm 6'1\" and the 21L is the ideal size for my minimal EDC, including my 14\" MBP. The bag sits just above my belt, and I feel that if I had gone for the 26L, it would have rubbed against my belt and possibly caused issues over time, especially when walking a lot.\n\nThe weight of the bag initially shocked me in a good way. It was a lot lighter than I was expecting. I had read many reviews saying it was a heavy bag, but I think the CT21 Tanker is far heavier due to being double-lined and its use of various materials, which adds to the weight.\n\nThe GR1 is a Tardis for space, and I wasn't expecting it to be much bigger than the CT21 since they are both 21L bags. However, the main compartment of the GR1 is more of a square shape, and there is less of a slope from the bottom to the top of the bag, which allows for more space at the top. The CT21 is a lot shallower at the top and doesn't allow the same high items to sit at the top. This is frustrating when quickly stuffing your jacket, etc., into the bag as it feels really tight at the top. Since the GR1 is single-lined, the material is more fluid and less stiff than the CT21, which helps fit more into the bag.\n\nThe laptop compartment on the GR1 feels slightly smaller because it has a false bottom, which is nice. It gives that extra assurance that the bag can be put down without directly impacting the laptop. It fits my 14\" MBP fine and still has a few inches to spare, but I think the 16\" MBP might be slightly tight.\n\n2. Materials and quality:\n\nThe GR1 is all 1000D Cordura, with the exception of the 210D back panel and back of the straps. This actually feels quite cheap and looks very shiny. It's also slippery on clothes. The CT21 is similar with 1000D Cordura, but it has a 420D on the back and back of the straps, this blends in better with the bag and doesn't stand out like the 210D does, so I actually prefer this more.\n\nThe interior of the GR1 is all 1000D, and this is where the bag feels a little cheap compared to the CT21. It feels rough inside, especially within the laptop compartment and pouch within the main compartment. The CT21 has lined these with a fleece lining for better device protection.\n\nThe CT21 interior is lined with an orange ripstop 210D, which is softer and smoother than the GR1's 1000D. The CT21 top zip pocket on the clamshell is double-lined, so it feels a little more protected. You cannot see the stitching of the CTactical badge inside the pocket, whereas you can see the stitching of the GR1 badge inside the pocket, and that cheapens it a little, ideally I would like this to be a strong pocket so keys etc. don't feel like they'll break the pocket.\n\nMolle quality on the CT21 is low, which is a shame. The GR1 molle stands out as it's solid, and nothing is coming loose. The CT21 came with a sternum strap, which was nice, but I purchased the $10 Goruck one with the bag and I'm glad I did, it is such a good, thick strap and makes the CT21 strap look cheap. It's definitely a great value purchase. The internal molle on the GR1 is also great and versatile, and it's made with the same quality as the exterior, so it's solid!\n\nFrom a quality point of view, I was blown away by the CT21 when I first got it. The bag's stitching and zipper movement are top-notch. I wasn't blown away by the GR1. The quality is disappointing, and the amount of loose threads makes me worry that they will all come loose one day. There are random loose threads all over the bag, and I'm not sure how to treat them. I don't want to send it back due to the high shipping fees until it totally falls apart. The zippers on the GR1 will take a bit of breaking in and are not as smooth as the CT21 due to the rain covers over the zippers. The rain covers are a great addition but hinder the zipping process a little, especially on the corners of the main compartment.\n\n3. Pricing and general thoughts:\n\nPricing is a topic that is mentioned a lot when searching for Goruck. Everyone has their own opinions on it. Should it be based on quality, functionality, or something else? If it was based on quality alone, then it doesn't match the price. They could probably mass produce it for less and sell it for less to make more money. More people would buy it if the price was cheaper, but this would cheapen the brand and hinder its growth.\n\nFor myself, out of the loads of bags I've purchased, I've realised that simplicity is the key I've strived for in the perfect bag. The GR1 is that ideal bag for me. It isn't over the top with thousands of pockets and organisation. It's clean, minimal, and full of potential thanks to the large compartment and internal and external molle. The laptop compartment is secure and hidden out of the way, so it doesn't take up much space. Therefore, it's perfect for both work and non-work purposes. You can forget it's there and not worry about it infringing on the internal compartment space.",

        "title": "My GR1 21 initial thoughts vs CT21 Tanker",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Goruck/comments/1936xl5/my_gr1_21_initial_thoughts_vs_ct21_tanker/",
        "selftext": "My new GR1 21 was delivered yesterday to Scotland. Considering I only ordered it on Friday, it was a super quick delivery.\n\nHere are a few of my initial 24-hour thoughts, taking into account that I've been using the $89 [CT21 1000D Tanker](https://ctactical.vn/products/ct21-v2-0-the-tanker-1000d-cordura-nylon) for the past few months as my EDC work bag and for general weekends. So, I'll make a few comparisons based on the big cost difference between the two bags ($89 vs $335).\n\n1. Sizing and weight:\n\nI'm 6'1\" and the 21L is the ideal size for my minimal EDC, including my 14\" MBP. The bag sits just above my belt, and I feel that if I had gone for the 26L, it would have rubbed against my belt and possibly caused issues over time, especially when walking a lot.\n\nThe weight of the bag initially shocked me in a good way. It was a lot lighter than I was expecting. I had read many reviews saying it was a heavy bag, but I think the CT21 Tanker is far heavier due to being double-lined and its use of various materials, which adds to the weight.\n\nThe GR1 is a Tardis for space, and I wasn't expecting it to be much bigger than the CT21 since they are both 21L bags. However, the main compartment of the GR1 is more of a square shape, and there is less of a slope from the bottom to the top of the bag, which allows for more space at the top. The CT21 is a lot shallower at the top and doesn't allow the same high items to sit at the top. This is frustrating when quickly stuffing your jacket, etc., into the bag as it feels really tight at the top. Since the GR1 is single-lined, the material is more fluid and less stiff than the CT21, which helps fit more into the bag.\n\nThe laptop compartment on the GR1 feels slightly smaller because it has a false bottom, which is nice. It gives that extra assurance that the bag can be put down without directly impacting the laptop. It fits my 14\" MBP fine and still has a few inches to spare, but I think the 16\" MBP might be slightly tight.\n\n2. Materials and quality:\n\nThe GR1 is all 1000D Cordura, with the exception of the 210D back panel and back of the straps. This actually feels quite cheap and looks very shiny. It's also slippery on clothes. The CT21 is similar with 1000D Cordura, but it has a 420D on the back and back of the straps, this blends in better with the bag and doesn't stand out like the 210D does, so I actually prefer this more.\n\nThe interior of the GR1 is all 1000D, and this is where the bag feels a little cheap compared to the CT21. It feels rough inside, especially within the laptop compartment and pouch within the main compartment. The CT21 has lined these with a fleece lining for better device protection.\n\nThe CT21 interior is lined with an orange ripstop 210D, which is softer and smoother than the GR1's 1000D. The CT21 top zip pocket on the clamshell is double-lined, so it feels a little more protected. You cannot see the stitching of the CTactical badge inside the pocket, whereas you can see the stitching of the GR1 badge inside the pocket, and that cheapens it a little, ideally I would like this to be a strong pocket so keys etc. don't feel like they'll break the pocket.\n\nMolle quality on the CT21 is low, which is a shame. The GR1 molle stands out as it's solid, and nothing is coming loose. The CT21 came with a sternum strap, which was nice, but I purchased the $10 Goruck one with the bag and I'm glad I did, it is such a good, thick strap and makes the CT21 strap look cheap. It's definitely a great value purchase. The internal molle on the GR1 is also great and versatile, and it's made with the same quality as the exterior, so it's solid!\n\nFrom a quality point of view, I was blown away by the CT21 when I first got it. The bag's stitching and zipper movement are top-notch. I wasn't blown away by the GR1. The quality is disappointing, and the amount of loose threads makes me worry that they will all come loose one day. There are random loose threads all over the bag, and I'm not sure how to treat them. I don't want to send it back due to the high shipping fees until it totally falls apart. The zippers on the GR1 will take a bit of breaking in and are not as smooth as the CT21 due to the rain covers over the zippers. The rain covers are a great addition but hinder the zipping process a little, especially on the corners of the main compartment.\n\n3. Pricing and general thoughts:\n\nPricing is a topic that is mentioned a lot when searching for Goruck. Everyone has their own opinions on it. Should it be based on quality, functionality, or something else? If it was based on quality alone, then it doesn't match the price. They could probably mass produce it for less and sell it for less to make more money. More people would buy it if the price was cheaper, but this would cheapen the brand and hinder its growth.\n\nFor myself, out of the loads of bags I've purchased, I've realised that simplicity is the key I've strived for in the perfect bag. The GR1 is that ideal bag for me. It isn't over the top with thousands of pockets and organisation. It's clean, minimal, and full of potential thanks to the large compartment and internal and external molle. The laptop compartment is secure and hidden out of the way, so it doesn't take up much space. Therefore, it's perfect for both work and non-work purposes. You can forget it's there and not worry about it infringing on the internal compartment space.",

        "selftext": "\nHi everyone, \n\nI've been eyeing the Evergoods CPL24 backpack for a while now. Currently, I own the GORUCK GR1 21L, which has been great, but there are a few things that make me consider switching:\n\n1. Shared space in pockets: All the pockets share space with the main compartment, making it hard to access them when the bag is full.\n\n\n2. No quick access: I have the version without a quick-access pocket, which I feel is a significant missing feature.\n\n\n3. Inner fabric: The interior of the bag is also made of 1000D Cordura. While it's great for durability, it feels rough on the hands and makes it harder to slide items in and out.\n\n\n4. Laptop comfort: When I place my laptop in the compartment, the bag becomes noticeably less comfortable to carry.\n\n\n\nWhat I love about the GR1:\n\nThe clamshell opening is super convenient.\n\nThe overall feel and durability of the bag are excellent.\n\nThe back panel and straps are made from 210D Cordura, which makes it easy to take on and off.\n\n\nFor daily carry, I usually pack a laptop (sometimes an iPad), over-ear headphones, a lunchbox, a jacket, a water bottle, a charger, keys, sunglasses, and a wallet. I use the bag for EDC (everyday carry) and as a daypack when traveling.\n\nThe CPL24 appeals to me for its independent pocket volume, quick-access features, and laptop compartment. However, I have a few questions for anyone familiar with the bag:\n\n1. Is the back panel slippery and easy to put on and take off?\n\n\n2. Should I be concerned about durability?\n\n\n3. Does anyone have long-term experience with the CPL24? How well does it hold up over time?\n\n\n4. How is Evergoods' warranty service?\n\n\n\nI’d really appreciate any insights or experiences you can share. Thanks in advance!",

            "body": "I own a CPL24 (latest version) and have owned a regular GR1 21 with QAP and currently have a heritage GR1 21 which has the QAP. \n\nTo answer your 4 questions:\n1. Yes it’s low friction and easy to slip on and off. Best experience will be with loosening and tightening the shoulder straps - it’s what they recommend. \n\n2. No. Not from normal usage. \n\n3. Mine is holding up great but there will easily be others who have had theirs much longer and used it much more, so I can’t comment personally.\n\n4. I’ve heard good things. The folks at EG seem very reasonable. \n\n\nA few general things to keep in mind:\n\nMain compartment space on the GR1 is bigger than the main compartment space on the CPL. The CPL does have more space overall but you do need to utilise all of the separate areas - the laptop sleeve, the front panel etc. It’s still only a 3l difference so it’s not huge and might not be noticeable in practice with the way you pack. \n\nPeople have reported back digging on the CPL. It’s a matter of luck whether you get it or not. But if you do find that it digs into your lower back you can put a bit of foam into the frame sheet section (there’s a YouTube video specifically about this) or you can do what I did which is buy some foam like the frame sheet of the MPL22 and cut it to the same size as the CPL frame sheet. What that does is remove the hard edge from the bottom of the bag and hugely improves, if not altogether removes, any back digging. \n\nGoruck will always be comfier under heavy loads. \n\nOn the GR1 you can attach molle pouches to the outside - e.g. water bottle pouch, small utility pouch etc which gives you more room and versatility. Can also attach some stretchy cord to the front PALS webbing to allow you to carry things like a jacket or wet umbrella/shoes etc on the outside. \n\nHappy to help if you have any more questions!",

It’s changed the way I carry from strictly utilitarian to really my bag becoming a mobile workstation. \n\nI know that you asked about the CPL24 and, while I do not own one, I can attest to Evergoods’ design language. I have no doubts about the durability, keeping in mind that the mindset behind the design is different than GoRuck’s. I don’t know if I would confidently beat the Evergoods bags up the same way I would beat a GoRuck bag but that’s not my use case.\n\nI hope that helps a little.",

Unless someone is looking for a specific color or material, the best you can do is sit on it.\n\nAlso GORUCK and huckberry just went through end of year sales so people (including yourself) bought things during that sale and are stocked up and probably also looking to sell to fund their next FOMO purchase.\n\nSo if you're in a hurry - drop your price down more for a quick sale. If you're not in a hurry, just sit on it and wait. \n\nI've also seen your posts on the Facebook groups and what might be the issue is that you're new to both groups and haven't sold or bought anything probably. So it looks suspicious to some that you're selling a 400 New pack for 285. But that's just my opinion.",
