I would like my budget to be 150 or below but I could go like no more than 30-40 (this osprey). As shown above I have been looking at these two packs, the alps mountaineering nomad 75 and the osprey rook 65. Would want some feedback on which one of these two to get, or if there are some other better packs in the price range.",

I'm interested in hearing if anyone has used it yet, because I'm having some trouble believing these specifications:\n\n* 35l capacity\n* 800g weight\n* $99\n\nGenerally with any other pack I've seen in this range, one of those three things is lying. Either the capacity is lower (ULA Dragonfly), the weight is higher (Arcido, REI), or the price is higher (take your pick).\n\nI can't seem to find any local retailers that have it in stock, so wanted to check: have any of you used it? Is it accurate to the description? Is it comfortable?\n\nThanks for any help!",

Overall capacity is less important than where the weight rides in my experience. You can have a 45L pack with a hip belt that carries better than a 25L pack with a thin waist strap. \n\nCheck out the mystery ranch scree for a similar size bag with a great hip belt.

        "title": "14+ years of Alden Indy Boots - THE END",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/wz9b7k/14_years_of_alden_indy_boots_the_end/",
        "selftext": "Alden Indy Boots – 40X (I’m not sure of the exact model)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn case the images that  uploaded with the post didn't make it, here's a link:\n\nImages - [https://imgur.com/a/ykxUSkb](https://imgur.com/a/ykxUSkb)\n\nI bought these around 2008, used, from ebay from a guy who bought them from Leather Soul in Hawaii. They are Horween Shell color #8, which I’m sure most are familiar with. At the time, my budget was very limited so I was very happy to find these used for maybe half price. Love the speed hooks, not sure if that was a Leather Soul thing or if it’s common. It took a while to find them, I was just about to break down and get something cheaper like Red Wings, which are perfectly fine boots that I love as well.\n\nWear – I wore these like work boots and really didn’t pull any punches. I built my house wearing them, I’ve welded stuff, ridden my tractor for hundreds of hours, basically anything you can imagine. Done a lot of tree and garden work in them. I turkey hunt in them, I sometimes deer hunt if it’s not too cold yet. I grew up around machinists and welders in the Seattle area who used shell cordovan for safety boots, so that was my attitude too. I’m sure they lament us kids discovering shell, because it was a worker’s leather from what I knew—which isn’t much. With today’s prices, well, this is my only pair of shell, and sadly this is the end! At this point, I don’t think I can afford shell any longer, unless I find a good deal on some used boots. And that’s fine, I’ve really been enjoying some basic, affordable leathers these days. I think the overall condition of the leather is rather remarkable on these considering what I’ve done. My care routine is simple: brush after each use, Lexol every three months. Maybe once every six years I’d give them a little Alden #8 polish, but not much or often and I haven’t done that in at least six years.\n\nThe End – I sent these into Alden three times and between each of those, I glued on replacement soles. They got a lot of use. A few weeks ago, I sent these into Alden for their fourth rebuild. They arrived in my mailbox quickly, too quickly. No note; no work. I called, they said there’s supposed to be a note and that note should have said they can’t rebuild them. They explained that the heel counter was too far gone. This is sad news, as I’d really grown attached to these boots. But it did finally answer a question I’d always wondered: when will these die, if ever. Well, I found the answer: 14 years plus whatever was on them when I got them, which I honestly forget their condition. If I had to guess, I’d say gently used. At times I wore these 3-4 times a week, at other times they’d sit for a few months without being used more than once a week. I use a lot of different kinds of boots for different things. The flat soles and overall comfort made these my go-to pair for many activities. I did notice that in the other pairs I have of this style (black veg tan leather and Kudu) that they were a lot quicker to pull the welt out and the shell seems to have stood up a long time. I do not blame Alden for this, I blame my misshapen foot.\n\nShape – I had another pair of 40X boots, and I noticed that on both pairs, the welt tore out around the ball of my foot. On my left foot, I have a pretty bad bunion, but this consistently happens on the right boot. My right foot doesn’t have as much of a bunion. However, on three different pairs of 40X boots, I’ve had the exact same pull-out and I’ve never had it on another pair. My best guess is that that foot has a high part on the top of the foot where the bone protrudes in line with the big toe. The 40X shape is kinda low and doesn’t have a lot of ‘headroom’ in the box. I think that the bone keeps pushing up and eventually pulled the leather out. See pix. The one with my thumb in it is where it pulled out. I also included pix of the heel counter on both sides. I want to say that the last time these went to Alden, they added some leather back there, so you are seeing a few layers of wear and some leather that may not be present in your pair. That’s been in there maybe for the past four or five years.\n\nConclusions – I guess I can’t wear the 40X style anymore. Having three pairs pull the welt out in the exact same spot tells me that it’s not a good shape for my foot. I will miss this boot a lot. It makes me sad that this is likely the end of my Indy Boot days. I’ll look for another moc toe. It’s a style that I like a lot. I very much appreciated the 40X Alden take on the type, the flatter stitch and the wide boot are really good for many of the work activities that I used this boot for. The flat soles don’t hold much grease and dirt and metal finings. Every now and again, I get metal spirals from the lathe mashed into the leather, but that’s about it. In the winter, the flat sole doesn’t hold much snow, so it’s friendly to my truck’s floor mats. All in all, it’s a great boot that I got a lot of good use from and I can’t say enough about it, except that it’s not a good shape for my foot. I think this is a somewhat recent development for my foot and it’s changing shape because I didn’t have this issue for the first ten years. So I guess that as I keep punishing my feet, their shape keeps changing. I didn’t know what bunions were until someone told me that my left foot has a very bad one, so I guess that’s not good. It really does stick out, but the left boot never had welt pull-out, just the right.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for a boot that might fit me better, I’d appreciate that. And if anyone has a good idea for what I should do with these now, I’m listening. I was thinking that a young aspiring cobbler might appreciate them for learning purposes. Can’t think of much else. I suspect that there are many cobblers who would work on them and I could likely squeeze some more life out of them. I’ll have to think about it. At $200, Alden’s restoration service is a premium rebuild. I live in a very rural part of the Catskill Mountains and we don’t have any cobblers around, so I’d have to find one and mail it to them, so it seems like a challenge (and that’s partially why I’d always sent them in to Alden for rebuilds)\n\nThanks and I hope that this post might help someone for some reason. Can’t think of why it would. Maybe one thing I learned is that I’ve put probably $1,000 into these boots over 14 years ($400 used purchase price, $200 X 3 rebuilds, couple bucks gluing on new soles between rebuilds) and though my wife shakes her head at the price of boots, I insist that they work out in the long run compared to buying something cheaper, more frequently. My mom's family is from Spokane and I was treated to a pair of Whites when I turned 18 (I'm 46 now) so that stared me on the road of good boots, which all the men in my family valued. All in all, I’m spending less than $75/year to have these great boots on my feet for all that time. That’s a good deal. Also, don’t much care for new things. I just don’t like how they look. I like patina and a well-used thing. So my main issue with say Timberlands of Keens is that just when they’re maybe starting to look good, they’re shot and you have to go get an ugly new pair. So I really prize stuff that can last forever. I have tools from my grandpa made by Rockwell in stainless steel cases that still work great. To me, that’s my sweet spot. Buy high quality stuff, maintain it, and pass it down. Take care.",

I've realized that these boots aren't done yet if I don't want them to be and for something around $400+ I can rebuild them so that's pretty exciting. The dilemma is that it seems in the past five years my foot has deformed and caused that welt pulling, so I have to decide if I want to invest this kind of money in bringing these back to life or if I should cut bait and find a new last that's a better fit for my foot. That's going to be a tough call, but I'll keep you all updated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I really appreciate the supportive community here. I had a pretty negative experience recently on the Stitchdown Discord and felt like I was being ganged up on by  a pack of teenage meangirls who were fashonistas and were really into disparaging comments.

I know what they said was very blunt, the sizing channel is very sacred, to them at least, and they are not big fans of having people that don't subscribe to the church of broccoli on sizing advice post contrarily in there as it adds to the confusion many people have for sizing. u/Chinesebroccoli is very passionate about sizing because he missized a long time and it messed up his feet so he's trying to help prevent people from doing the same.\n\n Maybe your feet will be fine forever with sizing how you have. But knowing now that you have some changes going on with your feet, that could be caused in part by missizing, could be genetics, could just be something that happened that doesn't have to do with anything. \n\nI think you'll find outside of the sizing channel folks are pretty docile. Yes, the discord is generally more fashion oriented just as this subreddit, but there are definitely people who wear boots (even some boots they shouldn't) for work, including CB. You may even be able to find another pair of lightly used Indys on there in case you end up not repairing these, though I think you may benefit from some E or EE width variety though we would know better with a couple of brannock pictures.
