So while rare trips are fine, the conditioning required to get a dog accustomed to a decent size pack isn‚Äôt worth the risk to their joints and spine. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs cool though, I‚Äôm a dogsled musher. The science and anatomical data shows that dogs can safely carry only about 10% of their body weight directly on their back ‚Äúsaddle style.‚Äù However if you distribute the weight to a pulling position (where the load is behind them) many large breeds can pull up to 3x their body weight without any significant damage to their musculature or skeleton/joints. The way this is done is with an x-back harness and ‚Äúsled‚Äù system. Keep in mind though that this can be applicable in any terrain with a ‚Äúbeach wagon‚Äù or any other all terrain cart or wagon. That‚Äôs how we train dogs in the off season anyway. I personally own two huskies and between the two they can pull a 200lb load for the 2.5 mile gradual uphill from my parking area to my bugout cache. I‚Äôve done the route in snow and dry land. And it‚Äôs actually super pleasant to pull such a load yourself with a shoulder harnesses versus on your back. \n\nSorry for the text wall but I‚Äôve put a ton of thought into this in particular. The mechanics of load bearing as it applies to a bugout situation that is.",

The DRV8833 is a compact dual H-bridge motor driver that can handle small DC motors like the N20 series.\n\nHere's an example wiring for connecting the DRV8833 to an Arduino:\n\nConnect the VM pin to your motor power supply voltage (up to 10.8V).\nConnect GND and VCC to the ground and 5V pins on your Arduino.\nConnect the AIN1 and AIN2 pins to two digital pins on your Arduino for motor 1 control.\nConnect the BIN1 and BIN2 pins to two other digital pins on your Arduino for motor 2 control.\nConnect the A01 and A02 pins to one N20 motor.\nConnect the B01 and B02 pins to another N20 motor.\n\n//setnfix youtube channel\n// Join with https://chat.whatsapp.com/F83eBRjzp0HDQACxRJvM24 \n\nint motor1PWM = 3;  // PWM pin for motor 1\nint motor1DIR1 = 4; // Direction pin 1 for motor 1\nint motor1DIR2 = 5; // Direction pin 2 for motor 1\n\nint motor2PWM = 6;  // PWM pin for motor 2\nint motor2DIR1 = 7; // Direction pin 1 for motor 2\nint motor2DIR2 = 8; // Direction pin 2 for motor 2\n\nvoid setup() {\n  pinMode(motor1PWM, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(motor1DIR1, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(motor1DIR2, OUTPUT);\n\n  pinMode(motor2PWM, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(motor2DIR1, OUTPUT);\n  pinMode(motor2DIR2, OUTPUT);\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Motor 1 forward\n  digitalWrite(motor1DIR1, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(motor1DIR2, LOW);\n  analogWrite(motor1PWM, 150);  // Adjust speed by changing the PWM value\n  delay(2000);\n\n  // Motor 1 reverse\n  digitalWrite(motor1DIR1, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(motor1DIR2, HIGH);\n  analogWrite(motor1PWM, 150);\n  delay(2000);\n\n  // Motor 2 forward\n  digitalWrite(motor2DIR1, HIGH);\n  digitalWrite(motor2DIR2, LOW);\n  analogWrite(motor2PWM, 150);\n  delay(2000);\n\n  // Motor 2 reverse\n  digitalWrite(motor2DIR1, LOW);\n  digitalWrite(motor2DIR2, HIGH);\n  analogWrite(motor2PWM, 150);\n  delay(2000);\n}\n\nMake sure to check the datasheet of your N20 motors and the DRV8833 to ensure compatibility with the voltage and current requirements of your project. Additionally, adjust the PWM values in the code to control the speed of the motors according to your needs.",

Try any fancy flying and you might go squish. \n\nDue to how this works, if you use precise analog thrusters for your vertical thrust, you can land smoothly on any gravity planet. You can also land like a Space X rocket using the rear thrusters.\n\nHowever, if you use a digital control (say a digital hat) for your vertical thrusters, and tap down, you'll drop thousands of meters before stopping.",

            "body": "Just FYI: Aluminum bikes *can't* look like steel bikes, at least not without riding like crap. Aluminum as a material has about a third the stiffness of steel. To compensate for that, aluminum bikes need to have tubes that are significantly wider in order to achieve the same stiffness. \n\nOn top of that, aluminum fatigues at lower strains than steel does, and unlike steel, aluminum does not have a fatigue limit. So in fact, they generally need to be *stiffer* than steel bikes so that they flex less and fatigue less, or else they would fail much sooner. Of course, given that the material is already a third the stiffness of steel, in order to make the bike as a whole stiffer the diameter needs to be increased even further.\n\nThat's why you never see aluminum bikes with the same thin, round tubing steel bikes use. It's not just that nobody wants to make them. It's an inherent limitation of the material.\n\nBelieve me, if people *could* make classic-looking round tubed aluminum bikes with the same diameters as steel bikes, there would be tons of companies all over it.",

Like: the reason for why a 2000$ alu bike weighs \\~ 10kg and the 8000$ carbon bike weighs \\~ 7kg, is not because the carbon frame weighs 3kg less. the carbon frame weighs probably 200g less than the alu frame. It is all the other parts attached to the carbon frame, most importantly the wheels and the groupset, that cost 5000+$ more and weigh 2,5+kg less.\n\nanyway... if you take any old vintage looking bike and remove all the parts that aren't strictly needed, it usually isn't that hard to get it very light. But you can also use a non old bike =&gt; [all city big block](https://allcitycycles.com/bikes/big_block) (there are dozens of other brands, that make similar looking bikes for roughly the same price).",

        "selftext": "Backpacks come up a lot in this sub. We wanted to collect the best advice and models in a one-page purchasing guide, so we've spent the last year interviewing bag experts and reviewing hundreds of models (500+ total, 250+ in person, 100 in the field).\n\nHere's roughly 1/3rd of the bags we tested for this: [https://imgur.com/lIJfiNp.jpg](https://imgur.com/lIJfiNp.jpg)\n\nWhich included packing each bag with a BOB kit [similar to this one](https://theprepared.com/kits/cc3umntl) to see how well it holds common prepper gear.\n\nThe most important advice:\n\n* Stick with two-strap backpacks. Don't bother with sling bags, messenger bags, etc.\n* There are no bags with new MSRPs under $75 that are good enough. If you're on a tight budget, it's better to buy a used premium pack than a new crap one. Cheap bags will fall apart.\n* Mid-tier bags are around $125-$275. Premium-but-worth-it bags are up to \\~$400. Some brands like Mystery Ranch and Eberlestock can get more expensive, some of which are worth it and some of which aren't.\n* Hip belts are a must for any bag over \\~35 liters / a small basic bag because you want to carry weight on your strong hips, not hanging from your shoulders.\n* Most people end up in the 40-55L range. Below 35L is too limiting for most, and you shouldn't go over 65L unless you're already experienced with those sizes.\n* Blend in by avoiding camo, bright colors, overdone MOLLE/PALS webbing, and morale patches.\n* People who want comfort and light weight favor technical bags (like what you'd find at REI) and those who want durability and customization favor tactical bags (what you'd find in military / hunting)\n* Fit matters. Visit a local store like REI if you've never gone through this before, they have gear/training to help.\n* Avoid technical packs that only open from the top, as you don't want to dump out all your gear to get to what you need.\n* 500-600D (denier) is the sweet spot on materials. Don't go below 400 (it isn't durable enough) and up to 1000 is fine, but you're carrying unnecessary weight in most cases.\n\n[The full review has \\~40 recommended bags in various price and size tiers](https://theprepared.com/bug-out-bags/reviews/best-bug-out-bag-backpack/?utm_source=rdtprprs&amp;utm_medium=forum&amp;utm_campaign=backpack). \n\nSome of our favorites:\n\n* 3V Gear Paratus 3-Day ‚Äî one of the best cheap bags, includes a removable hip bag.\n* Kelty Redwing 50 ‚Äî a common beginner's bag around $140\n* 5.11 RUSH72 ‚Äî one of the most common bug out bags, but we wish it had less PALs. \n* Osprey Aether 60 (mens) and Ariel 55 (womens) ‚Äî traditional and comfy hiking bag\n* Goruck GR3 ‚Äî¬†now with less-insane pricing\n* Hill People Gear Aston House Backcountry ‚Äî customizable while still blending in \n* Tasmanian Tiger Modular Pack 45 Plus ‚Äî comes with great interior velcro organization\n\nAs always, would love to hear about your experiences with different bags or if we should add anything to the purchasing guide. Keep in mind that bag choice can be very quirky and personal.\n\n*(We're in Vegas for SHOT Show this week and Denver for Outdoor Retailer next week ‚Äî PM us if you're around and want to say hi!)*",

As a reminder, drops will NOT have the Found in Raid status.\n\nIf you don't know how to enable drops or want a refresher on how to double check you've got it enabled, check this news post on [www.EscapeFromTarkov.com](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/169) (Which also has a list of drop enabled streamers).\n\nPost your hype, your pictures of what you got, and discuss the event here in this sticky or talk about how your favorite streamer is doing today.\n\n**Some answers to common questions**:\n\n* You only need 1 stream open to get drops (if you don't want to listen to it, just mute the tab within your browser, don't mute the stream itself).  [More than one won't help you get more drops.](https://old.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/h0tbtx/twitch_drops_live_today_20200611_1100msk/ftofzbl/)\n\n* Viewing Twitch streams on mobile and other devices will still count as long as you're logged into Twitch &amp; have your EFT account linked.\n\n* You will receive your drops in game via a [in-game message from Prapor](https://i.imgur.com/9xVZ2Ik.png).  You can also see what you've received via [Twitch Inventory](https://www.twitch.tv/inventory).  \n\nEdit: Drops are live!",

Initially the drops were scheduled through June 21 although it looks like they've extended them to the 22nd but with the timezone difference it's hard to calculate the max number of drops, it may be more like 80-100 potential drops.\n\nThere probably is a static loot pool of drop items but I suspect that the size of the pool is larger than the possible number of drop opportunities which means that if 2 people got drops at every opportunity they will have a fair amount of overlap but they will get some different items too. I've seen enough variation from what other people say they are getting that would not make up for the drops I've missed, meaning there are more items than opportunities.",
