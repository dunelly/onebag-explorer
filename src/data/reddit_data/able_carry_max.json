Have used it on two trips so far and put it through the paces at a few airports and rental cars. \n\nBottom line up front (tldr):\n hands-down, the most versatile EDC bag I’ve ever had. It’s comfortable, has all the right quick access compartments, extremely sturdy (I have the Earth green X-42 version so a little beefier), and is easy to handle. It is just the right size large EDC without being too big or bulky. If you need a large but versatile EDC look no further. It does have some areas needing improvement, but they are relatively minor with maybe one exception.\nRate 1-10\nComfort: 7\nForm: 9\nFunction: 10\nValue: 9\nAccessibility: 10\n\nI’ve carried rucksacks, backpacks of all types, messenger bags, sling bags, daypacks, you name it. I’ve carried gear in the military and for public safety as well as hiking hundreds of miles. This is my favorite bag. you could take this hiking, as a carry-on, to work, it seems to blend in everywhere. \n\nComfort: the bag is comfortable but compared to Evergoods and the ultimate king of comfort (Aer) it’s a distant third. some may think 7 is a harsh score but I’m knocking it down for a couple reasons. One, the straps are thick, padded, and ventilated but are super finicky to get right, at least for me, ymmv. Aer bags have a gusset at the top of the straps that flex which helps immensely with comfort. This bag needs that. The backpad is comfortable but somewhat stiff. Should have more foam though. The frame sheet is actually soft but it’s sturdy. \nAs Redditor - Wielderofmysteries pointed out, The tabs at the bottom that hold the straps are annoying, bordering on painful.

        "selftext": "So I decided to do an in-depth review of the Able Carry Max EDC. Have used it on two trips so far and put it through the paces at a few airports and rental cars. \n\nBottom line up front (tldr):\n hands-down, the most versatile EDC bag I’ve ever had. It’s comfortable, has all the right quick access compartments, extremely sturdy (I have the Earth green X-42 version so a little beefier), and is easy to handle. It is just the right size large EDC without being too big or bulky. If you need a large but versatile EDC look no further. It does have some areas needing improvement, but they are relatively minor with maybe one exception.\nRate 1-10\nComfort: 7\nForm: 9\nFunction: 10\nValue: 9\nAccessibility: 10\n\nI’ve carried rucksacks, backpacks of all types, messenger bags, sling bags, daypacks, you name it. I’ve carried gear in the military and for public safety as well as hiking hundreds of miles. This is my favorite bag. you could take this hiking, as a carry-on, to work, it seems to blend in everywhere. \n\nComfort: the bag is comfortable but compared to Evergoods and the ultimate king of comfort (Aer) it’s a distant third. some may think 7 is a harsh score but I’m knocking it down for a couple reasons. One, the straps are thick, padded, and ventilated but are super finicky to get right, at least for me, ymmv. Aer bags have a gusset at the top of the straps that flex which helps immensely with comfort. This bag needs that. The backpad is comfortable but somewhat stiff. Should have more foam though. The frame sheet is actually soft but it’s sturdy. \nAs Redditor - Wielderofmysteries pointed out, The tabs at the bottom that hold the straps are annoying, bordering on painful. I think they will loosen up but they need to be broken in. You have to wear the pack really high to mitigate the problem but puts additional strain on your shoulders. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/HpjvQANF2q\n\nForm: \nAble Carry knocked the design out of the park. It somehow has a tactical AND tech vibe but also fits in with office. Especially blue and black colors. Green works well without being too tactical. Desert tan? Yuck. They Should have went with a much darker coyote. \n18 external Molle loops. more than you will ever need. \n2 red key leash hoops. One in duffel the other in the right side pocket. Weird that none of the top access pouches have one.\n6 beige webbing loops in main compartment to attach gear. \n2 grab handles. Sturdy but not very comfortable. \nThe interior liners are a mix of soft stretch fabric and 420D nylon. Both high quality and really nice to the touch. \nThe layout of the external and quick access pouches is phenomenal. Best I’ve ever seen in a pack. The pack dimensions are great. Not too tall, nor too wide or deep. It’s just right. Fit under seat in a A320 great but stuck out a bit.\nThe internal water bottle pocket takes up space in the main compartment and it’s not ideal. I used it but never zipped it up and let it hang out. \nThe 80% zip for the main compartment is the way every EDC bag should be so I LOVE that it’s not a clamshell. No self respecting EDC should be :)\n\nFunction:\nThe two carrying handles although not very soft, work well when manipulating the bag. Actually the side handle keeps the bag level. Not sure how they did that. \nThe small hook on the back is great for an airport lavatory or on the back of an office door. \n It’s also easy to put the straps on as they are sturdy yet malleable. and the Fidlock buckle you ask? Very well done! Way easier to clasp than the Aer Fidlock. \nGetting in to the external and quick access pockets is a treat. The semi hidden pocket near the backpad is much bigger than I would have thought and it is easy to get to and open one handed if you set the pack down. \nWith the pack on you can get to the side pocket easily (but the divider in the pocket is a pain in the butt). The duffel pouch is also easily accessed with the pack on. \nThe main compartment is easy to open with the large #10 zippers. Packing it is tricky though. The zippered pouches in the main compartment are not very useful, but you can put smaller or thinner items in there. The trick is to take up the whole space of the pouch without adding much bulk. Put taller items in the back of the compartment, and add pouches or cubes vertically from the bottom. I feel like you can use the webbing loops to hang pouches like the TB bags, but haven’t figure it out yet. \nThe top stash pouch connected to the laptop compartment is also spacious and great to shove items that you don’t need often but occasionally. \n\nValue: \nThe bad is less expensive than their Aer, Evergoods, and Alpaka competitors but not by much really. Still a great value for what you get \n\nAccessibility:\nAll the pockets and compartments are easy to get to, easy to open, and easy to manipulate with maybe the exception of the main compartment which can be a bit tricky to pack vertically.\n\nImprovements: \nAs amazing as this bag is it has some areas for Improvement. \n- The straps and backpad need softer padding for its size \n- Straps need a gusset at top \nCould use load lifters for this size bag\n- The tabs at the bottom of the straps need to be a softer flex material and not stab you\n- The handles could use way more padding as well. \n- The water bottle pocket is senseless. Why take up interior space when you could just have an elastic pocket on the outside? Who cares about a cleaner look for a dedicated EDC bag?\n\nTo close. In spite of some needed improvements this is the best large EDC bag I’ve ever used. \n\n\n",

EDC in the military, law enforcement, fire, medical, or public safety communities often have to blend personal gear with work equipment and often need this kind of space. If you were just using it to go back-and-forth to a desk job or school for example, you probably don’t need a 26L backpack at all and shouldn’t be looking at this. When I travel a use a roller in conjunction with this so I’m not trying to one bag this for Travel. This is really a use case for people who need a large EDC only. I had a different experience when I packed it out fully, but to your point I was very cautious about what I put in which pockets so I could synchronize the space.

        "selftext": "So I decided to do an in-depth review of the Able Carry Max EDC. Have used it on two trips so far and put it through the paces at a few airports and rental cars. \n\nBottom line up front (tldr):\n hands-down, the most versatile EDC bag I’ve ever had. It’s comfortable, has all the right quick access compartments, extremely sturdy (I have the Earth green X-42 version so a little beefier), and is easy to handle. It is just the right size large EDC without being too big or bulky. If you need a large but versatile EDC look no further. It does have some areas needing improvement, but they are relatively minor with maybe one exception.\nRate 1-10\nComfort: 7\nForm: 9\nFunction: 10\nValue: 9\nAccessibility: 10\n\nI’ve carried rucksacks, backpacks of all types, messenger bags, sling bags, daypacks, you name it. I’ve carried gear in the military and for public safety as well as hiking hundreds of miles. This is my favorite bag. you could take this hiking, as a carry-on, to work, it seems to blend in everywhere. \n\nComfort: the bag is comfortable but compared to Evergoods and the ultimate king of comfort (Aer) it’s a distant third. some may think 7 is a harsh score but I’m knocking it down for a couple reasons. One, the straps are thick, padded, and ventilated but are super finicky to get right, at least for me, ymmv. Aer bags have a gusset at the top of the straps that flex which helps immensely with comfort. This bag needs that. The backpad is comfortable but somewhat stiff. Should have more foam though. The frame sheet is actually soft but it’s sturdy. \nAs Redditor - Wielderofmysteries pointed out, The tabs at the bottom that hold the straps are annoying, bordering on painful. I think they will loosen up but they need to be broken in. You have to wear the pack really high to mitigate the problem but puts additional strain on your shoulders. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/HpjvQANF2q\n\nForm: \nAble Carry knocked the design out of the park. It somehow has a tactical AND tech vibe but also fits in with office. Especially blue and black colors. Green works well without being too tactical. Desert tan? Yuck.

Weird that none of the top access pouches have one.\n6 beige webbing loops in main compartment to attach gear. \n2 grab handles. Sturdy but not very comfortable. \nThe interior liners are a mix of soft stretch fabric and 420D nylon. Both high quality and really nice to the touch. \nThe layout of the external and quick access pouches is phenomenal. Best I’ve ever seen in a pack. The pack dimensions are great. Not too tall, nor too wide or deep. It’s just right. Fit under seat in a A320 great but stuck out a bit.\nThe internal water bottle pocket takes up space in the main compartment and it’s not ideal. I used it but never zipped it up and let it hang out. \nThe 80% zip for the main compartment is the way every EDC bag should be so I LOVE that it’s not a clamshell.

Not sure how they did that. \nThe small hook on the back is great for an airport lavatory or on the back of an office door. \n It’s also easy to put the straps on as they are sturdy yet malleable. and the Fidlock buckle you ask? Very well done! Way easier to clasp than the Aer Fidlock. \nGetting in to the external and quick access pockets is a treat. The semi hidden pocket near the backpad is much bigger than I would have thought and it is easy to get to and open one handed if you set the pack down. \nWith the pack on you can get to the side pocket easily (but the divider in the pocket is a pain in the butt). The duffel pouch is also easily accessed with the pack on. \nThe main compartment is easy to open with the large #10 zippers. Packing it is tricky though. The zippered pouches in the main compartment are not very useful, but you can put smaller or thinner items in there. The trick is to take up the whole space of the pouch without adding much bulk.

It’s comfortable, has all the right quick access compartments, extremely sturdy (I have the Earth green X-42 version so a little beefier), and is easy to handle.

One, the straps are thick, padded, and ventilated but are super finicky to get right, at least for me, ymmv. Aer bags have a gusset at the top of the straps that flex which helps immensely with comfort. This bag needs that. The backpad is comfortable but somewhat stiff. Should have more foam though. The frame sheet is actually soft but it’s sturdy. \nAs Redditor - Wielderofmysteries pointed out, The tabs at the bottom that hold the straps are annoying, bordering on painful.

Used a loadout 20L backpack from Wandrd without load lifter it was painfully uncomfortable. On the closeable water bottle pocket - I actually look forward to use this pocket for non-water-bottle storage like a separate camera lens pocket. So I can swap out the lens without needing to open the main compartment. Other backpacks with side pockets just don't have enough room for a bigger lens. This feature alone nailed the purchase for me. But that being said, it's my unique wish as I'm not likely going to pack out the main compartment to care if the space is partially taken by the water bottle. My Earth Green has just landed in LAX. Hopefully it will make it up north soon to prove my concept.",

        "title": "Able Carry Max EDC: Full review after initial carry",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1gifvmn/able_carry_max_edc_full_review_after_initial_carry/",
        "selftext": "So I decided to do an in-depth review of the Able Carry Max EDC. Have used it on two trips so far and put it through the paces at a few airports and rental cars. \n\nBottom line up front (tldr):\n hands-down, the most versatile EDC bag I’ve ever had. It’s comfortable, has all the right quick access compartments, extremely sturdy (I have the Earth green X-42 version so a little beefier), and is easy to handle. It is just the right size large EDC without being too big or bulky. If you need a large but versatile EDC look no further. It does have some areas needing improvement, but they are relatively minor with maybe one exception.\nRate 1-10\nComfort: 7\nForm: 9\nFunction: 10\nValue: 9\nAccessibility: 10\n\nI’ve carried rucksacks, backpacks of all types, messenger bags, sling bags, daypacks, you name it. I’ve carried gear in the military and for public safety as well as hiking hundreds of miles. This is my favorite bag. you could take this hiking, as a carry-on, to work, it seems to blend in everywhere. \n\nComfort: the bag is comfortable but compared to Evergoods and the ultimate king of comfort (Aer) it’s a distant third. some may think 7 is a harsh score but I’m knocking it down for a couple reasons. One, the straps are thick, padded, and ventilated but are super finicky to get right, at least for me, ymmv. Aer bags have a gusset at the top of the straps that flex which helps immensely with comfort. This bag needs that. The backpad is comfortable but somewhat stiff. Should have more foam though. The frame sheet is actually soft but it’s sturdy. \nAs Redditor - Wielderofmysteries pointed out, The tabs at the bottom that hold the straps are annoying, bordering on painful. I think they will loosen up but they need to be broken in. You have to wear the pack really high to mitigate the problem but puts additional strain on your shoulders. \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/s/HpjvQANF2q\n\nForm: \nAble Carry knocked the design out of the park. It somehow has a tactical AND tech vibe but also fits in with office. Especially blue and black colors. Green works well without being too tactical. Desert tan? Yuck. They Should have went with a much darker coyote. \n18 external Molle loops. more than you will ever need. \n2 red key leash hoops. One in duffel the other in the right side pocket. Weird that none of the top access pouches have one.\n6 beige webbing loops in main compartment to attach gear. \n2 grab handles. Sturdy but not very comfortable. \nThe interior liners are a mix of soft stretch fabric and 420D nylon. Both high quality and really nice to the touch. \nThe layout of the external and quick access pouches is phenomenal. Best I’ve ever seen in a pack. The pack dimensions are great. Not too tall, nor too wide or deep. It’s just right. Fit under seat in a A320 great but stuck out a bit.\nThe internal water bottle pocket takes up space in the main compartment and it’s not ideal. I used it but never zipped it up and let it hang out. \nThe 80% zip for the main compartment is the way every EDC bag should be so I LOVE that it’s not a clamshell. No self respecting EDC should be :)\n\nFunction:\nThe two carrying handles although not very soft, work well when manipulating the bag. Actually the side handle keeps the bag level. Not sure how they did that. \nThe small hook on the back is great for an airport lavatory or on the back of an office door. \n It’s also easy to put the straps on as they are sturdy yet malleable. and the Fidlock buckle you ask? Very well done! Way easier to clasp than the Aer Fidlock. \nGetting in to the external and quick access pockets is a treat. The semi hidden pocket near the backpad is much bigger than I would have thought and it is easy to get to and open one handed if you set the pack down. \nWith the pack on you can get to the side pocket easily (but the divider in the pocket is a pain in the butt). The duffel pouch is also easily accessed with the pack on. \nThe main compartment is easy to open with the large #10 zippers. Packing it is tricky though. The zippered pouches in the main compartment are not very useful, but you can put smaller or thinner items in there. The trick is to take up the whole space of the pouch without adding much bulk. Put taller items in the back of the compartment, and add pouches or cubes vertically from the bottom. I feel like you can use the webbing loops to hang pouches like the TB bags, but haven’t figure it out yet. \nThe top stash pouch connected to the laptop compartment is also spacious and great to shove items that you don’t need often but occasionally. \n\nValue: \nThe bad is less expensive than their Aer, Evergoods, and Alpaka competitors but not by much really. Still a great value for what you get \n\nAccessibility:\nAll the pockets and compartments are easy to get to, easy to open, and easy to manipulate with maybe the exception of the main compartment which can be a bit tricky to pack vertically.\n\nImprovements: \nAs amazing as this bag is it has some areas for Improvement. \n- The straps and backpad need softer padding for its size \n- Straps need a gusset at top \nCould use load lifters for this size bag\n- The tabs at the bottom of the straps need to be a softer flex material and not stab you\n- The handles could use way more padding as well. \n- The water bottle pocket is senseless. Why take up interior space when you could just have an elastic pocket on the outside? Who cares about a cleaner look for a dedicated EDC bag?\n\nTo close. In spite of some needed improvements this is the best large EDC bag I’ve ever used. \n\n\n",

Although since I’m a shorter person the supposition that it was designed for shorter or even thinner people is likely not the reason. I think the bag needs to be broken in to loosen those tabs. Also the bag needs to be fitted fairly precisely. I took mine in to REI and asked them to help set it up. The straps and back panel aren’t as comfortable as the AER bags either. Outside of that the max EDC is an incredible piece of gear.",

Whilst doing some testing and comparing, I've noticed the ends/tips of the A-frame are the ends of the bottom mounted 1000D cordura base that is stitched onto the straps. Because they are relatively stiff, they stab me in my lower back. \n\nNext to AC is my Evade 1.5 2023 in twill. As you can see the ends of the straps are a soft material, and is pliable.  \n  \nThe only way to alleviate the problem is either to wear the bag so high and tight on my back I can barely get it on, use the old towel trick with a relatively thick towel which miss-shapes the bag. It seems like they likely fit tested the bag mostly with individuals of small stature (makes sense as AC is a Hong Kong company). As a larger framed red blooded Canadian with wider back, I don't think this will work for me... :( \n\nBag is way better in person than it seemed online though. Also much lighter than claimed. It is much lighter than my Evade 1.5 despite being only .1 or .2 oz lighter on paper.",

This is my first time investing in a quality bag, and with my budget, I’m trying to avoid picking something I’ll regret later.\n\nWhat I need:\n\t•\tShould fit a 17-inch gaming laptop (40 × 27 × 2.5 cm)\n\t•\tShould fit my lunch container (around 15 cm wide) without needing to tilt it awkwardly\n\t•\tShouldn’t look too bulky for office use, especially on light days\n\nCurrent bag situation:\nI’m using a basic 19L backpack that barely handles my daily stuff. On heavy days, I have to carry extra gear by hand, which gets really inconvenient — that’s why I’m upgrading.\n\nMy loadout:\nLight days:\n\t•\t17-inch laptop\n\t•\t11-inch iPad\n\t•\tLunch container\n\t•\t32 oz water bottle\n\t•\t16 oz coffee tumbler\n\t•\tSweater\n\t•\tPlanner\n\t•\tSmall notebooks\n\t•\tChargers\n\nHeavy days (everything above + extras):\n\t•\tMechanical keyboard\n\t•\tBulky laptop stand\n\t•\tMouse\n\t•\tOffice supplies (calculator, pens, hard drives, etc.)\n\t•\tExtra cables\n\nBags I’m choosing between:\n\t•\tAlpaka Elements Travel Backpack 35L\n\t•\tBlack Ember Citadel R3 25L\n\t•\tAble Carry Max EDC 26L\n\nI picked these after lots of research.

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just picked up the Able Carry Max EDC, and I have to say—this bag is incredible. The materials are next-level. The X-Pac fabric feels super premium, lightweight, and durable, with that signature crinkly look that just screams quality. I can tell this thing is built to last.\n\nComfort-wise, it’s one of the best backpacks I’ve ever used. The padding on the shoulder straps is plush, the back panel is well-ventilated, and even when fully loaded, it distributes weight like a champ. I’ve had it on for long periods, and it just molds to my back perfectly.\n\nThe organization is where this bag really shines. Everything has its place—the quick-access top pocket is a lifesaver, the main compartment opens up wide for easy packing, and the laptop sleeve is nicely padded. I also love the internal organization  that keep my gear from turning into a black hole of chaos.\n\nNow, my one gripe—there’s this side pocket that is just way too tight. I love the idea of a slim side stash, but it’s a struggle to get anything in or out. I wish it had just a little more give to make it more functional.\n\nAside from that minor issue, this bag is practically perfect for everyday carry. If you’re on the fence about it, I highly recommend giving it a shot!",

        "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just picked up the Able Carry Max EDC, and I have to say—this bag is incredible. The materials are next-level. The X-Pac fabric feels super premium, lightweight, and durable, with that signature crinkly look that just screams quality. I can tell this thing is built to last.\n\nComfort-wise, it’s one of the best backpacks I’ve ever used. The padding on the shoulder straps is plush, the back panel is well-ventilated, and even when fully loaded, it distributes weight like a champ. I’ve had it on for long periods, and it just molds to my back perfectly.\n\nThe organization is where this bag really shines. Everything has its place—the quick-access top pocket is a lifesaver, the main compartment opens up wide for easy packing, and the laptop sleeve is nicely padded. I also love the internal organization  that keep my gear from turning into a black hole of chaos.\n\nNow, my one gripe—there’s this side pocket that is just way too tight. I love the idea of a slim side stash, but it’s a struggle to get anything in or out. I wish it had just a little more give to make it more functional.\n\nAside from that minor issue, this bag is practically perfect for everyday carry. If you’re on the fence about it, I highly recommend giving it a shot!",

        "selftext": "I'm on a quest to find my right bag. I started off getting the [Able Carry Daily Plus](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/15z7z2b/able_carry_daily_plus_review/) and the [Vertx Ardennes](https://vertx.com/ardennes-holiday-bag), but found neither suited me well. The ACDP was too small for what I wanted to carry. Meanwhile the Ardennes had enough space, but I found it uncomfortable. While I liked the features of the ACDP, I tried the next size up ([Max](https://ablecarry.com/products/max?variant=32104084078705)). I wanted to compare it to something, so I went with the [CPL28](https://evergoods.us/collections/civic-panel-loader-series/products/civic-panel-loader-28l). I've been using the Max for a few days now. The CPL just came in, and I'll carry it around for a few days to confirm, but here are my impressions.\n\n[Front - CPL28 \\(left\\) and Max \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/bkcakeiuhclb1.jpg?width=2815&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4f82d647bb677600c32b220793877df6758a314)\n\n**Able Carry Max - Pros**Much like the Daily Plus, the materials, design, and construction are superb. Every aspect of it appears to be well thought out. The space limitations I observed with the Daily Plus were not apparent with the Max. It stands up on its own (even when empty). The internal water pocket does not appear to eat into the internal dimensions much, as it did with the Daily Plus. The separate compartment (5L) for electronics, with a water resistant zipper, is very nice, and easily stores my Lenovo in the main computer section. The straps are very comfortable, as is the back. The chest strap (magnetic) is particularly nice. The luggage bag pass through in the pack is also a nice add on. There are plenty of loops to attach carabiners to, without looking odd. The two main zippers are lockable, which is a nice feature. The XPac material doesn't pick up lint or dirt easily.\n\n**Able Carry Max - Cons**Much like the Daily Plus, the Max has some compartments that I believe are unusable. There is a small pouch on the top in the back that is too small for anything useful. The laptop section has a spot for your computer, and another large compartment for whatever you want. The section is quite deep, and it's easy to have whatever you want lost in the bottom, particularly if you're planning on putting a tablet or kindle in there. Yet, if you put more than one item in there, they have a tendency of getting bunched up, and you'll feel it in your back when you carry the bag. The front pocket, while nice, is awkward to access (in order to carry the bag comfortably, you need to tighten the straps well, which once tightened puts the front pocket at chin height when you swing it around, at least to me). While it's larger than the Daily Plus, it borders on \"too large\" and may be bulky for some.\n\n**Able Carry Max - Neutral**Unlike the CPL, the front main compartment fully zips down, but isn't quite as easily \"flat\" accessible when it's on it's back. It works more like a traditional, top access backpack, that can be used as a panel bag. That may work for some, and may not for others. The computer section has one side of the zipper that zips further down than the other side, in an attempt to gain access to the bottom of the section easier, which may work well for some and may not for others depending on whether you're right handed or left handed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Back Straps - CPL28 \\(left\\) and Max \\(right\\)](https://preview.redd.it/m3v4c1q8iclb1.jpg?width=2784&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85f1101fd46889f6c26efb31ef40c4e85f582aa4)\n\n**CPL28 - Pros**Despite the straps not being as padded or as comfortable as the Max (below), when you put the bag on the top of the bag where the bag meets the straps almost extends, wrapping your shoulders slightly and making better contact with your back, which makes the bag almost form to your body slightly. It was something I was not expecting, but is quite nice. The computer section is accessible from the side, and can easily house my Lenovo laptop, along with my Macbook Pro, and have everything easy to access and reach. Inside the main compartment is another computer sleeve, giving you the ability to carry up to 3 devices fairly easily. The front pouch is much more well designed than the Max, is easier to access, and can store more items. The design is more boxy than the Max, which from my initial impressions doesn't mean it can store more or less than the Max, but appears to utilize less space than the Max.\n\n**CPL28 - Cons**My initial impression is that the bag is not as well constructed as the Max, and the materials are of lower quality than the Max, although that's just comparing side by side, straight out of the box. Not that the CPL is poorly constructed, or of low quality products, because that's not true. Just in comparison, I believe I was expecting more when I opened the bag (part of that could also be the almost cult like following you read about from the CPL fans). The straps themselves are not as comfortable as the Max, nor is the back panel, and it lacks a luggage pass through. Not being XPac, it pics up dirt and lint VERY easily, having touched the ground and it immediately shows. No water bottle section (internal or external) is certainly a negative to me. There is a top small zippered section on the top of the bag, presumably for keys and quick access items, but it appears almost to be an afterthought to the design, and the bottom is not secured to the bag (just near the top). The design (for what it's worth) is less sleek in comparison to the Max. There are fewer integrations in handles, clips, loops, and secure points, and the zippers are neither waterproof nor lockable.\n\n**CPL28 - Neutral**The bag does not stand up on its own (for me, empty or full), and collapses easily. That may work for some, and may not for others. The CLP (as the name implies) is a true panel loader, meaning you can put the bag on its back and completely open the top and flap it open, giving you access to everything inside. While obviously that's the design, if you want to use it as a traditional backpack, it may be less optimal.\n\n**Overall**I've been very pleased with the Max over the past few days. The size is nice, the materials are nice, it's comfortable and it works for what I need it to. After trying the 20L ACDP and finding it too small, I tried the 30L Max, and I'm finding it is just on the border of too large. I would have preferred something between the two, if Able Carry offered a 25L option, but I'm fine choosing the Max over the ACDP if asked. After carrying the Max for a few days, I was particularly excited to try out the CPL28, as most consider it an \"upgrade\" over the Max. But when the CPL came, I was somewhat disappointed. It could be the hype was more than the bag could ever deliver, but I was not blown away by the design, materials, or feel of the straps and back. It seemed nice, but having tried 4 bags over the past 3 weeks so far, I can't say this one stands out over the rest. And at the higher end of the price point, with a large community following it, I expected it would. Other bags are waterproof, with more integrated features, for less cost. I know the CPL's straps need to be \"broken in\", but with a 30 day return policy (that does not appear very liberal, considering it can't show any wear at all, with original tags still in place) it's tough to tell now how it would feel when it's broken in. If I had gotten the CPL without having seen the Max, I probably would have settled for the CPL, figuring it isn't perfect but it'll do for what I need it to do. But having tried the Max side by side with the CPL, I realize there are a number of features I may have ignored that the CPL doesn't have.\n\nI'd like to at least carry the CPL around for a few days. Maybe I'll learn to love its features more than initial impressions show. But right now, unless it can prove itself, I'm leaning toward the Max.",

But I became reluctant to change the straps once I found that \"sweet spot.\" I'm sure with time and practice I'd get better, but initially I'm not sure I was saving much, if any time doing that over just taking the bag off. Which is what I ended up doing. \n\nThe 840d is nice material. But it picks up dirt, dust and hair quick. It would probably be less noticable if it weren't right next to an XPac bag. \n\nI find it a little frustrating that Evergoods doesn't offer more products in Xpac, and when they do it's for PREMIUM prices compared to their own line and competitors. Then they sell out FAST and Evergoods discontinues production. Seems like customers are telling them what they want, but Evergoods is more interested in jacking up prices on limited release items.",

If I was carrying around the Ardennes and got the CPL, I'd think the CPL is a VASTLY superior product and probably wouldn't have a need to look further. But if you pit the CPL against another bag, the results might be different. If I compared the CPL24 to the Daily Plus, I likely would have went with the CPL24, only because it would hold my items better than the Daily Plus did, even if I liked the features of the Daily Plus.\n\nI've talked to a few people who tried the Max and found it too bulky, settling instead on the CPL or the CTB. Which is why I got both to try out, side by side. I'm glad I did, as I may not have appreciated the Max as well if I didn't have the CPL next to it, or I would have settled on the CPL if the Max wasn't next to it. But your mileage may vary.\n\nIt might be psychological, but I find it hard to overlook the \"extras\" that the Max offers (Xpac, lockable zippers, waterproof zippers, better straps, better chest strap, better back, luggage pass through, water bottle pocket), at a lower price point than the CPL.\n\nIn any event, I hope you enjoy the Max!",

The pocket can hold a good amount of gear, and sits on top of my laptop, if carrying one. \n\nThe worst thing about the ACM for me is definitely the front pocket, which is nearly unusable IMO. I will try to fit a organizer insert from Alpha One Niner to see if I can use it as an admin panel instead, but I would really love if they redesigned it as a horizontal dump-pocket (like on the CTB26) instead.",

The xpac material has no stretch compared to the cordura of the gorucks (I had a GR1) so my only gripe is that the size feels significantly smaller, compared to the GR1 I had that felt much bigger. Both are solid, both are different. Depends on what you like. Able carry is much more sleek modern and minimalist style and excellently executed. Gorucks are robust and overbuilt. Both handle abuse really well",
