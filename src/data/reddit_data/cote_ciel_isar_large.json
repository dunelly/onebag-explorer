It shipped on the 11/01, so pretty happy with the turnaround for my first LTT order. No customs too.\n\n*Shipping updates at the bottom  for those who are interested.*\n\n**The bag has two main problems.**\n\n* They advertise it fits the 16\" MBP, which was very important and this is my work laptop: It fits but also doesn't. The bag would benefit from being 1cm taller. The corner poke out, and make it very much a hassle to make sure the the zips dont chip or scratch the black paint.  I will still use it daily with the 16\" MBP, but this was a letdown.\n* The front facia of the bag also came with some defects, its like a hard plasticy/cardboard material under the repreve that came warped, and you can feel the hard turns (pictured, bottom left of bag). Will be reaching out to support.\n\nApart from that the bags great. Fits my personal 14\" MBP like a treat. Does fit my few things I need. Also ordered a screwdriver. so thats nice. Will update after taking to office a few times in London\n\n**EDIT**\n- A lot of people saying, I should have checked the dimensions. I did. \n\n- LTT explicitly mentioned it would fit the MBP 16, it was mentioned by someone from LTT on another post, and in their youtube video. \n\n- Ultimately, i‚Äôm not a 16‚Äù fan, i much prefer the 14‚Äù. But I commute to my office with my work laptop which is the 16‚Äù. \n- I will be keeping the bag, as i think it‚Äôs really nice aesthetically and not in your face TECH BRO bag. It‚Äôs a much needed replacement for my older 8 year old cheap dickies bag. \n\n- Re. the macbook clearance. meh. it‚Äôs not ideal, it‚Äôs fine. i take it in and out twice a day, and i‚Äôll just be a little more careful, and i can tuck into the inner space before zipping.

It‚Äôs a work laptop, so even if it gets marked, work won‚Äôt care. \n\n- I‚Äôll just submit a ticket, and see what they can do and go about my day\n\n**Order updates:**\n`Shipping details were as follows:`\n`Jan 23, 2025`\n`Delivered`\n`Jan 23, 2025`\n`OUT FOR DELIVERY`\n`09:31 AM GMT, UNITED KINGDOM`\n`ARRIVED AT DELIVERY TERMINAL`\n`02:45 AM GMT, UNITED KINGDOM`\n`Jan 22, 2025`\n`DEPARTED FROM LOCAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER`\n`09:46 PM GMT, UNITED KINGDOM`\n`ARRIVAL AT DESTINATION COUNTRY`\n`07:26 PM GMT, UNITED KINGDOM`\n`Jan 16, 2025`\n`DEPARTED FROM LOCAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER`\n`06:58 PM LT`\n`PROCESSING COMPLETED AT ORIGIN`\n`01:24 PM PT, Whittier, CA, US`\n`PROCESSED`\n`08:34 AM PT, Whittier, CA, US`\n`PACKAGE RECEIVED AT DHL ECOMMERCE DISTRIBUTION CENTER`\n`07:32 AM PT, Whittier, CA, US`\n`Jan 14, 2025`\n`EN ROUTE TO DHL ECOMMERCE DISTRIBUTION CENTER OR AWAITING PROCESSING`\n`01:57 AM PT, Sumner, WA, US`\n`DHL ECOMMERCE CURRENTLY AWAITING SHIPMENT AND TRACKING WILL BE UPDATED WHEN RECEIVED`\n`01:49 AM PT, Sumner, WA, US`\n`Jan 10, 2025`\n`LABEL CREATED`\n`08:15 PM PT, Sumner, WA, US`",

Funnily enough, the bag was originally even smaller. But because we knew this was such a popular laptop, we adjusted the spec to be able to fit this laptop to what at the time felt acceptable to us.¬†Additionally, given standard production variance, it‚Äôs possible that some units will have a bit more or a bit less space. In a situation like this, it's a game of millimeters.\n\nBut to be clear, that doesn‚Äôt excuse how you feel about your laptop‚Äôs fit. Frankly, what we consider as ‚Äúfitting‚Äù should have been much less snug to account for potential variations in manufacturing- especially since we pointed out the 16‚Äù MBP specifically. We‚Äôre going to be looking at our messaging internally to see if we should make any adjustments to how we discuss the commuter and 16\" laptops as a whole on the site because of this.\n\nAs for the warped backpack front, that definitely isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôd like for you to expect when your backpack arrives. You‚Äôve noted that you‚Äôve already reached out to support which is great- we‚Äôll make sure that issue gets solved!\n\nWe appreciate the feedback and are noting not just yours, but all the other reviews that are coming in as people receive their backpacks.",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it.¬†",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it.¬†",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it.¬†",

            "body": "Weird, somehow my comments are not posted together with the pictures. Anyway, here goes...\n\nHi, just received the new Trakke Storr 20L Travel Backpack yesterday. It looks smaller than I thought. I loaded up with my EDC items:\\* Macbook Air 13\\* Airpod &amp; mouse\\* CAP 1 &amp; 2\\* Unilqo packable windbreaker\\* Knirps retractable umbrella\\* Plastic folder with some documents\\* Nalgene 650ml bottle\\* Ziploc pack of wet wipes and dry tissues\n\nHere are my initial thoughts as I only loaded it up but have yet to carry it out (do note the pictures are taken with the bag empty except for the ones with the Macbook and Nalgene bottle positioned for a better look at the sizing):-\n\nMaterials: As I have the GR1 Heritage, the waxed canvas material feels comparable to Heritage waxed duck canvas. It is definitely less harsh on the skin and clothing fabric as compared to Cordura. The straps and buckles are top quality solid finish, I especially like the D-ring strap pulls on the ends of the straps. The round shaped zipper pulls are nice but I personally prefers hypalon type of pulls.\n\nDesign: I like the overall look of the bag, it is quite slick and looks like a cross between Aer Pro Pack and EG PLC20. The external bottle holder design is quite unique, the shoulder straps are anchored on the water bottle external flap thus securing the water bottle against the bag when you carry it. There's an admin panel with a separate sling attached to it that can be removed. This admin panel is quite simple with 2 mesh pocket and a dump pocket that occupies half the front panel. The detachable sling can be used for tech storage if needed.\n\nCapacity: Seems to fill up the bag much more as compared to my other carry - GR1 21L Heritage, Able Carry Daily Plus, Evergoods PLC20 and Bellroy Classic Backpack. I thought it feels much smaller than the stated 20L capacity. Also the cutting and design of the bag contributes to a smallish base in the main compartment. Placing my CAP1 there already took up half the space, I was surprised how small it was, it is probably half the size of the GR1 base. One of the pictures shows my MBA13 in the laptop compartment, you need to move the shoulder strap out of the way to slide in the Macbook and it fit just nicely, any larger won't fit. I think this compartment is not suspended from the floor although the bag material is thick enough to provide some cushion.\n\nCarry: The shoulder straps although thin do feel well padded and comfy enough for long carry, I will revisit this comment again once I have the chance to carry it for a week or so. I do find the strap adjusters are too chunky and the shoulder strap too wide, both cuts into my biceps when I tighten the straps and I am a small frame guy (170m 66kg). That's my current feel as I load it up and walk around the house.\n\nAt this price point and based on initial thoughts, it doesn't seem as comparable to the bags I have (except maybe the Bellroy), will test it out for a while and decide if I keep or liquidate it.¬†",

                "body": "RE: the capacity, little confused. i'm assuming you're putting the cap1l upright? and is the mouse in it? I can only assume its bulging alot?\n\neven my cap2l in the bottom of my chz22 took up nearly the entire base.\n\neven so, the bag does need to break in, and i'm sure the canvas will soon become stretched and roomier as the bag is continually used, as well as the padded straps.",

But I can't seem to find another one with this great compartment or pocket for your stuff. Every other safety pocket I find on backpacks is so flat, so there is no way you could store like sunglasses or other not flat stuff without crushing it. \n\nSo I would be so very grateful if someone could help me find a new backpack with the same type of pocket or compartment so that I can store all my loose stuff without it being easily available for pick-pocketing.",

After people were arguing that /u/inherentlyawesome's [backpack visual guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1jf86y/a_backpack_visual_guide_28_possibilities_to/) [infographic](http://i.imgur.com/FVh4meL.jpg) was focused only on one style of backpack, I decided to work on a companion guide focusing on more city/urban styled packs. /u/inherentlyawesome helped out a bunch on this one, so thanks so much for that! A few other people helped out as well but didn't want to be named. You guys know who you are, thanks for your help!\n\nIt's best not to think of this as a replacement to his guide but rather a brother guide, similar in format but with a different style and different brands (for the most part). So if you're wondering why all these packs seem to be the same (and don't like the style), check out his guide instead!\n\nWithout further ado, the bag links.

            "body": "The full content of the review is below in the reddit post. More pictures of Olive and Midnight Blue Isar M (both fabrics are MemoryTech) can be found at [https://wanderingdots.me/blog/coteampciel-isar-m-review](https://wanderingdots.me/blog/coteampciel-isar-m-review)  \n\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe Isar backpack was provided by Cote&amp;Ciel as a sample for review purposes, the content of this review was not shared with Cote&amp;Ciel before publishing.¬†\n\nMy goal is to share an honest, unbiased review that is not tailored to keep the brand happy.\n\n**FOREWORD**\n\nLet‚Äôs be honest, the bag market has become extremely saturated. The sheer amount of different options released each year is overwhelming - ranging from well-established brands to small workshops and Kickstarter campaigns. In all this abundance of options, it‚Äôs not easy to stand out and offer a unique design and features. Just think about the replicated designs of Jansport or Herschel, it‚Äôs easy to just take a classic design, slap a new brand name, offer a few interesting color or fabric options, and call it a day.\n\nWhat‚Äôs difficult is to forget everything you know and start from a clean slate.\n\nCote&amp;Ciel is a relatively young company founded in Paris by an energetic passionate young team ambitious enough to disrupt the status quo.\n\nIs it hard to find a fashionable bag these days? Not really, with luxury brands like Birkin, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, etc producing hand-made masterpieces that cost a fortune.\n\nWhat about technical bags? Mission Workshop, Black Ember, Peak Design, etc offer some of the most innovative technical fabrics and processes to create their products.\n\nFinding the bag that would be a fashion statement while also being functional and offering innovative sustainable fabrics - well that‚Äôs a challenge that Cote&amp;Ciel was ambitious to tackle.\n\nRead on to find out what resulted in this ambition.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\nFew key features of the bag:\n\n* PRICE RRP $255¬†\n* CAPACITY 21L\n* WEIGHT \\~1.1kg\n* LAPTOP COMPATIBLE up to 16inch\n\nIsar is one of the first bags made by Cote&amp;Ciel and has become a flagship for the brand. The bag has been re-released since 2008 in all kinds of new colors and fabrics (Leather, Denim, MemoryTech, Eco Yarn, etc), a testament of Cote&amp;Ciel constantly revisiting the bag in search of further improvements in both form and function. The bag has a unique standout design, primarily thanks to the large folded front compartment that has become a signature feature and made the Cote&amp;Ciel brand instantly recognizable.¬†\n\nMy review model is Isar in size M (the model also has sizes S and L offered in some fabrics), a relatively large backpack tailored for everyday carry but also capable for short weekend trips. I was fortunate to try the same model in two colors - Midnight Blue and Olive. Both look incredible and reminiscent of nature - the main inspiration for Cote&amp;Ciel.\n\nBoth Midnight Blue and Olive version are made from signature MemoryTech fabric which is very light, yet durable. At the same time, it is very pleasant to the touch, has a bit of scabrous quality to it. A word of warning, if you are a tactile person it might be difficult to get your hands off the bag :) A big advantage of the MemoryTech fabric is excellent water resistance. I tried to get the bag wet and failed miserably - water is repelled and nothing seeping in the fabric.\n\nThe straps, back part of the Isar are made of Cordura which is very durable and water-resistant thanks to DWR coating. Simply put the combination of materials used on the bag is reliable and can withstand the elements without any problem.\n\nWith darker colors (Midnight Blue for instance) the fabric does attract dust more prominently, but a quick splash of water or a touch of wet towel gets the bag as good as new.\n\nFor reference, my measurements are:\n\nHeight 176 cm (5‚Äô8 ft)\n\nWeight 89 kg (195 lbs)\n\nMy EDC:\n\nMacBook Pro 16\n\nCables/Chargers/Dongles\n\nNalgene 32 oz\n\nLunch box\n\nPackable Jacket¬†\n\nKindle Voyage\n\nWallet\n\nKeys\n\nSunglasses\n\n**QUALITY &amp; COMFORT**\n\nThe materials feel high quality, MemoryTech fabric is unlike anything I have tried before and I enjoyed how light and foldable it is.\n\nThe bag features high-quality metal hardware - from subtly branded zipper pulls to a massive compression strap (which is probably overkill but from the design and aesthetics feels right at home). All the hardware on my model has a black finish which is a very nice stealthy touch I appreciate :) In my use of the bag I had no peeling or scratching of the finish which is confidence-inspiring. The trade-off of the high-quality metal hardware - the jingle you get when shaking the bag.\n\nAlso, expanding the bag was not as fast as I had hoped, mainly due to the thick seat-belt like strap not sliding easily through a massive metal buckle. Perhaps this would improve with time either by breaking in the fabric of the strap or developing better motoric :)\n\nThe combination of in-house made fabric and excellent hardware highlights a very high quality of the bag.\n\nThere are no plastic parts anywhere to be found in the bag. A small branded leather tag is also a nice touch.\n\nI was a bit worried at first that Isar would be a classic case of form over function and that with cool looks it would sacrifice in comfort and usability. I was glad to be wrong. Wearing the bag is a pleasant experience, it sits tightly on my back and offers excellent maneuverability when rushing through the crowded streets or public transport.\n\nThe straps have an average thickness and just enough padding to not want more.¬†\n\nThe back panel is flat and also has a decent amount of padding, enough to not feel the laptop stored against the back. I am yet to experience the bag in hot summer conditions and see how the back panel works with perspiration. There is no mesh or air channels to help air circulation which can lead to a sweaty back, definitely something to keep an eye out.\n\nI was a bit underwhelmed by not finding a sternum strap but quickly got over it. I use the sternum strap not so much for the load distribution but more to fix the bag on my back and mitigate the risk of straps realignment. Since the bag sits tightly on me and the straps contour around my shoulders the desire to have a sternum strap was quickly gone. Some iterations of Isar have webbing on the straps that could be used to attach a sternum strap, but such webbing is missing in my model. If you need to have a sternum strap - pay attention to which Isar you are getting.\n\nThe top grab handle is reliable, thick, and nicely padded.",

                "body": "**ORGANIZATION**\n\nIsar consists of two main parts, you can consider one as conservative and the second as innovative.\n\nThe conservative part is the tech organization area placed closer to the back of the bag. Two zippers (quite convenient since you can close the compartment to either left or right side, or even keep both zippers pulls in the middle for quick opening) open up a relatively spacious area which has:\n\n* Suspended, nicely padded laptop sleeve. My newer MacBook Pro 16 fits like a glove\n* Two fairly large mesh pockets excellent for smaller things. The mesh is tight and can securely store small items you don‚Äôt want falling out (AirPods, keys, gum, etc). Mesh is excellent in making the contents of the pockets visible.\n* One zippered compartment. Good for phone, glasses, passport, etc. The zipper provided some security for your valuables.\n\n¬†The opening is also very nice and wide, not a full clamshell but more than a half-zip.\n\nThe innovative part is the aforementioned large folded front compartment. When empty it gives the bag a uniquely stylish silhouette and lays flat making a 21L bag look and feel very compact. The compartment is accessed from a big side zip and allows you to pack Isar to the brim duffle style. The massive compression strap allows to quickly expand the bag offering a lot of capacity to store your things (packing cubes, jacket, water bottle - whatever your heart desires). Inside the front compartment is also a fairly large zippered pocket that can be used for wallet, snacks, whatnot. The big advantage of the from the compartment is that it can accommodate weirdly shaped objects thanks to its flexibility and properties of the MemoryTech fabric.\n\nThe simplicity of the bag is misleading as it offers excellent expandability, good internal organization, and surprising comfort even when fully packed.\n\nI appreciate the minimalistic approach of Isar however one missed opportunity in my books is using all-black color for the inner lining. Both the tech compartment and duffle areas are all black inside which can make finding things difficult in poor lighting conditions. The black liner, however, is not used across the board and there are other models of Isar (made from other fabrics) that have a grey interior which I find more useful.\n\n**WHAT‚ÄôS HOT**\n\n* Unique, iconic design\n* Serious expandability thanks to the folding front compartment\n* Can fit weirdly shaped items¬†\n* Silky smooth zippers with excellent metal hardware¬†\n* Subtle tasteful branding\n* A good amount of organization in the tech compartment\n* Comfortable to carry\n* Solid build quality and choice of materials\n\n**WHAT‚ÄôS NOT**\n\n* The inner lining is all black which makes it difficult to see the content of the bag during some conditions\n* The back panel has no mesh or proper air channel (deep stitching is not sufficient) which can result in a sweaty back during hot days. This is an assumption to be tested later on\n* Expanding the bag via the metal buckle takes more effort than expected¬†\n* Zipper pulls jingle (expected with metal hardware, can be silenced by adding paracord pulls)\n* Certain colors (like Midnight Blue in MemoryTech fabric) are dust magnets, something to keep in mind\n* Can look strange when fully packed, the shape extends outwards\n\n**WRAP-UP**\n\nOverall, despite few minor gripes mentioned above, Cote&amp;Ciel Isar has been a joy to use and I have to say it‚Äôs quirky unusual looks started to grow on me the more I used it.\n\nI have to admit, the iconic design is polarising and not for everyone, but it won‚Äôt leave you indifferent and can complement a more creative, expressive personality. Looks aside, the flexibility of Isar allows it to be an excellent EDC as well as a companion for short trips thanks to the expandable front compartment.¬†¬†\n\nMoreover, the bag will keep your things safe, will be comfortable to wear, and will turn more than a few heads in the process.\n\nIf you are looking for a minimalist yet sophisticated bag that is also tech-friendly - consider Isar as your trusty companion.¬†",

Not sure which material it was exactly, but it's a soft canvas-y type and didn't look particularly reliable long term. I have this weird habit of checking the secondhand marketplace for bags I'm interested in to see the weak points, and that particular material didn't hold up very well.\n\nTheir new material seems a lot better though, so I might give Cote&amp;Ciel another look.",

            "body": "As a graphic designer, Japanese speaker, and techwear enthusiast (lol), I can offer some critique I guess.\n\nFirst of all, your brand identity legit sounds like you are one dude larping as a collective techwear professional service. If you're just one guy with a lot of free time looking at products and reading reviews on the internet, it's fine to be transparent about it. Just make an easy to read, useful infographic. Anybody who has spent a couple months interested in techwear knows every product on here already.\n\nSecond, this japanese is so awkward lmao. style jouhou is a web design term, and is an awkward translation of \"style guide for you\". You don't need a tag line if you're larping a company. Using high tech outside the context of technology, on top of information systems  really makes me think you are just trying to find the most cyberpunky technoorientalist name for this pseudo company.\n\nThird, use of space, shapes, and organization is amateurish. It reminds me of high school prezi presentation. Here you have virtually no useful information beyond the brand, and retail/market prices. While this information is useful at a glance, the real value comes from a short description of the qualities that make it better than other bags in its class.\n\nFourth, the dimensions of this image does not translate well for infographic. You want the image to expand and be viewable in a web browser, so width should be small enough that it will expand and all the user has to do is scroll down. Furthermore, information needs to proceed in a logical left to right, top to bottom order. Here you have some weird net with no clear and consistent organization. The branches come out haphazardly (see B tier), and several items from different subgroups appear on the same level. The coloring scheme is not intuitive, plus the text is extremely hard to read. The font conventions are unclear, heading text have different sizes and formats (S, A then suddenly B tier, C tier).\n\nFifth, you say unknown tier refers to brands that the community doesn't know about, and *lack of products available for review*. This implies that everything else your pseudo company has personally reviewed and researched. You use technical terms such as \"sample sizes\" and \"data analysis\" which seems to suggest that you went through a rigorous quantitative and qualitative evaluation of consumer products. lol. but really it sounds like you just browsed the internet for like 40 minutes then wrote some stuff down and saved some images.  \n\nFinally, this is a clear example of working hard but not working smart. Clearly you put like at least 2 hours on this huge ass PSD, or worse, 4 hours if you're just starting out (in png format to boot, for a heavy text based infographic lol). Do stuff like this if there is value. There has not been a demand for such a type of graphic. The job of a graphic designer working with a consumer researcher is to present the research and results in an easy to digest manner. You want to tell a story about the products. You want to help the viewer understand why these products have been selected, why they are presented this way, and why they should purchase them because of certain pain points in their daily life. For example, somebody's pain points might be they need more space. So you would select a series of bags that have increased carrying capacity. Another could be they want a day to day bag but don't need to carry a laptop. Here are 3 tiers, budget, mid, and high end, of bags that fit this specific need. And so on.\n\nAnyways, in closing, you're one dude, sound like one. Companies nowadays are trying to be more relateable because no one wants to read something as if it was a machine learning algorithm trying to sell you snake oil.\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr**: for anyone else chiming in, we have a wiki I and a few other are working on to hopefully compile a list of useful resources and brandlists related to techwear. https://www.reddit.com/r/techwearclothing/wiki/resources",

There is a S/M which is technically 38 liters, but it wasn't available in store at my REI locations so I went with the 40 liters and figured the extra 2 liters would probably be helpful. So far I have been able to use it as carry on for Southwest, American, Delta, Vueling, EasyJet, Transavia, Volotea and I believe Ryanair. Because airports give me anxiety and turn me into a huge b word, I try my best to avoid having to check anything in.\n\n\n**Organization**: \n\nIn my personal item, I use [mesh pouches](https://www.containerstore.com/s/travel/makeup-toiletries/pink-micro-mesh-pouches/12d?productId=11003926) that I bought from the Container Store. In these I typically store my electronics/cords, medicines (birth control, allergy, sinus, and Imodium).  I normally use whatever wallet I'm currently carrying on an everyday basis and use my [Madewell The Leather Pouch Wallet](https://www.madewell.com/the-leather-pouch-wallet-F6967.html?dwvar_F6967_color=BK5229&amp;dwvar_F6967_size=ONE%20S&amp;cgid=accessories-bags-poucheswallets&amp;position=25&amp;position=25&amp;activeChunk=0#start=1) for coins. I had a cheap passport holder from Target that my mom got me. I just purchased a [Zoppen Passport Wallet](https://www.amazon.com/Zoppen-Passport-Blocking-Multi-purpose-Organizer/dp/B07KN1ZTP6/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3PC20FTNRVY52&amp;keywords=zoppen+multi-purpose+rfid+blocking+travel+passport+wallet&amp;qid=1568479507&amp;sprefix=zoppen%2Caps%2C242&amp;sr=8-3) which I learned about from thataylaa on youtube and I also recently purchase an [Aspinal of London Passport Cover](https://www.aspinaloflondon.com/products/passport-cover-in-bright-pink-saffiano). [This](https://www.containerstore.com/s/travel/makeup-toiletries/blue-avocado-black-zippered-travel-pouch/12d?productId=10034745) is the bag for my liquids. It's held up well over the last year and it's much better than the ziplock method I was doing before.\n\n\nFor my carryon, I use [Eagle Creek Packing Cubes](https://www.rei.com/product/866241/eagle-creek-original-pack-it-cube-set) to organize my clothes in my backpack. I bought several different sizes and use the smaller cubes to organize socks/underwear. Last year I managed to do 2 weeks in Europe with only a carry on bag. I don't have too much of an issue with wrinkling because I try to always stay in airbnbs or hotels that have irons and it doesn't bother me to have to iron things again. And I bring an extra trash bag for dirty clothes.\n\n\nI protect my clothes from my shoes [shoe covers](https://www.amazon.com/YAMIU-Travel-Waterproof-Nylon-Zipper/dp/B01N4B7C9X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3Q26M1KTG79D7&amp;keywords=shoe+covers+for+travel&amp;qid=1568478820&amp;sprefix=shoe+covers%2Caps%2C176&amp;sr=8-2) to protect my shoes from my clothes.\n \nI normally only bring around 4-5 shirts, 2-3 bottoms, maybe 1-2 dresses or skirts and merino wool socks and panties. I've been lucky enough to score airbnbs with washers and I just allow myself enough time to air dry my clothes. I handwash my Smartwool socks and underwear with Dr. Bronners.\n\nI have my eyes on Away luggage but most of the reviews online are sponsored so I feel like it's hard to get honest reviews. I am also kind of looking at Rimowa and Globe Trotter luggage but I would probably cry myself to sleep every night seeing how beat up it would get after being checked in a million times. I was also thinking of getting the [Catalina Deluxe](https://www.loandsons.com/pages/discover-catalina-deluxe-womens-weekender-travel-bag) to use as a carry-on that I can pair with checked luggage. \n\nWhat tips/tricks do you have for packing and organization while traveling?\n\nI don‚Äôt have any good pictures of my carry on but here is a [picture from last year](https://imgur.com/a/1Z2WvpQ).",
