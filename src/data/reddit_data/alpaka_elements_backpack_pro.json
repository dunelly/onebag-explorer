        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to introduce my latest impulse buy owning approximately 0 nice backpacks. I decided \"why not?\" and after alot of research and some recommendations from a work colleague, I decided to jump on the pre-order for the Elements pro backpack, after using some hunk of garbage Nike backpack for longer than time itself.\n\nI'd like to again stress the title. I have no clue what makes a good backpack, just wanted to share my thought on my new backpack, and hopefully give some insight, I might give a carry update after tomorrow and following weeks etc. I haven't even taken it outside yet, just packed it, and upon packing here's my thoughts.\n\nFirst, my god was this expensive. I paid $225 AUD, about $150 USD, I don't know if that's cheap or not but it's something to keep in mind for those on a budget. The price is now $271 or $180 now that it's available for regular purchase.\n\nHOWEVER, wow oh wow am I impressed initially. The backpack is made of 840D ballistic nylon, I don't know what that means, but it feels really nice and sturdy, and probably pretty water resistant on the outside. The zippers are ultra smooth and look pretty water resistant too, and feel satisfying to use. Zip tabs are these sort of split leather stitched sorta vibe ya know, feel very solid and well cut. The shape of the backpack is quite slim and tall which I prefer.\n\nIt has 2 external water bottle holders. I think my bottle is a 750ml, it fits alright but a little snug. It advertises it fits a litre which might be a little tight tbh but I'll probably never try lmao.\n\nOnto the straps and handle, the top D Handle is kind of small but feels solidly built and stitched, so we'll see how I go, the shoulder straps are nicely shaped and have this funky geometric cushioning, from the initial wear it feels very comfortable and well contoured, I'm 6'1 and it felt very comfortable against my back and shoulders, could easily wear this all day just from the initial try on. Magnetic sternum strap feels nice and secure and is easily removable. The adjustments are the classic plastic clasps loop thingos, they feel pretty standard, I don't know why but I feel like I expected metal hardware but that does add weight but again, no clue what to expect in good backpacks.\n\nOnto the inside main pocket, I've got a 14 inch laptop inside a sleeve, 2 notebooks and a pair of WH-1000XM5. Everything comfortably fits and good choice of fabric on the laptop pocket to prevent scratches if I were to not use the sleeve. The whole inside has this white honeycomb lining which feels really nicely textured and very durable. I must also say stitching is perfect, not a loose thread in sight on the whole bag.\n\nNext pocket is glasses pocket, little zipper garage action, nice microfibre material inside so it doesn't scratch glasses, not much to say, great pocket. \n\nNext is what I think is called the admin panel? The sort of seatbelt material is for their HUB accessories but they cost a billion dollars, basically just some stuff to attach like key holders, hand sanitizer etc. But I love the organisation in here, plenty of pocket to hold bits and pieces, I have a calculator, pen, pencil case and wireless mouse in here, all fit perfectly in pockets, again I cannot stress enough, QC on this bag seems fantastic. \n\nRounding it off is the little front pocket under this little flap deal, it's hella small, don't know what to put in there but it's got the same white nylon material.\n\nAlright enough rambling\n\nTL;DR\nThis is great looking, feeling, packable bag, I know nothing about bags, but I feel like I got my money's worth, might update with wearabilty after some time\n\nP.S. this is my first post pls go softly on me",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to introduce my latest impulse buy owning approximately 0 nice backpacks. I decided \"why not?\" and after alot of research and some recommendations from a work colleague, I decided to jump on the pre-order for the Elements pro backpack, after using some hunk of garbage Nike backpack for longer than time itself.\n\nI'd like to again stress the title. I have no clue what makes a good backpack, just wanted to share my thought on my new backpack, and hopefully give some insight, I might give a carry update after tomorrow and following weeks etc. I haven't even taken it outside yet, just packed it, and upon packing here's my thoughts.\n\nFirst, my god was this expensive. I paid $225 AUD, about $150 USD, I don't know if that's cheap or not but it's something to keep in mind for those on a budget. The price is now $271 or $180 now that it's available for regular purchase.\n\nHOWEVER, wow oh wow am I impressed initially. The backpack is made of 840D ballistic nylon, I don't know what that means, but it feels really nice and sturdy, and probably pretty water resistant on the outside. The zippers are ultra smooth and look pretty water resistant too, and feel satisfying to use. Zip tabs are these sort of split leather stitched sorta vibe ya know, feel very solid and well cut. The shape of the backpack is quite slim and tall which I prefer.\n\nIt has 2 external water bottle holders. I think my bottle is a 750ml, it fits alright but a little snug. It advertises it fits a litre which might be a little tight tbh but I'll probably never try lmao.\n\nOnto the straps and handle, the top D Handle is kind of small but feels solidly built and stitched, so we'll see how I go, the shoulder straps are nicely shaped and have this funky geometric cushioning, from the initial wear it feels very comfortable and well contoured, I'm 6'1 and it felt very comfortable against my back and shoulders, could easily wear this all day just from the initial try on. Magnetic sternum strap feels nice and secure and is easily removable. The adjustments are the classic plastic clasps loop thingos, they feel pretty standard, I don't know why but I feel like I expected metal hardware but that does add weight but again, no clue what to expect in good backpacks.\n\nOnto the inside main pocket, I've got a 14 inch laptop inside a sleeve, 2 notebooks and a pair of WH-1000XM5. Everything comfortably fits and good choice of fabric on the laptop pocket to prevent scratches if I were to not use the sleeve. The whole inside has this white honeycomb lining which feels really nicely textured and very durable. I must also say stitching is perfect, not a loose thread in sight on the whole bag.\n\nNext pocket is glasses pocket, little zipper garage action, nice microfibre material inside so it doesn't scratch glasses, not much to say, great pocket. \n\nNext is what I think is called the admin panel? The sort of seatbelt material is for their HUB accessories but they cost a billion dollars, basically just some stuff to attach like key holders, hand sanitizer etc. But I love the organisation in here, plenty of pocket to hold bits and pieces, I have a calculator, pen, pencil case and wireless mouse in here, all fit perfectly in pockets, again I cannot stress enough, QC on this bag seems fantastic. \n\nRounding it off is the little front pocket under this little flap deal, it's hella small, don't know what to put in there but it's got the same white nylon material.\n\nAlright enough rambling\n\nTL;DR\nThis is great looking, feeling, packable bag, I know nothing about bags, but I feel like I got my money's worth, might update with wearabilty after some time\n\nP.S. this is my first post pls go softly on me",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to introduce my latest impulse buy owning approximately 0 nice backpacks. I decided \"why not?\" and after alot of research and some recommendations from a work colleague, I decided to jump on the pre-order for the Elements pro backpack, after using some hunk of garbage Nike backpack for longer than time itself.\n\nI'd like to again stress the title. I have no clue what makes a good backpack, just wanted to share my thought on my new backpack, and hopefully give some insight, I might give a carry update after tomorrow and following weeks etc. I haven't even taken it outside yet, just packed it, and upon packing here's my thoughts.\n\nFirst, my god was this expensive. I paid $225 AUD, about $150 USD, I don't know if that's cheap or not but it's something to keep in mind for those on a budget. The price is now $271 or $180 now that it's available for regular purchase.\n\nHOWEVER, wow oh wow am I impressed initially. The backpack is made of 840D ballistic nylon, I don't know what that means, but it feels really nice and sturdy, and probably pretty water resistant on the outside. The zippers are ultra smooth and look pretty water resistant too, and feel satisfying to use. Zip tabs are these sort of split leather stitched sorta vibe ya know, feel very solid and well cut. The shape of the backpack is quite slim and tall which I prefer.\n\nIt has 2 external water bottle holders. I think my bottle is a 750ml, it fits alright but a little snug. It advertises it fits a litre which might be a little tight tbh but I'll probably never try lmao.\n\nOnto the straps and handle, the top D Handle is kind of small but feels solidly built and stitched, so we'll see how I go, the shoulder straps are nicely shaped and have this funky geometric cushioning, from the initial wear it feels very comfortable and well contoured, I'm 6'1 and it felt very comfortable against my back and shoulders, could easily wear this all day just from the initial try on. Magnetic sternum strap feels nice and secure and is easily removable. The adjustments are the classic plastic clasps loop thingos, they feel pretty standard, I don't know why but I feel like I expected metal hardware but that does add weight but again, no clue what to expect in good backpacks.\n\nOnto the inside main pocket, I've got a 14 inch laptop inside a sleeve, 2 notebooks and a pair of WH-1000XM5. Everything comfortably fits and good choice of fabric on the laptop pocket to prevent scratches if I were to not use the sleeve. The whole inside has this white honeycomb lining which feels really nicely textured and very durable. I must also say stitching is perfect, not a loose thread in sight on the whole bag.\n\nNext pocket is glasses pocket, little zipper garage action, nice microfibre material inside so it doesn't scratch glasses, not much to say, great pocket. \n\nNext is what I think is called the admin panel? The sort of seatbelt material is for their HUB accessories but they cost a billion dollars, basically just some stuff to attach like key holders, hand sanitizer etc. But I love the organisation in here, plenty of pocket to hold bits and pieces, I have a calculator, pen, pencil case and wireless mouse in here, all fit perfectly in pockets, again I cannot stress enough, QC on this bag seems fantastic. \n\nRounding it off is the little front pocket under this little flap deal, it's hella small, don't know what to put in there but it's got the same white nylon material.\n\nAlright enough rambling\n\nTL;DR\nThis is great looking, feeling, packable bag, I know nothing about bags, but I feel like I got my money's worth, might update with wearabilty after some time\n\nP.S. this is my first post pls go softly on me",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to introduce my latest impulse buy owning approximately 0 nice backpacks. I decided \"why not?\" and after alot of research and some recommendations from a work colleague, I decided to jump on the pre-order for the Elements pro backpack, after using some hunk of garbage Nike backpack for longer than time itself.\n\nI'd like to again stress the title. I have no clue what makes a good backpack, just wanted to share my thought on my new backpack, and hopefully give some insight, I might give a carry update after tomorrow and following weeks etc. I haven't even taken it outside yet, just packed it, and upon packing here's my thoughts.\n\nFirst, my god was this expensive. I paid $225 AUD, about $150 USD, I don't know if that's cheap or not but it's something to keep in mind for those on a budget. The price is now $271 or $180 now that it's available for regular purchase.\n\nHOWEVER, wow oh wow am I impressed initially. The backpack is made of 840D ballistic nylon, I don't know what that means, but it feels really nice and sturdy, and probably pretty water resistant on the outside. The zippers are ultra smooth and look pretty water resistant too, and feel satisfying to use. Zip tabs are these sort of split leather stitched sorta vibe ya know, feel very solid and well cut. The shape of the backpack is quite slim and tall which I prefer.\n\nIt has 2 external water bottle holders. I think my bottle is a 750ml, it fits alright but a little snug. It advertises it fits a litre which might be a little tight tbh but I'll probably never try lmao.\n\nOnto the straps and handle, the top D Handle is kind of small but feels solidly built and stitched, so we'll see how I go, the shoulder straps are nicely shaped and have this funky geometric cushioning, from the initial wear it feels very comfortable and well contoured, I'm 6'1 and it felt very comfortable against my back and shoulders, could easily wear this all day just from the initial try on. Magnetic sternum strap feels nice and secure and is easily removable. The adjustments are the classic plastic clasps loop thingos, they feel pretty standard, I don't know why but I feel like I expected metal hardware but that does add weight but again, no clue what to expect in good backpacks.\n\nOnto the inside main pocket, I've got a 14 inch laptop inside a sleeve, 2 notebooks and a pair of WH-1000XM5. Everything comfortably fits and good choice of fabric on the laptop pocket to prevent scratches if I were to not use the sleeve. The whole inside has this white honeycomb lining which feels really nicely textured and very durable. I must also say stitching is perfect, not a loose thread in sight on the whole bag.\n\nNext pocket is glasses pocket, little zipper garage action, nice microfibre material inside so it doesn't scratch glasses, not much to say, great pocket. \n\nNext is what I think is called the admin panel? The sort of seatbelt material is for their HUB accessories but they cost a billion dollars, basically just some stuff to attach like key holders, hand sanitizer etc. But I love the organisation in here, plenty of pocket to hold bits and pieces, I have a calculator, pen, pencil case and wireless mouse in here, all fit perfectly in pockets, again I cannot stress enough, QC on this bag seems fantastic. \n\nRounding it off is the little front pocket under this little flap deal, it's hella small, don't know what to put in there but it's got the same white nylon material.\n\nAlright enough rambling\n\nTL;DR\nThis is great looking, feeling, packable bag, I know nothing about bags, but I feel like I got my money's worth, might update with wearabilty after some time\n\nP.S. this is my first post pls go softly on me",

        "title": "Aer City Pack vs Alpaka Elements Pro thoughts ",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1dj8l8f/aer_city_pack_vs_alpaka_elements_pro_thoughts/",
        "selftext": "I doubt many people make a direct decision between these two bags, but they’re not so different.  Despite the difference in claimed volume (14L vs 26L), they’re very close in size and capacity.  Thought I’d put together a mini review and let you know my thoughts.  \n\nI started with the Alpaka and also ordered the Xpac version of the Elements Pro.  In my opinion, this bag looks better in Axoflux (their fabric option).  This bag definitely isn’t 26L, but I’d say it’s a good 20.  Despite not having a clamshell opening the “bucket” of storage is comparatively large and useful, especially if you use pouches or packing cubes.  This bag has an awesome silhouette and sits very close to the body, tapering from thin to thick as it goes down.  \n\nI ordered the Aer because I saw it was about the same dimensions, just a little thinner.  It actually looks larger and, in my opinion, less sleek than the Alpaka when viewed from the front.  It also looks larger on the back, even when both bags are empty.  Opposite of the Alpaka, it protrudes more at the top then tapers down to thinner at the bottom (kind of a weird look imo) unless fully packed out.  \n\n\nComfort: Aer wins.  The Alpaka straps are thin, but wide, resulting in a comfortable carry.  The Aer has narrower straps but better padding on both the straps and the back.  Like wearing a cloud, lol.  I hope it doesn’t break down too soon.  I will say both need to be cinched up pretty high to get good ergonomics or else they both make a pressure point/line at the bottom on your back.  Aer’s is less noticeable to me.\n\n\nLooks: in my opinion Alpaka wins here, but you decide.  It’s sleeker and looks more professional. \n\n\nFront half pocket:  Aer wins big time.  Not only is the Alpaka smaller, but it’s also thinner and is hard to access due to the flap.  Good for receipts or your phone, or Field Notes, but not good for quick access.  The Aer’s is comparatively quite roomy.\n\n\nFront admin panel:  For me, the Alpaka is better despite being smaller.  The Aer’s is much more roomy and goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you can put large stuff down there, compared to Alpaka’s which only goes down 2” or so past the zipper line.  If you don’t have much to carry though, this could be a benefit.  Also Aer has more slip pockets and two handy large ones near the bottom, but unfortunately it only has one large zippered pocket vs Alpaka’s three smaller ones.  Zip pockets are very desirable for me.  For example when accessing from an airplane seat where you have very little room, the way the zip pockets present themselves right at the top, on both sides, is very useful on the Alpaka.  Have to dig further down on the Aer and it’s one large pocket, so have to dig through the contents as well to find what you need.  \n\nAlso, the liner quality feels higher on the Alpaka.  Aer’s pockets are kind of loose and floppy and use elastic to cinch the tops, while the Alpaka material is thicker and the pockets are sewn tight to the panel with no elastic.  The material deforms to move out of the way, though.  I wish Aer would add a small zip pocket or two near the top of the outside panel of the admin panel, then it would be perfect imho.  The big/floppy slip pockets could be a benefit for larger items but I don’t carry much big stuff in the admin panel.  Alpaka also wastes space with their accessory ecosystem straps.  The compartment seems too small to use the accessories except for the keyring one.\n\n\nMain compartment:  if you have a jam packed front panel, it’s difficult to access the bottom of the main compartment of the Aer, especially with a laptop in preventing the back from deforming outwards.  The Alpaka’s admin panel doesn’t intrude into the bag volume very much much since it stops half way down.  Again the organization panels are tighter and higher quality on the Alpaka.  However I do really appreciate the two pockets in front on the Aer.  Wish Alpaka would add that.  I’d say the Alpaka offers more volume here by quite a bit, but I haven’t stuffed both full with clothing or something.  What really pushes me to the Aer is I can keep all my EDC toiletries in those two front slip pockets vs having to use a pouch with Alpaka, which I hate.  I carry mini/travel sizes of mouthwash, spray deodorant, and spray sunblock.  Could also use those pouches for granola bars.\n\n\nMisc: water bottle pocket on Aer holds a 24oz, Alpaka holds a 32oz.  I prefer the 32oz.  Aer has a side strap, very handy.  Aer’s sunglasses pouch is about 50% larger; a dividing flap in here would be nice to separate phone and glasses since it’s kind of too large for just your glasses.  Both bags stand on their own.  The zippers are larger on Aer, but this isn’t necessarily a benefit imo.  Both bags fail with the luggage pass through being sideways (hate this for airport use).\n\n\nOverall I’d say if you’re not a pouch guy and don’t plan to carry large items, get the Aer.  The Alpaka offers a cavernous main compartment that holds its shape well, but no organization in the ere besides the laptop and doc sleeve.  The Alpaka has a smaller admin panel, but the 3 zip pockets are great for me.  \n\n\nI think I’m keeping the Aer but the Alpaka is still at the ready.  I don’t want to use pouches which is pushing me to the Aer.  I would take the Alpaka out if I needed to carry lunch, a big jacket, etc.  both would work for that with no laptop, though.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

        "selftext": "I doubt many people make a direct decision between these two bags, but they’re not so different.  Despite the difference in claimed volume (14L vs 26L), they’re very close in size and capacity.  Thought I’d put together a mini review and let you know my thoughts.  \n\nI started with the Alpaka and also ordered the Xpac version of the Elements Pro.  In my opinion, this bag looks better in Axoflux (their fabric option).  This bag definitely isn’t 26L, but I’d say it’s a good 20.  Despite not having a clamshell opening the “bucket” of storage is comparatively large and useful, especially if you use pouches or packing cubes.  This bag has an awesome silhouette and sits very close to the body, tapering from thin to thick as it goes down.  \n\nI ordered the Aer because I saw it was about the same dimensions, just a little thinner.  It actually looks larger and, in my opinion, less sleek than the Alpaka when viewed from the front.  It also looks larger on the back, even when both bags are empty.  Opposite of the Alpaka, it protrudes more at the top then tapers down to thinner at the bottom (kind of a weird look imo) unless fully packed out.  \n\n\nComfort: Aer wins.  The Alpaka straps are thin, but wide, resulting in a comfortable carry.  The Aer has narrower straps but better padding on both the straps and the back.  Like wearing a cloud, lol.  I hope it doesn’t break down too soon.  I will say both need to be cinched up pretty high to get good ergonomics or else they both make a pressure point/line at the bottom on your back.  Aer’s is less noticeable to me.\n\n\nLooks: in my opinion Alpaka wins here, but you decide.  It’s sleeker and looks more professional. \n\n\nFront half pocket:  Aer wins big time.  Not only is the Alpaka smaller, but it’s also thinner and is hard to access due to the flap.  Good for receipts or your phone, or Field Notes, but not good for quick access.  The Aer’s is comparatively quite roomy.\n\n\nFront admin panel:  For me, the Alpaka is better despite being smaller.  The Aer’s is much more roomy and goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you can put large stuff down there, compared to Alpaka’s which only goes down 2” or so past the zipper line.  If you don’t have much to carry though, this could be a benefit.  Also Aer has more slip pockets and two handy large ones near the bottom, but unfortunately it only has one large zippered pocket vs Alpaka’s three smaller ones.  Zip pockets are very desirable for me.  For example when accessing from an airplane seat where you have very little room, the way the zip pockets present themselves right at the top, on both sides, is very useful on the Alpaka.  Have to dig further down on the Aer and it’s one large pocket, so have to dig through the contents as well to find what you need.  \n\nAlso, the liner quality feels higher on the Alpaka.  Aer’s pockets are kind of loose and floppy and use elastic to cinch the tops, while the Alpaka material is thicker and the pockets are sewn tight to the panel with no elastic.  The material deforms to move out of the way, though.  I wish Aer would add a small zip pocket or two near the top of the outside panel of the admin panel, then it would be perfect imho.  The big/floppy slip pockets could be a benefit for larger items but I don’t carry much big stuff in the admin panel.  Alpaka also wastes space with their accessory ecosystem straps.  The compartment seems too small to use the accessories except for the keyring one.\n\n\nMain compartment:  if you have a jam packed front panel, it’s difficult to access the bottom of the main compartment of the Aer, especially with a laptop in preventing the back from deforming outwards.  The Alpaka’s admin panel doesn’t intrude into the bag volume very much much since it stops half way down.  Again the organization panels are tighter and higher quality on the Alpaka.  However I do really appreciate the two pockets in front on the Aer.  Wish Alpaka would add that.  I’d say the Alpaka offers more volume here by quite a bit, but I haven’t stuffed both full with clothing or something.  What really pushes me to the Aer is I can keep all my EDC toiletries in those two front slip pockets vs having to use a pouch with Alpaka, which I hate.  I carry mini/travel sizes of mouthwash, spray deodorant, and spray sunblock.  Could also use those pouches for granola bars.\n\n\nMisc: water bottle pocket on Aer holds a 24oz, Alpaka holds a 32oz.  I prefer the 32oz.  Aer has a side strap, very handy.  Aer’s sunglasses pouch is about 50% larger; a dividing flap in here would be nice to separate phone and glasses since it’s kind of too large for just your glasses.  Both bags stand on their own.  The zippers are larger on Aer, but this isn’t necessarily a benefit imo.  Both bags fail with the luggage pass through being sideways (hate this for airport use).\n\n\nOverall I’d say if you’re not a pouch guy and don’t plan to carry large items, get the Aer.  The Alpaka offers a cavernous main compartment that holds its shape well, but no organization in the ere besides the laptop and doc sleeve.  The Alpaka has a smaller admin panel, but the 3 zip pockets are great for me.  \n\n\nI think I’m keeping the Aer but the Alpaka is still at the ready.  I don’t want to use pouches which is pushing me to the Aer.  I would take the Alpaka out if I needed to carry lunch, a big jacket, etc.  both would work for that with no laptop, though.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

For example when accessing from an airplane seat where you have very little room, the way the zip pockets present themselves right at the top, on both sides, is very useful on the Alpaka.  Have to dig further down on the Aer and it’s one large pocket, so have to dig through the contents as well to find what you need.  \n\nAlso, the liner quality feels higher on the Alpaka.  Aer’s pockets are kind of loose and floppy and use elastic to cinch the tops, while the Alpaka material is thicker and the pockets are sewn tight to the panel with no elastic.  The material deforms to move out of the way, though.  I wish Aer would add a small zip pocket or two near the top of the outside panel of the admin panel, then it would be perfect imho.  The big/floppy slip pockets could be a benefit for larger items but I don’t carry much big stuff in the admin panel.  Alpaka also wastes space with their accessory ecosystem straps.  The compartment seems too small to use the accessories except for the keyring one.\n\n\nMain compartment:  if you have a jam packed front panel, it’s difficult to access the bottom of the main compartment of the Aer, especially with a laptop in preventing the back from deforming outwards.  The Alpaka’s admin panel doesn’t intrude into the bag volume very much much since it stops half way down.  Again the organization panels are tighter and higher quality on the Alpaka.  However I do really appreciate the two pockets in front on the Aer.  Wish Alpaka would add that.  I’d say the Alpaka offers more volume here by quite a bit, but I haven’t stuffed both full with clothing or something.  What really pushes me to the Aer is I can keep all my EDC toiletries in those two front slip pockets vs having to use a pouch with Alpaka, which I hate.  I carry mini/travel sizes of mouthwash, spray deodorant, and spray sunblock.  Could also use those pouches for granola bars.\n\n\nMisc: water bottle pocket on Aer holds a 24oz, Alpaka holds a 32oz.  I prefer the 32oz.  Aer has a side strap, very handy.  Aer’s sunglasses pouch is about 50% larger; a dividing flap in here would be nice to separate phone and glasses since it’s kind of too large for just your glasses.  Both bags stand on their own.  The zippers are larger on Aer, but this isn’t necessarily a benefit imo.  Both bags fail with the luggage pass through being sideways (hate this for airport use).\n\n\nOverall I’d say if you’re not a pouch guy and don’t plan to carry large items, get the Aer.  The Alpaka offers a cavernous main compartment that holds its shape well, but no organization in the ere besides the laptop and doc sleeve.  The Alpaka has a smaller admin panel, but the 3 zip pockets are great for me.  \n\n\nI think I’m keeping the Aer but the Alpaka is still at the ready.  I don’t want to use pouches which is pushing me to the Aer.  I would take the Alpaka out if I needed to carry lunch, a big jacket, etc.  both would work for that with no laptop, though.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

        "selftext": "I doubt many people make a direct decision between these two bags, but they’re not so different.  Despite the difference in claimed volume (14L vs 26L), they’re very close in size and capacity.  Thought I’d put together a mini review and let you know my thoughts.  \n\nI started with the Alpaka and also ordered the Xpac version of the Elements Pro.  In my opinion, this bag looks better in Axoflux (their fabric option).  This bag definitely isn’t 26L, but I’d say it’s a good 20.  Despite not having a clamshell opening the “bucket” of storage is comparatively large and useful, especially if you use pouches or packing cubes.  This bag has an awesome silhouette and sits very close to the body, tapering from thin to thick as it goes down.  \n\nI ordered the Aer because I saw it was about the same dimensions, just a little thinner.  It actually looks larger and, in my opinion, less sleek than the Alpaka when viewed from the front.  It also looks larger on the back, even when both bags are empty.  Opposite of the Alpaka, it protrudes more at the top then tapers down to thinner at the bottom (kind of a weird look imo) unless fully packed out.  \n\n\nComfort: Aer wins.  The Alpaka straps are thin, but wide, resulting in a comfortable carry.  The Aer has narrower straps but better padding on both the straps and the back.  Like wearing a cloud, lol.  I hope it doesn’t break down too soon.  I will say both need to be cinched up pretty high to get good ergonomics or else they both make a pressure point/line at the bottom on your back.  Aer’s is less noticeable to me.\n\n\nLooks: in my opinion Alpaka wins here, but you decide.  It’s sleeker and looks more professional. \n\n\nFront half pocket:  Aer wins big time.  Not only is the Alpaka smaller, but it’s also thinner and is hard to access due to the flap.  Good for receipts or your phone, or Field Notes, but not good for quick access.  The Aer’s is comparatively quite roomy.\n\n\nFront admin panel:  For me, the Alpaka is better despite being smaller.  The Aer’s is much more roomy and goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you can put large stuff down there, compared to Alpaka’s which only goes down 2” or so past the zipper line.  If you don’t have much to carry though, this could be a benefit.  Also Aer has more slip pockets and two handy large ones near the bottom, but unfortunately it only has one large zippered pocket vs Alpaka’s three smaller ones.

        "title": "Aer City Pack vs Alpaka Elements Pro thoughts ",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1dj8l8f/aer_city_pack_vs_alpaka_elements_pro_thoughts/",
        "selftext": "I doubt many people make a direct decision between these two bags, but they’re not so different.  Despite the difference in claimed volume (14L vs 26L), they’re very close in size and capacity.  Thought I’d put together a mini review and let you know my thoughts.  \n\nI started with the Alpaka and also ordered the Xpac version of the Elements Pro.  In my opinion, this bag looks better in Axoflux (their fabric option).  This bag definitely isn’t 26L, but I’d say it’s a good 20.  Despite not having a clamshell opening the “bucket” of storage is comparatively large and useful, especially if you use pouches or packing cubes.  This bag has an awesome silhouette and sits very close to the body, tapering from thin to thick as it goes down.  \n\nI ordered the Aer because I saw it was about the same dimensions, just a little thinner.  It actually looks larger and, in my opinion, less sleek than the Alpaka when viewed from the front.  It also looks larger on the back, even when both bags are empty.  Opposite of the Alpaka, it protrudes more at the top then tapers down to thinner at the bottom (kind of a weird look imo) unless fully packed out.  \n\n\nComfort: Aer wins.  The Alpaka straps are thin, but wide, resulting in a comfortable carry.  The Aer has narrower straps but better padding on both the straps and the back.  Like wearing a cloud, lol.  I hope it doesn’t break down too soon.  I will say both need to be cinched up pretty high to get good ergonomics or else they both make a pressure point/line at the bottom on your back.  Aer’s is less noticeable to me.\n\n\nLooks: in my opinion Alpaka wins here, but you decide.  It’s sleeker and looks more professional. \n\n\nFront half pocket:  Aer wins big time.  Not only is the Alpaka smaller, but it’s also thinner and is hard to access due to the flap.  Good for receipts or your phone, or Field Notes, but not good for quick access.  The Aer’s is comparatively quite roomy.\n\n\nFront admin panel:  For me, the Alpaka is better despite being smaller.  The Aer’s is much more roomy and goes all the way to the bottom of the bag, so you can put large stuff down there, compared to Alpaka’s which only goes down 2” or so past the zipper line.  If you don’t have much to carry though, this could be a benefit.  Also Aer has more slip pockets and two handy large ones near the bottom, but unfortunately it only has one large zippered pocket vs Alpaka’s three smaller ones.  Zip pockets are very desirable for me.  For example when accessing from an airplane seat where you have very little room, the way the zip pockets present themselves right at the top, on both sides, is very useful on the Alpaka.  Have to dig further down on the Aer and it’s one large pocket, so have to dig through the contents as well to find what you need.  \n\nAlso, the liner quality feels higher on the Alpaka.  Aer’s pockets are kind of loose and floppy and use elastic to cinch the tops, while the Alpaka material is thicker and the pockets are sewn tight to the panel with no elastic.  The material deforms to move out of the way, though.  I wish Aer would add a small zip pocket or two near the top of the outside panel of the admin panel, then it would be perfect imho.  The big/floppy slip pockets could be a benefit for larger items but I don’t carry much big stuff in the admin panel.  Alpaka also wastes space with their accessory ecosystem straps.  The compartment seems too small to use the accessories except for the keyring one.\n\n\nMain compartment:  if you have a jam packed front panel, it’s difficult to access the bottom of the main compartment of the Aer, especially with a laptop in preventing the back from deforming outwards.  The Alpaka’s admin panel doesn’t intrude into the bag volume very much much since it stops half way down.  Again the organization panels are tighter and higher quality on the Alpaka.  However I do really appreciate the two pockets in front on the Aer.  Wish Alpaka would add that.  I’d say the Alpaka offers more volume here by quite a bit, but I haven’t stuffed both full with clothing or something.  What really pushes me to the Aer is I can keep all my EDC toiletries in those two front slip pockets vs having to use a pouch with Alpaka, which I hate.  I carry mini/travel sizes of mouthwash, spray deodorant, and spray sunblock.  Could also use those pouches for granola bars.\n\n\nMisc: water bottle pocket on Aer holds a 24oz, Alpaka holds a 32oz.  I prefer the 32oz.  Aer has a side strap, very handy.  Aer’s sunglasses pouch is about 50% larger; a dividing flap in here would be nice to separate phone and glasses since it’s kind of too large for just your glasses.  Both bags stand on their own.  The zippers are larger on Aer, but this isn’t necessarily a benefit imo.  Both bags fail with the luggage pass through being sideways (hate this for airport use).\n\n\nOverall I’d say if you’re not a pouch guy and don’t plan to carry large items, get the Aer.  The Alpaka offers a cavernous main compartment that holds its shape well, but no organization in the ere besides the laptop and doc sleeve.  The Alpaka has a smaller admin panel, but the 3 zip pockets are great for me.  \n\n\nI think I’m keeping the Aer but the Alpaka is still at the ready.  I don’t want to use pouches which is pushing me to the Aer.  I would take the Alpaka out if I needed to carry lunch, a big jacket, etc.  both would work for that with no laptop, though.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any questions!\n",

Naturally, I lined them up side by side for a quick visual comparison.\n\nWhile I haven’t put it through its paces yet, at first glance, it feels like the perfect blend of the Aer CP and the Evergoods CPL24 Mirror.

Plus, I really wanted the hidden side pocket (with the key leash from the CPP) to be on the other side, as I usually swing my bag over my right shoulder. The Metro Pro does just that. And unlike the bulky, boxy feel of the CPP, this one has a sleek profile, especially when it's not packed full. The rounded top also makes it feel less like you’re lugging a mini fridge on your back — sorry, Aer.\n\nNow, for the downsides. The hood that covers the main zip can get in the way. It doesn’t jam the zip, but it does make accessing the main compartment a bit slower, sometimes turning into a two-handed job.\n\nAnother small issue — this might be personal and could be resolved with use— but there's a weird crease on the front panel. I find myself adjusting it by pushing the fabric from inside the front admin pocket. Not sure if it's from being tightly packed during shipping or a design quirk due to the folded stitching on the top left.\n\nThat's it for now.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1d7z3ql/deciding_between_alpaka_elements_pro_axoflux_vs/",
        "selftext": "So I purchased and received both of these in the Elements Backpack Pro.  I really like the backpack design, it’ll be my first “nice” backpack, but now I need to decide which one to send back.  I know there’s a fee to return and I’m OK with that.  \n\nWanted to throw up a few pictures for anyone in the future with the same dilemma, and also try to get some thoughts from the community with more experience.  \n\nI’m split 50/50.  They’re both nice in their own way, so hoping someone has experience with durability.  How will both of these look after being slid under an airplane seat 300 or 400 times?  Accidentally scuffed against door frames?  The bottom of the bag is the same material, so that’s a concern too after years of setting it down or sliding it a little on concrete picking it up.  \n\nMy use case is daily office use, work travel as my personal item, and family vacations/outings.  I’m not concerned with rain resistance, hiking, or more extreme use cases like that.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n-Axoflux looks more professional, Xpac looks more adventurous\n-The xpac is indeed loud/crinkly (does this break in or calm down?).  Not a huge deal, just not used to it\n-Xpac has a shine to it.  Axoflux is matte.  \n-Weight difference is nearly imperceptible.  Maybe slight edge to Xpac.  Certainly will never be noticeable with anything in it.  \n-I have no personal preference on the interior color.  I’d say the white actually provides more visibility (it’s lighter inside).  But if you have a lot of white items I could see the orange being better.  \n-Do these liners stain easily, or wipe clean?  May push me towards orange if it stains.\n\nI think I’m leaning towards the Axoflux, although I’d probably pick the Xpac if I were traveling the world.  It’s mainly the shine and crinkly look turning me off, gives it gym bag vibes.  I think X50 would be perfect for me, but alas it’s not offered (and not gonna pay $400 for an Alpha One 1.0X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I really like the backpack design, it’ll be my first “nice” backpack, but now I need to decide which one to send back.  I know there’s a fee to return and I’m OK with that.  \n\nWanted to throw up a few pictures for anyone in the future with the same dilemma, and also try to get some thoughts from the community with more experience.  \n\nI’m split 50/50.  They’re both nice in their own way, so hoping someone has experience with durability.  How will both of these look after being slid under an airplane seat 300 or 400 times?  Accidentally scuffed against door frames?  The bottom of the bag is the same material, so that’s a concern too after years of setting it down or sliding it a little on concrete picking it up.  \n\nMy use case is daily office use, work travel as my personal item, and family vacations/outings.  I’m not concerned with rain resistance, hiking, or more extreme use cases like that.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n-Axoflux looks more professional, Xpac looks more adventurous\n-The xpac is indeed loud/crinkly (does this break in or calm down?).  Not a huge deal, just not used to it\n-Xpac has a shine to it.  Axoflux is matte.  \n-Weight difference is nearly imperceptible.  Maybe slight edge to Xpac.  Certainly will never be noticeable with anything in it.  \n-I have no personal preference on the interior color.  I’d say the white actually provides more visibility (it’s lighter inside).  But if you have a lot of white items I could see the orange being better.  \n-Do these liners stain easily, or wipe clean?  May push me towards orange if it stains.\n\nI think I’m leaning towards the Axoflux, although I’d probably pick the Xpac if I were traveling the world.  It’s mainly the shine and crinkly look turning me off, gives it gym bag vibes.  I think X50 would be perfect for me, but alas it’s not offered (and not gonna pay $400 for an Alpha One 1.0X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "For a long time I agonised over a number of bags but finally pulled the trigger on this and took it on a four week trip to Europe last year. Here are some thoughts. \n\nWEIGHT\nBag: 1670g\nHip Belt: 320g\nBottom Straps: 27g x 2 = 54g \nTotal of empty bag with hip belt and straps: 2044g \n\nMATERIALS\nI love the aesthetic of this bag and the materials used are great. No issues with zippers and felt comfortable placing the bag down on any surfaces as the ballistic nylon felt like it would stand up to any abrasion. The only downside was the magnet on the chest strap fell out within 2 minutes of first unpacking the bag from Alpaka. I superglued it back into place. \n\nCARRY SYSTEM\nThe shoulder straps were fine position-wise but the awesome looking geometric material is not actually that soft. I would forego the cool aesthetic in favour of a plainer but more comfortable mesh / gel shoulder straps here. \n\nHip belt pockets are a great addition, but I found these too small / tight to fit anything much more than a chap stick or a few coins. I opted to leave the hip belt at home to save the weight. \n\nMy total outbound weight was under 7kg but once I picked up a few items on the trip I really started to feel the weight in my shoulders after carrying the bag for anything more than 5-10 minutes duration. I started to daydream about the hip belt. I get it, it’s not a hiking pack, but it’s also not super comfortable in my experience (even with the help of the chest strap). \n\nSIZE\nThis has been a dealbreaker for some and probably came close for me. I had read prior to purchase that this bag ran small, and that held true for my experience also. I’m looking forward to a certain YouTubers peanut packing volume test when they get round to testing this bag. I cannot fathom how it has 35L capacity, even allowing for water bottle pockets etc. \n\nThe base of the main compartment seems decent, but the design of the bag means that the main compartment tapers towards the top of the bag. I found this really restricted how much you could fit in. The nylon has next to no stretch.\n\nMISC\nWater bottle pocket. This was tight when the bag was full and could scarcely fit a budget 375ml plastic bottle (think Voss water bottle but plastic). \n\nSunglasses/extra admin pocket on side. I did not find it useful. There’s already a tonne of organisation in the front panel and the sunglasses pocket is not lined with soft material so I didn’t trust it.\n\nTLDR\nI love the aesthetic of the bag but it seems small and the organisation is overkill even for me (a lover of as many pockets as possible). After typing this out it seems very critical but I do actually still really like the bag overall. Some points for improvement I guess.",

It was quite bulky but manageable and I never felt any discomfort walking with it on for sometimes up to 12+ hours.\n\nI don't think I'd take it again on vacation and thats honestly why I bought the backpack, so I can fit a few more things in it like a hoodie, water bottle, etc.\n\nThe caveat with the laptop is, it only fits up to a 14 inch as listed on the site, and they really do mean a 14 inch is the max. You won't be able to anything bigger, since it was a tight but great fit for the Macbook 14.\n\nBut if your laptop is a 14 inch or smaller, and you wanna carry that along with a iPad, from my experience with all the stuff I've had, there should be enough space.
