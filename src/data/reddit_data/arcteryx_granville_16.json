                "body": "I regularly rotate between them. The Mantis is much lighter, and has more attachment points on the outside. Overall it probably makes a better bag for day hikes and EDC, but the MPL22 can easily be used as a weekender or small travel bag, while the Mantis probably not. However, removing the framesheet from the Mantis, makes it a great packable bag. Also, i prefer the lighter shade of grey of the Mantis for increased visibility.\nHope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions",

I wanted something just big enough to fit my MacBook Air 13, Bose QC headphones, notepad, pen, a few snacks and a lightweight pullover. I'm tall and have big feet so I wanted something that left more room for me to extend my feet under the seat. This seemed like a good option and was on sale when I bought it. I really like it. Well made, light and not bulky at all. Very comfortable as well. The one criticism I've got so far is that the pocket on the front, the lower, horizontal one, should have the zipper going left to right, not right to left. When I have the bag on its side, the other front pocket (normally vertical) is now horizontal and easy to access, but now the zipper on the lower pocket opens from bottom to top. So you have to be careful nothing falls out if you open it. I'm working around this by not putting anything in the bottom pocket I might want on the plane. Certainly not a deal killer but something to be aware of. Otherwise, for the price I paid, it's an excellent bag.",

I wanted something just big enough to fit my MacBook Air 13, Bose QC headphones, notepad, pen, a few snacks and a lightweight pullover. I'm tall and have big feet so I wanted something that left more room for me to extend my feet under the seat. This seemed like a good option and was on sale when I bought it. I really like it. Well made, light and not bulky at all. Very comfortable as well. The one criticism I've got so far is that the pocket on the front, the lower, horizontal one, should have the zipper going left to right, not right to left. When I have the bag on its side, the other front pocket (normally vertical) is now horizontal and easy to access, but now the zipper on the lower pocket opens from bottom to top. So you have to be careful nothing falls out if you open it. I'm working around this by not putting anything in the bottom pocket I might want on the plane.

            "body": "First impressions are extremely positive!  It really does have a Nomin-like feel to it and the immediate hyperbolic question that comes to mind is: Does the Granville Zip 16 make the Nomin obsolete given price/feature/design differences?  Obviously not completely...but it makes things much more interesting!\n\nQuick Notes:\n\n\\- The inner side of the backpack straps are the same material as what they've been using recently on their Brize and Bora packs (also likely the same that Alpha 31 uses).  Thickness of the foam is about on par with the Brize 25 (which I like and is definitely more on the cushy side than normal packs)\n\n\\-I already like the pocket/organization more than the Nomin V2.  What's interesting and I'm not sure if it will add any value for me yet, is the fact that the pocket at the front/bottom space of the pack has zipper access from the front side and you can also access via zipper from the inside main section where the laptop is housed.\n\n\\-Seam sealing and overall construction is top notch, as expected from an Arc product.  Having an EDC that is nearly waterproof without need for rain cover etc. is one of my major selection points.\n\n\\-The bag itself feels a lot more like the Nomin V1 (but with a quick access pocket in the top front) more than it does the V2.\n\n\\-Pilot gray color with black accents looks sleek!\n\n\\-For around $200 shipped from Canada, I think this is going to win over a lot of people for their EDC\n\n\\-I haven't packed it up yet to see how it carries, so maybe all the excitement is for naught if it carries like shit...more to come!\n\nAdditional Insights:\n\n\\-Tried the pack on and it carries well.  Nomin V2 is more comfortable due to different/wider straps.  The straps are actually narrower than most other Arc'teryx bags in their mainline but still carries comfortably.  \n\n\\-Logo on the front is reflective and I'm not sure but I believe the zipper pulls are new.  I like them, they have design at the end of them to help easily catch your finger on them.  100% better than CPL 24 zipper pulls, probably slightly better grab and pull than Nomin's (though perhaps less stylish depending on what floats your boat).\n\n\\-Top grab handle is kind of a combination of Nomin V1 + V2 with slightly more foam to it, I like it a lot.  Much, much beefier than Arc'teryx Brize grab handle.\n\n\\-The fact that we are comparing this to the Nomin $225 vs. $800 retail says a lot.  In the end, the pocket design and organization , IMO, is better on this bag.  All the straps and materials used for laptop compartment are clearly superior on the Nomin.  The overall footprint/silhouette of this bag is probably 65% of the Nomin V2.\n\nMore Photos:\n\n[On Body](https://imgur.com/KkRaEQL)\n\n[Clean Front of Pack](https://imgur.com/JkllF2a)\n\n[Front Side Pocket with Tumi Cable Organizer Inside](https://imgur.com/KOsSkv7)\n\n[Right Side of Pack](https://imgur.com/d6B9VAe)\n\n[Left Side of Pack (Logo Reflective + New Zipper Pulls)](https://imgur.com/Sef6Pob)\n\n[Main Compartment w/Full Packing Cube at Bottom](https://imgur.com/H6Aaa29)\n\n[Straps/Inner Backside](https://imgur.com/2kiSZ2F)\n\n[Pockets Looking In from Front Side Pocket](https://imgur.com/WmdbXBg)\n\n[Top Front Quick Access Pocket w/Apple Pencil for Attempt at Depth Reference](https://imgur.com/C58JNS0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: Added more pics and additional insights.

The Granville isn't terrible, but it's not a very comfortable carry under heavier loads either. \n\nThe Granville wins in terms of space usage. The two bags in the pictures have similar loads. Surprisingly, the Nomin feels pretty tightly packed whereas the Granville still has space in its front pocket. The Nomin's two pockets seem like a good size, but can't fit much in reality. \n\nOverall, both bags have their strengths and weaknesses. The Nomin has hands down the most comfortable straps I've ever used, but the space is very inefficient for its size. The Granville is smaller and fits a surprisingly amount, but its straps really let it down. \n\nWould be nice if they made something Granville sized but with the Nomin's straps. Anyone have any feedback from the Rofmia Daypack and if that fits the bill?",

Got rid of the really useful smaller pocket up front and added mesh backing. Not sure I love that. I actually use the smaller front pocket a ton if for nothing else than a water bottle. This now essentially has no water bottle holder unless you use the main compartment, which I hate to do. \n\nQuestion for anyone with Aerios backpack experience: is that back mesh abrasive on clothing? I saw the Aerios in store and didn't buy it partly because of that mesh. Seems like it'd tear up Atom fabric.",

Decided to also pack for the winters as I plan to start in Japan first, traversing through Asia then Europe (east to west basically).\n\nWhen I weighed myself with the pack it was a total of 10.8lbs/4.9kg. This is a preliminary pack list and will be change. I still need to add some small things to my toiletries (suncreen, hair product, shaving kit) and the clothes that I packed will probably change as I took whatever was in my closet.\n\n[Interior loadout.](https://i.imgur.com/0TqzkGt.jpeg)\n\n[Full album here.](https://imgur.com/a/ckzB1dr)\n\n[LighterPack list](https://lighterpack.com/r/e5x908)\n\nI'll be taking a 30L ULA Dragonfly as my primary bag, while using an Aer city sling/peak design tote as daily bags when going around.\n\nPacking List (as of right now): \n\n[On/In the bag:](https://i.imgur.com/AZCqiGS.jpeg)\n\n- Airtag\n\n- Heroclip\n\n- Anker nano usb-c charger\n\n- Bedrock Cairn Pros\n\nToiletries - Minigo bag\n\n- Travel lotion, shampoo, conditioner (will buy more locally when running low)\n\n- Travel size cologne\n\n- Toothbrush + toothpaste\n\n[Clothing](https://i.imgur.com/N2s01kE.jpeg) \n\n- 4 pairs of t-shirts, underwear, socks\n\n- 1 pair of shorts\n\n- Atom LT jacket\n\n- Beta LT\n\n- Planning to wear one pair of pants on the flight\n\n[Aer City Sling](https://i.imgur.com/GDFktUy.jpeg)\n\n- X100V\n\n- Peak Design packable tote\n\n- Passport, Field Notes, international driver's license\n\n- Tactile Turn pen\n\n- Wallet\n\n\nThings that I plan to add/change:\n\n- Merino/bamboo socks\n\n- Emergency kit? Can buy medicine locally, then store in my bag\n\n- Titanium spoon/spork\n\n- Adding more to toiletries, shave kit (blades soap), sunscreen, and can buy them locally \n\n- Will definitely be buying more clothes in Japan\n\n- Tablet for entertainment (most likely won't be bringing as it's too big, bulky, weighs 1kg)\n\n- Climbing shoes (most likely won't be bringing as I already have a pair of sandals, will have to rely on rentals when visiting gyms)\n\nFor souvenirs, I'm planning to ship things back or with my friends as they will be traveling with me at the start for 3 weeks. I'm expecting my bag to weigh closer to the 7kg/15lbs limit once I start buying things. Is there anything else that I should add or am missing?",
