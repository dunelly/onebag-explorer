I tend to use the HM if got the wife and kids with me as it normally means that I need to take more crap! If I am on my own or we are just popping out and don’t need to take snacks etc, then normally go for the FM.\n- The HM is slightly more comfortable when fully loaded, as the ‘wing’ attaching the strap to main body of bag is bigger.\n- The loop that attach grimloc too (which I use to secure a facemask) is configured differently on the FM. Slightly more fiddly to access than when compared to HM.\n- The Crazy Black fabric is absolutely killer.

I tend to use the HM if got the wife and kids with me as it normally means that I need to take more crap! If I am on my own or we are just popping out and don’t need to take snacks etc, then normally go for the FM.\n- The HM is slightly more comfortable when fully loaded, as the ‘wing’ attaching the strap to main body of bag is bigger.\n- The loop that attach grimloc too (which I use to secure a facemask) is configured differently on the FM. Slightly more fiddly to access than when compared to HM.\n- The Crazy Black fabric is absolutely killer. A real mash-up of textures that looks quite boring in product pics but is really unique in the flesh.",

            "body": "Not sure why but text did not seem to add on post. Sorry if accidently added commentary twice.\n\nQuick comparison between Hip Monkey (v1 I think) and Full Moon.\n\nNote that both capable of being synched and expanded slightly using webbing at sides. This post based upon both being fully synched. Added ITW Web Dominators to do this.\n\nHip Monkey - Foliage cw. Duraflex buckle replaced with Austrialpin Cobra. ITE Web dominators and Grimloc added.\n\nFull Moon - Japan exclusive ‘Crazy Black’ cw, which is comprised of various fabrics. Duraflex buckle replaced with iTW Cobra. ITW Web dominators and Grimloc added.\n\nBack padding on each is large and comfortable. Wide strap on each, they both carry loads well. \n\nFront pocket on both normally used to hold iphone 12 pro plus key case or a small orbitgear pouch with medical pack.\n\nTo show capacity, used Camelbak 750ml and Ironheart IHSH-75 denim shirt in XL. Remember this is with them fully synched, so lowest volume.\n\nFew key points -\n\n- Zip access on both is different. HM has more of a lid style opening, whilst FM the Zip runs straight over the top. I would say that the HM configuration allows you to cram more stuff in.\n\n- HM certainly holds more. I could have fitted a few more bits in there. I tend to use the HM if got the wife and kids with me as it normally means that I need to take more crap! If I am on my own or we are just popping out and don’t need to take snacks etc, then normally go for the FM.\n- The HM is slightly more comfortable when fully loaded, as the ‘wing’ attaching the strap to main body of bag is bigger.\n- The loop that attach grimloc too (which I use to secure a facemask) is configured differently on the FM. Slightly more fiddly to access than when compared to HM.\n- The Crazy Black fabric is absolutely killer. A real mash-up of textures that looks quite boring in product pics but is really unique in the flesh.",

You dont have to pull everything out to get to the thing at the bottom.\n-PocketS!  the deep elastic pockets on the sides can each fit two water bottles or a jacket or more.  Theyre real deep.  There's also the smaller zip pocket on the outside for a guidebook.  I stick bars in there. The most comparable duffel style packs (Metolius and BD) Do not have pockets on the outside. The BD one (stone duffel 45? i think)has a built in rope tarp, which is nice if youre cragging. \n-Support.  This pack has a full backpack support system.  makes it easy to carry lots of stuff for a long time.\n\nCONS:\n-Usually too big.  I can fit everything I need for a day of trad and theres still space.  You can put two peoples stuff in this pack.  \n-pricey.  It is more expensive than a lot of the other similar packs.\n-If you want the built in rope tarp check out the BD pack\n\nBottom Line:\n\nI really like mine and would totally recommend it.  20% member coupon off an already discounted price makes the choice easier for sure.",

        "selftext": "**Hi** r/onebag**!** \n\n**I recently returned from a 10-week trip to Europe. This is everything I carried.** \n\n[ This is everything I carry. One week or three months, doesn’t matter!  ](https://preview.redd.it/3zybzrpnlhdc1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9994a2006e58b287e134f3b5465c88b1030b41)\n\n*I posted my travel gear packing list to* [*my website*](https://loganletsgo.com/)*. I wasn't able to share the link for it on this sub, so I'm creating this post here.* \n\n*I copied this from my post, so apologies if the formatting is a little weird. I tried my best to clean it up.* \n\n[Read my post about packing light](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/improve-your-travels-by-packing-light) if the concept is new to you, or if you don’t believe it’s possible. \n\nI will update [this page](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/my-travel-gear) regularly, and date it.   \nI need to add more photos, so check in later for that.   \nAll gear is current as of January 2024. \n\nI don’t spend a ton of money on gear and clothes, because I don’t want to be crushed if I lost my pack. I put too many hours of research, trial and error into these things, but the actual investment isn’t crazy. Everything can be easily replaced. \n\n**Pack**  \nI use a 20L backpack, [a brilliant design by Nashville Pack](https://nashvillepack.com/collections/made-to-order-packs/products/made-to-order-bridge-pack-1). It's absolutely perfect. \n\nI met these guys at Trail Days, an annual event for Appalachian Trail thru hikers. I’ve only hiked sections of the AT, but the people at Nashville Pack are [triple crowners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Hiking), having completed all three major thru hiking trails in the USA (AT, CDT, PCT) - multiple times. This pack stood that test. \n\nWhen I saw it, I knew it was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a bulletproof roll-top pack, with plenty extra stuff sack storage on the exterior. The best feature of this pack is the shoulder straps that gently form to your body, rather than foam that cuts into your shoulders like most packs have. This pack has no zippers. By far the most expensive piece of travel gear I have (not counting my phone). Worth every penny. \n\n**Down jacket**  \nThe puffy. A crucial piece of warm weather gear for the lightweight traveler. [Decathlon makes an elite down jacket](https://www.decathlon.com/collections/mens-down-jackets/products/forclaz-mt100-hooded-down-puffer-jacket-167571?) for a price tag that doesn't make me sick. I've worn this jacket in the backcountry, traveled through Europe with it, and beaten it up for daily use back home. You won't find a better puffy for that price. The warmth-to-weight ratio is outstanding. A down jacket is a must-have. I prefer one with a hood and pockets, but you can find some without those.  \n\n**Rain jacket**  \nI refuse to pay top dollar for an ultralight rain shell. This nearly weightless piece of plastic shouldn't cost more than dinner. That's why I have a [budget-friendly frogg toggs](https://www.froggtoggs.com/frogg-toggsr-ultra-lite-rain-jacket-4748).  This thing has kept me dry. It does its job. But you do pay for what  you get. It has no pockets, it's not stylish, and it's not extremely  durable. I prefer the oversized baggy build of this jacket, because I can wear layers underneath and still have plenty of wiggle room. \n\n**Hoody/fleece**   \nIf I was to lose my pack, I must admit that I'd be devastated to lose my Melanzana fleece hoody. This thing has traveled the world with me, kept me cozy in airplanes and on mountaintops. We've had a great run together, going on strong for almost six years now. In my rare selfies, I'm probably wearing the melly. I'll never leave home without a trusty mid-layer. \n\n**Long-sleeve button-ups**  \nI bring two. One is colorful, thin and breathable for warm weather. The other is black and slightly thicker material. Both can be worn for a night out. It's nice to have two. When one needs a wash, I can wear the other one. No special brand - both of these were thrift store finds. \n\n**T-shirts**  \nOn my latest trip I carried three t-shirts. One black, one blue-gray, one mustard-brown. All three can be worn for a workout, or for casual. It's a t-shirt, I don't overthink it. Sometimes I'll also bring a short-sleeve collared shirt. This is a luxury item for me. Not necessary. \n\nIf you've read a hundred travel blogs (like I have), you've heard the benefits of wool preached again and again. Read my section on socks for more info about wool. I haven't yet made the switch to wool shirts for travel. Cotton’s downside is it will need to be washed far more often than wool. There's no doubt about that. I’m sure I’ll make the switch soon enough. \n\n**Shorts**  \nI bring two pairs on warm-weather trips. [Anthem Athletics shorts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VZBSK1R/ref=dp_iou_view_item?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1) with zipper pockets, all black. I've been wearing these shorts for workouts for years. The best I've ever had. I love the deep zipper pockets, keeping my stuff secure. \n\nThe other pair is a 5-inch athletic fit all-day style shorts. These are versatile, good for any occasion. I can wear them during active exploration, or pair with a button-up for a clean look. It has a hidden zipper pocket too, where I keep my wallet and locker key. \n\nI prefer 5-inch shorts. I'm a short man (and I have nice legs). Short shorts is a better look for me than longer shorts that hover around the knees. \n\n**Pants**  \nThis decision depends on the climate. Knowing I'd start my trip in Portugal and Spain during warmer months, I brought one pair of pants. Thin nylon hiking pants from Kuhl that also look good enough to wear with a button-up. These served me well for a month. \n\nWhen I flew  from Barcelona to Budapest, I knew I'd need a pair of jeans for the  colder weather. At a thrift store I snagged a pair of black jeans, a  canvas coat and a blue beanie for 23 Euro. \n\nWhatever I might need,  I can always find in my destinations. I don't pack winter clothes  (besides a puffy and hoody) when I won't be in winter climates for the  first few weeks of my trip. I'll just buy what I need in my new cold  environment. There's no sense in lugging around clothes I'll never wear  for weeks at a time. \n\n**Undies**  \nI carry four pairs. They're easy to wash, and dry overnight. [David Archy](https://davidarchy.com/)  is the most comfortable I've ever had. I've been wearing them for  years. They're made from a bamboo material. Incredibly soft and  breathable. Downside, they don't dry quickly - faster than cotton, but  not as fast as wool. I haven't made the switch to wool just yet, because  I love them so much. \n\n**Socks**  \nIf  you don't have wool socks, you don't know what you're missing. Wool  keeps you warm when it's cold, and keeps you cool when it's hot. Wool  dries quickly. Wool is naturally anti-odor, anti-bacterial. Throw away  all of your cotton socks and replace them with wool. I can wear a single  pair for two or three days before needing to switch to a clean pair. \n\nI  bring four pairs. I prefer a thinner lightweight over the thicker  midweight hiking sock. I wear only crew socks, which goes above the  ankle. Black socks, black shoes. That's my thing! Darn Tough makes [the best socks](https://darntough.com/products/mens-merino-wool-light-hiker-micro-crew-lightweight-hiking-socks) I’ve ever found. \n\n**Shoes**  \nI  bring one pair of shoes when I travel. The shoes on my feet. I don't  have a need for sandals or boots or a nice pair of dress shoes. The  weight and space savings of having no shoes in my pack is enormous.  Shoes are bulky, heavy, annoying to pack. Avoid this at all costs if you  can. \n\nOn my latest trip I wore the exact same pair of  shoes for 72 days straight. They didn't smell great during my final  week, but they kept my feet safe and happy. Even if I was convinced I  needed a second pair of shoes, I’d do everything in my power to persuade  myself to bring only one pair. \n\nI wear barefoot/minimalist shoes.  They have no cushioned sole, which allows my feet to feel the texture  of the ground, sending that constant signal of information to my brain.  They have a wider toe box, which allows my toes to spread out and party.  \n\nMy favorite shoes of all time are the [Vivobarefoot Primus](https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/primus-trail-ii-fg-mens-ss22)  trail runners, all black. My every day shoes. I'm on my fourth pair.  They can almost double as sandals. When I go to the beach, I can put  them on with wet and sandy feet, and easily clean out the sand, and  they'll dry quickly. \n\nAll black socks and shoes can pair  with anything, and they're far less flashy than bright and colorful  running shoes. I can get away with wearing these to a nice dinner. \n\nEven  if that’s not true, it doesn’t matter. As a lightweight traveler, you  have stop caring what anyone thinks about how you dress. Just be  respectful of religious places that have a dress code. \n\n**Belt**  \nThis  decision is easy. I pack my lightest weight belt. I weigh the few belts  I own and pick the lightest one. My leather belt looks good, but it's  heavy. Nobody will notice or care about the style of belt I wear. Always  go light! \n\n**Hats**  \nA standard  snapback cap is non-negotiable for me. When the sun is out, I'm wearing a  hat. Lately I've been really digging this black nylon hat my sister got  me for my birthday. Easy to wash and dries quickly. But most  importantly, it protects my face from sunburns, and it keeps the hair  out of my face on windy days. \n\nI'll bring a beanie only if  it will be cold in my destination. Or just buy one there. Beanies might  be the most common item you'll find in stores in cold climates. Tourist  shops sell them by the thousands. Who doesn't want a big  brightly-colored beanie that says SLOVAKIA in all caps? \n\n**Buff**  \nThis amazing piece of fabric doubles  as a scarf and an eye mask for sleep. Your neck or ears are cold? The  buff can handle that. Sunlight waking you up too early? Buff has you  covered. I found mine on sale at REI years ago. Outdoor Research brand.  It's black, wool and has a few holes. I'll rock this thing til it dies.  The buff has many uses! Everyone should have a wool buff. \n\n**Bandana**  \nRemember  what I said about the common appearance of my melly hoody in selfies?  Warm weather selfies will often feature the appearance of a bandana  around my neck. Lately I've been carrying a red one, but the color will  change from time to time. The bandana keeps my neck protected from the  sun. It adds color to my often-black wardrobe. It can clean the sweat  off my face or the dirt off my hands. It can wipe up coffee spills on a  train. Another versatile travel item. \n\n**Fanny pack**  \nI  bought this specific hip-belt pack (made by Waymark Gear Co.) because it can fit my Kindle and bluetooth keyboard. It's an odd shape compared to most packs, which makes it ideal for awkward rectangular-shaped items. I'll bring it on a  run to hold my phone, wallet, snacks and locker key so they're not  bouncing around in my pockets. \n\nThe \"man purse\" is common  in Europe. I don't understand what exactly all these men need to be  carrying around at all times. No judgement, I'm just curious. The fanny  pack (worn cross-body) is trending right now, so maybe fashion explains  this. It's rare that I have a need for it, but it can definitely be  handy on occasion. \n\n**Phone**  \nArguably the most important piece of travel gear (besides the obvious passport). I have the [Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://swappa.com/buy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold4-5g).  This phone unfolds to reveal a larger screen similar to a tablet. It  also has a standard front screen, which is slightly narrower than a  regular phone. \n\nI'll likely never make the switch back to a  regular phone, I love it so much. The Fold is here to stay. Internet  browsing, reading articles and books, looking at my travel photos,  searching on Google Maps - everything is better on the big screen. Since  it's two phones, the battery lasts twice as long. I can go a full 24  hours on one charge, sometimes longer. \n\nI buy sim cards in destinations, or snag an eSIM online. I’ll write a separate post about this. \n\n**Books**  \nOn  my latest trip, I brought my Kindle. I love my eReader, but I won't  carry it on a trip again. I find myself using my phone to read books  more often than the Kindle when I travel. Phone is always in my pocket,  so books are always accessible. The Kindle will continue to be my go-to  reader at home. It's rare for me to travel with paper books. I can't  justify the weight when I have 50 books on my Kindle and phone. \n\n**Earbuds**  \n[Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile-audio/galaxy-buds2-pro/).  High quality headphones are new for me. I've had these for half a year  now, and I finally understand the hype of earbuds. Tiny, can fit in my  pocket, virtually weightless, amazing audio quality, good enough noise  cancelling. \n\nThe only downside is buds can be easy to  misplace. I lost an earbud on a flight. When our plane landed, the kind  woman behind me found it under her seat. I got lucky! \n\n**Keyboard**  \nMicrosoft  makes a bluetooth keyboard that is foldable, lightweight and portable. I  pair this with my phone to create a \"mini laptop\" for writing. I unfold  my phone and unfold the keyboard, and in seconds I can write  comfortably. Not as good as a real laptop, but it works. And saves me a  few pounds, which is huge. \n\n**Toiletries**  \nNo need to deep dive on exactly what I carry, but I will note a few things. My beard trimmer is [designed for pets](https://www.amazon.com/WAHL-Professional-Animal-Trimmer-9961-2881/dp/B0002H3RZQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=306VEOI7XO7UU&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ae1RPpYjpwH7oJGHTv8sRbsxpeHLX2_LeS0SqcfRn6tbqdMVk_4or8clab_-iUIpkjLkeyXiolFF94_5SBaxr22Wj6l88-i-Ypsla_NTYjjEg78tDMCRD7zaivSbUCxtPB7Eq5n9jPa0pgktzDskCj1uBis0xaTI_n2RzdXY8pqJysvHCL81NAgWULpGnH87zHJtq1URR0oX7AiE75T-nzEHm22Jzf60CdNHyJyymZo.mWZLKRB61FqpHKq9tGiMuIUQD_PCvyo32eqSzP-npNY&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=wahl+9966&amp;qid=1705409130&amp;sprefix=wahl+9966%2Caps%2C163&amp;sr=8-1).  It’s tiny, and powered by a single battery, which allows me to avoid  carrying an additional charger. I tossed my other trimmers at home in  favor of this one. [Another good option](https://www.amazon.com/Wahl-Professional-Animal-Grooming-9861-900/dp/B00MNMDO3S/ref=sr_1_7?crid=Q1OD6H2I6UUP&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Nlo9EwAhceEZr6_5CvUv84HAZVy1s7E70zBAyGEh8UIrb8u74Qya7oNxlCBr8397K0ndSFa-aPuzgEtoHbbbZB3djwd7VJVz13eF_xMdzXf0qZ5cYOiJ3B673qmaGlRMfapsYVga4mfE595mP9HUBm6_ERnAsPnIU2QtqsH7_kcpTCXKJ3YNjraclcUJAYTVVgPfk4mfWr3S90Mz0B1ZSt6QiaDJaopBkYcCtan5868.7Ih6o6UaJCJF3E1aMOENciNXfJuQRdKJaazPA5YLOXs&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=wahl%2Banimal%2Btrimmer&amp;qid=1705409022&amp;sprefix=wahl%2Banimal%2Btrimme%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-7&amp;th=1). \n\nA shampoo soap bar is non-negotiable for me. I always carry one. I use [this amazing little Matador pouch](https://www.matadorequipment.com/collections/toiletry-items-collection/products/flatpak-soap-bar-case) to keep it dry, clean and separate from everything else. I don’t know how they do it, but the dry-through tech really works. \n\nMy hair brush is lightweight, and it’s undefeated. [This thing](https://www.tangleteezer.com/us/shop/detangling/thick-curly/salsa-red/) backs down to no tangle. \n\n**Towel**  \nI  love my little travel towel. Maybe the most useful travel item I own.  Some hostels don’t provide towels, or charge a fee for use. The fee is  usually insignificant, but why pay for a towel when I can bring one that  is nearly weightless, packs down smaller than a candy bar and dries  insanely fast? Soak with warm water and soap, rinse, and it’s clean in  an instant. I like the loop for easy hang-dry. Made by PackTowl ([hand size](https://www.packtowl.com/shop/towels/ultralite-towel/11124.html), 16 x 36 in). \n\nI  also have a tiny rag that must be military-grade, because it’s the most  astounding thing I own, it probably costs pennies to make and I got it  for free. It comes prepackaged in a little cube, add water and it  expands. It weighs nothing, dries in minutes, and it’s durable and easy  to clean. Not a crucial piece of gear, but nice to have handy. \n\n**Ear plugs**  \nThe  best sleep system, especially for hostels, is an eye mask and ear  plugs. It blows my mind that some travelers might dismiss this. The best  ear plugs [are silicone, not foam](https://www.amazon.com/Macks-Pillow-Soft-Silicone-Earplugs/dp/B07G1MWHNR). They won’t fall out in the middle of the night, and they block out more noise. \n\n**Cork massage ball**  \nMade by [Rawlogy](https://www.garagegrowngear.com/collections/rawlogy). It keeps my feet happy after tons of daily walking. \n\n**Charger**  \n[Anker 30W](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09J4XRSZJ/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1) phone charger with a 6-foot cable, with an extra tiny cable for the folding keyboard and LED light. \n\n**Travel adapter**  \n[Mogics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LMKSM92/?coliid=IUXOJZ0E48UST&amp;colid=38ZLIIF0OF1IZ&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it#) international power adapter. Incredibly tiny and lightweight. It has worked in all different outlet types I've tried. \n\n**Mini LED light**  \nA  gift from my dad. This little thing has a built in magnet. It comes in  handy in hostels at night or early mornings when I need a bit of light,  but don't want to use my phone flashlight. I wouldn't bring this if it  wasn't nearly weightless. \n\n**Heroclip**  \n[The Heroclip Mini](https://www.gearaid.com/products/heroclip-mini)  is a unique little tool. The basic function, a carabiner. The second  function, an additional hook with a rubber tip that enables you to hang  over the top of a door, ledge, counter. Comes in handy in bathrooms when  the hooks are missing or broken, and I need to hang my pack or jacket  off the floor. \n\n**Water bottle**  \nI’d  like to avoid drinking out of plastic, but for travel it’s too  convenient. The weight of a metal bottle is outrageous, and an [ultralight titanium bottle](https://www.snowpeak.com/products/ti-aurora-bottle)  is too expensive for me to risk losing. One liter of water by itself  weighs 1kg or 2.2 pounds. Adding a full pound with a metal bottle makes  no sense to me when plastic weighs only a few grams. \n\nIn  hot weather, I’ll bring a 1 liter bottle. I tie paracord on the  bottleneck for easy carry. In cooler temps, I’ll carry a smaller one  (550 to 700ml). I try to avoid buying water bottles. It’s a fun game for  me to see how long I can make one bottle last. I refill where it’s  convenient. Water fountains, tap water when it’s safe, asking restaurant  staff to fill my bottle. \n\n**Passport**  \nI  don't use a travel belt, or have some crazy system of securing my  passport. I just treat it like I would with any other valuable item,  like my phone or wallet. Be careful with it, lock it up when necessary. \n\n**Lock**  \nI  always take advantage of lockers at hostels. I never leave my pack  sitting out in the room when I'm not there. I'll leave some clothes  hanging around, leave the phone charger plugged in, but never my  important belongings. \n\nI prefer a lock with a key, rather  than a combination. Fussing with a combo in the dark is no fun. Key is  easy, and I don't lose a key. If you tend to lose things, then combo  might be better. \n\n**Organization system**  \nTravelers  often make two mistakes - not having a storage system at all, or using  too many packing cubes made from heavy material. \n\nHere’s my system:   \n16L [Granite Gear zipp sack](https://www.granitegear.com/zippsack.html) for all my clothes  \nDrawstring sack for socks &amp; undies (fits inside the clothes sack)   \nBasic toiletries bag  \nSmall pouch for all tiny things (lock, chargers, extra cash, backup credit cards, sim cards, etc.)  \nZiploc plastic baggie for snacks  \nPlastic bag with holes for dirty laundry (thanks, Marriott)\n\nItems that are stored loose inside my pack - puffy, melly, fanny pack.  \nItems that are stored loose outside my pack - hat, rain jacket, bandana, water bottle.   \nEverything else has a cozy home. \n\nThese sacks and pouches are all extremely lightweight items. The minimal  additional weight is worth it for ease of packing and unpacking.  Organization is so important! \n\nCarry less, eliminate stress and go farther! \n\n[my post about packing light mindset, philosophy, etc.](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/improve-your-travels-by-packing-light)\n\n[*Credit to Tynan*](https://tynan.com/gear2023/) *for inspiring this post, and for three items that I would’ve never found myself - my phone, travel adapter and beard trimmer.* ",

How did you handle laundry, did you hand wash it in the hostels or take it to a laundrette, and how often did you do this?\n2. How did you deal with a rather limited wardrobe? Was it all pretty informal or did you need to dress up at times?\n3. How did you find the barefoot shoes for long walks and city travel?\n4. Did you buy souveniers, and if so how did you manage those given the limited bag size?\n5. Did you have any security issues as a result of travelling so light e.g. airport security or at hostels?\n6.

                "body": "Hey thanks!   \nThe long weekend packing mentality really works. What you carry for a long weekend can last you for months, aside from some minor clothing adjustments depending on if you change climates. It really is that simple! \n\n1. I only used local laundromats, just whatever was near to my hostel and had a change machine. Some places accepted tap to pay or credit cards. They were ALL really nice. Never had an issue. \n\n2. Definitely informal. I had a nicer long sleeve button down that I'd wear with the Kuhl pants in warm weather, and then later black jeans in colder weather. A short sleeve collared shirt paired well with shorts if I wanted to avoid wearing one of my three t-shirts. In total I carried six shirts. Two long sleeve button up, one short sleeve collared, and 3 tees. 2 pairs of shorts, one pair of pants, and I bought a second pair later during my trip. Hoody, puffy. That was all my clothes. \n\n3. I've been wearing barefoot shoes for almost 4 years now, so my feet have adjusted. I know that if I'm walking ALL DAY, my feet will be sore at night. Cork massage ball is a game changer. I only wear cushioned soles (Altra Lone Peak) on multi-day hiking trips, where I'm hiking sun up to sun down. Other than that, the barefoot shoes I prefer 99% of the time. Even for long day hikes. It's only on mile 40 of a multi-day hike where my feet are completely dead with barefoot shoes. I tried it haha. So, yes I loved the vivos for my entire trip. Very happy with them, and I wear them every day all the time. \n\n4. All my souveniers from 10 weeks - one postcard from Budapest I gifted to my parents. One beanie, a pair of jeans &amp; a canvas coat I got out of necessity when I hit colder weather in Budapest. A second beanie I bought to support one of my favorite bands. That was it. My souveniers are thousands of photos stored on a cloud lol. \n\n5. Zero issues, my bag easily fit in all lockers at hostels, under my seat on 2 airplanes &amp; many trains and buses. \n\n6. I only carried my bag when I moved hostels/cities. I'd lock it up &amp; explore all day long. Sometimes I carried it around for a while if I wanted to get lost and was in no hurry to drop it off at a new hostel. Because it's lightweight it didn't bother me.\n\n7. Yes! [I wrote more about that here](https://loganletsgo.substack.com/p/improve-your-travels-by-packing-light). So many people commented on my pack, surprised I carried so little. A lot of travelers, even at hostels, carry big packs or suitcases, &amp; sometimes multiple pieces of luggage. It's fun when people are interested in traveling with less. It's a topic I clearly love to talk about lol.\n\nAnd I'll add that I have zero regrets. Which is why my current gear list is literally this same list from this post, minus my kindle. Kindle is the only item I'd drop (or add) after my recent trip. \n\nMy current predicament is how the hell do I pack a laptop that doesn't add 2lbs or more.... I'd love to bring a tiny laptop to write. But not worth the weight, unless something exists that I'm unaware of haha.",

        "title": "Some Math on Ornn, spreadsheets with base stats comparisons and ability calculations",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ornnmains/comments/6t6ac8/some_math_on_ornn_spreadsheets_with_base_stats/",
        "selftext": "Heya guys, Ornn's release has me personally excited so I've spent the last few days theorycrafting and watching gameplay of his to prepare myself for his coming release. The links on this post will lead to Imgur images of spreadsheets I made in a couple of hours to help me visualize and \"triangulate\" Ornn's base power. There's nothing terribly complicated here that most people wouldn't be able to do but I had the free time and figured it was an interesting exercise.\n\nThe first image is a base stat comparison between Ornn and 7 of his Vanguard brethren (Alistar, Leona, Gragas, Maokai, Malphite, Sion and Sejuani) since I felt comparing Ornn to other champions with a similar role and shared subclass was the optimal way to spot any particular advantages (or weaknesses) he could have. \n\n[Said image can be found here](http://i.imgur.com/Lpmyei5.png). I've double checked the numbers but it is possible I missed something. If you do catch one, call me out on it. The colors mean the following: green indicates that Ornn's stat is better, yellow indicates that they're the same while red indicates that Ornn's stat is worse.\n\nThere's a few important things to be taken from the spreadsheet, the ones I feel are important to note are:\n\n- Ornn's base stats are fairly lacking against the two dedicated supports included in this comparison, which isn't wholly unexpected given that supports are balanced around a lower gold income. More so if said supports are tanks.\n\n- Ornn's regeneration stats are fairly good compared to other laning tanks. In fact, out of the 4 more common laners in the spreadsheet (Gragas, Maokai, Malphite and Sion), his health regeneration is only beaten by Sion who holds the highest hp regen value at level 1 and 7th highest at level 18 out of all champions. \n\n- Just so, Sion holds the 31st highest mana regen value at level 1, Ornn will be tied with Tahm Kench and Fiora for the 32nd highest base mana regen on his release. Meaning he will be top 34 out of 117 mana-using champions of the game. This is fairly short-lived, however, as Ornn's fairly bad mana regen growth stat leads to him dropping to the lower end of the race as later stages approach.\n \n- In contrast, Ornn's base mana of 300 is a very pitiful value, but the +45/level growth stat is good enough so that by level 18 he has the 49th largest mana pool (again, of the 117 mana-using champions) so he's fairly average by late game. \n\n- These two factors combined, however, do point to mana issues. Early in the lane, Ornn can stay for prolonged periods of time due to a high mana regeneration, provided he doesn't go for prolonged or repeated trades. Playing passive may not be what Ornn wants to do however, so investing into flat mana and long-term mana sustain (e.g. Catalyst)  is likely a solid move. \n\n- Ornn's base AD is tied with Sion's for the 33rd highest base attack damage in the game. Also, his level 18 base attack damage is similarly high (albeit not as much as Sion's due to the latter's higher growth stat) at 119,22 being the 25th highest out of the 138 champions in the game (which would be the top 18 percentile). This is especially good given his Q's total attack damage scaling.\n\n- Speaking of Sion so much, I feel as if he was a \"template\" or is the closest equivalent to Ornn currently in-game. He too is a Vanguard whose defensive stats and crowd control are generally lower than those of his brethren but he receives some great base regeneration and AD to compensate.\n\n-  Ornn himself has some strong damage in his kit due to the highly spammable nature of his Q/W and high damage potential from his W/E/R but due to W's unique control scheme, E's damage being gated by terrain collision and his ultimate requiring proper and smart use (with a potential double Brittle proc attached), his baseline power is generally lower than something like a Maokai or Sejuani whose CC is much easier to use but whose damage potential is also generally lower.\n\nSpeaking of his abilities, I took the time to figure out just how much Q/W/E were benefiting from Ornn's own base stats due to the fact that their ratios are all total ratios of distinct stats. Q's base damage effectively adds Ornn's own base AD to it, W has a 12% maximum hp shield and E will always deal some damage tied to Ornn's resistances.\n\n[This is the table for his Q](http://i.imgur.com/8bQ3JpY.png), listing the damage you'll be getting from your base AD at any time (which is equal to your base AD at that time) as well as comparing the damage your Q will be dealing in different stages of the game depending on your max order. The table assumes your first 3 levels are used to unlock all your basic skills and that the following distribution of points is \"standard\" (first maxed ability at level 9, followed by one at 13 and then maxing the other from there on forward save for level 16's point into ultimate).\n\nMaxing Q second (or rather, having only 2 points in Q by level 9) implies a 90 damage reduction per Q and maxing Q third (or rather, having only 1 point in Q by level 9) implies a 120 damage reduction per Q at level 9. This is all fairly intuitive since you're only losing base damage from the ability's rank up. \n\nThis means that a rank 1 Q at level 9 (assuming no AD from other sources) will be dealing 47% of a Rank 5 Q's damage and that a rank 2 Q at level 9 will be dealing 60% of a Rank 5 Q's damage. [Using the data from the previous table we can create this one to compare the different max orders.](http://i.imgur.com/PVGZoYS.png)\n\n[In a similar vein, this is the table for his W, listing his shield's base value. Since the shield's capacity and health ratio doesn't vary per the ability's rank, max order is irrelevant in this case (albeit IIRC, shield duration does change per rank).](http://i.imgur.com/ymUC5Kn.png)\n\nW isn't only the shield, however, since it has a pretty heavy damage component as well. The table for W's damage is quite a bit more complicated, however, given that you can tackle both [minimum damage](http://i.imgur.com/185nGtN.png) and [maximum damage](http://i.imgur.com/rOYFctM.png). I'm not too good with figuring out the % damage bit since I feel it doesn't tell quite as a clear story as the minimum (or base) damage values do. \n\nThe 2nd point in W represents a 63% increase in minimum damage (80 -&gt; 130) which is especially significant. Compared to the 2nd point in Q, for example, which increases damage by a rough 33%.\n\n[This is a lot of stuff, however. This table is a quick \"summary\" of W's functioning, listing the thresholds at which W is dealing more damage than it's listed minimum damage.](http://i.imgur.com/lEy190g.png)\n\nAnd that's about it, really. I'm a bit tired and am not a professional data analyst or anything of the sort. Hopefully the info here can be used to start a constructive discussion or can be of use to anyone looking for info.\n\n[Also, this would be the damage you're looking to add into your Es with your base armor and magic resist, already taking into account tonight's nerf.](http://i.imgur.com/aRA3FnR.png) It has an extra ~17/~34 damage, depending on whether you hit the shockwave, at level 1. Assuming the standard \"method\" is leveling it at level 3, then it has ~19/~39 more damage than the base values alone (so assuming you hit the dash+knock up, you'll be dealing about 100 damage level 3).\n\nBe sure to warn me of any potential mistake and have fun out there, soon-to-be mountainsmiths.\n\n(EDIT: added E Armor+MR damage bonus table.)",

But in my opinion for max order for abilities assuming you are in a melee match up top or jungle I would max W &gt; E &gt; Q. The CDR on W max is the best out of the 3 also applies brittle which is extremely strong in trades since it does a lot of max HP damage. So not only does leveling W increase base damage but gives more damage from brittle effect. Also a lower CD shield of course.\n\nCan't max E unless you are trying for an all in but mid game you want E up as much as possible of course since it's your main CC and that damage scaling is also really strong on it.\n\nThat leaves Q last usually. Only time I could see Q maybe maxing is when vs ranged matchups in the jungle do to the slow helping more there and just poke or farming from a distance. Even then seems a little weak maxing Q.",
