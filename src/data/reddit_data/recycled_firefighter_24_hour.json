            "body": "I had preordered this bag during Black Friday sales week, but it didn't ship until late January (it seems to be in stock on their website now).  Like many people getting into the bag market, I had seen a lot of the square clamshel type bags that forego built in organization or neat feaures or tricks, in favor of a more overbuilt, tough as nails, type of proposition.  I had looked at Evergoods and GoRucks etc, and never really bit because of price (I'll only really bite on a good deal), weight, and some other considerations (I'm actually not much of a backpack guy, I'm more of a shoulder bag guy -slings/camera bags/man purses lol).  But the Recycled Firefighter was on the radar cause it seemed to be one of the lighter \"simple square\" backpacks and I do like supporting domestically made bags when possible.  After looking at Recycled Firefighters lineup I decided to go with their big 24hr+ as I could get more use out of a bigger backpack.  \n\n\nThis bag really won me over in the last few weeks, just handling it it feels tough (the 1000D will abrade your skin and clothes).  My own personal measurements of this bag when pretty full come out to be about 18.5\"x 12\"x 8\" which isn't quite the same as what the website lists, but comes out to be about 28-29L and there is plenty of fabric slack in the panels so you probably can overstuff this bag easily. The bag itself does not have much in the way of internal structure like many bags (comparing it to my 500D CT21 the bag walls and sides are softer on they 24hr+), but has a good bit of foam on the back and bottom, which provides most of the structure of the backpack.  The straps are nice and wide and padded, really comfy.  In use I love the compression straps coupled with the more supple side walls.  This bag is functionally expandable, as you can compress one of the unused compartments when not in use and as shown in pictures it will get as slim as any other single compartment clamshell bag.  One thing that doesn't feel as bombproof as the rest is the zipper pulls, they seem to be some type of cloth, not braided nylon or rope.  Easily replaceable at least.  I do wish it had a luggage passthrough lol, but thats just me (I'd probably bring a smaller bag with rolling luggage tbh).  Any external molle or bottle pockets would sort of ruin its whole stripped down vibe (though if you need that stuff - that Greenroom Northseeker seems like pocketed alternative ).  I've actually replaced my expandable Knack pack medium with this in my \"keeper\" lineup.    \n\n\nI did get the hardback loop panel, and while its cool, I'm not sure about it personally, as the panel is fairly substantial and adds weight and stiffness.  The squared off shape of the backpack really is very efficient for usable packing volume vs weight.  I think people in the market for this sort of simple but tough type of bag should give it a good look, especially if you are the type thats hard on your gear but doesn't need/want any extra attachments to ruin the look.  If you want more features or a more skin/clothing friendly fabric, you may want to look elsewhere.  Otherwise if you are interested, I'd recommend signing up for their email list where they will bombard you with sales/coupon codes etc.  \n\n\nAs always happy to answer any questions about it.",

It's a tough, minimalist pack. A few observations that should also apply to the 24 HR+:\n\n* I like that the RFF 24's sternum strap is easily removed (and added back) as I wanted as few dangling  bits as possible for this bag.\n* All zippers, including those for the interior mesh compartments, are #10's but they're not YKK. The brand is not specified on the pulls or on RFF's website.\n* A few stray threads had to be snipped--not an issue with me.\n* Webbing handles, as strong as they may be, tend to lack structure. A [paracord wrap](https://imgur.com/a/DCeJnmw)  on the 24's top handle stands it up, improves hand hold, and optionally adds more lash points\n* When used for EDC I've taken to leaving my Chrome Organiser in the front pocket of the RFF 24. It's a versatile, modular solution for those wanting the organization of EDC in a minimalist travel pack (with a front, vertically zipped pocket). [Write up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/19eug1t/in_praise_of_chromes_messenger_organizer/).\n* I'm impressed with the shoulder straps. I do have bags with as much padding in the straps but the RFF, at 3 inches, has the widest straps of all my sub 50 litre bags. They distribute load over a greater area for improved comfort. The downside here is more trapped sweat under exertion.\n* I like the webbing and D rings on the harness. These low cost unobtrusive add-ons are all on the plus side.\n* As the OP mentioned: the exterior of this pack, all the contact points, are 1000D Cordura. So if prematurely wearing out your clothing is a concern, perhaps you should look elsewhere.\n* As per OP's observations on the RFF's (lack of) structure. Soft, semi-structured packs like the RFF with a discrete laptop compartment are ideal candidates for greater spinal fortitude by the addition of [Coroplast](https://www.google.com/search?q=Coroplast&amp;oq=Coroplast&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGDzSAQgxNzczajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) (4 mm corrugated plastic board, like cardboard). It's light, cheap, immune to soakings, tough, and slim enough that it will fit alongside a laptop, adding further protection. [Here's my RFF 24 accessorised with a Coroplast panel](https://imgur.com/a/skaXlju) liberated from a neighbourhood realtor's sign. Note: enhancing the RFF 24's rigidity this way is an option, not an indication it lacks sufficient structure. It's a soft pack, nothing wrong with that.\n\nThat's it for now. Cheers.",

            "body": "I had preordered this bag during Black Friday sales week, but it didn't ship until late January (it seems to be in stock on their website now).  Like many people getting into the bag market, I had seen a lot of the square clamshel type bags that forego built in organization or neat feaures or tricks, in favor of a more overbuilt, tough as nails, type of proposition.  I had looked at Evergoods and GoRucks etc, and never really bit because of price (I'll only really bite on a good deal), weight, and some other considerations (I'm actually not much of a backpack guy, I'm more of a shoulder bag guy -slings/camera bags/man purses lol).  But the Recycled Firefighter was on the radar cause it seemed to be one of the lighter \"simple square\" backpacks and I do like supporting domestically made bags when possible.  After looking at Recycled Firefighters lineup I decided to go with their big 24hr+ as I could get more use out of a bigger backpack.  \n\n\nThis bag really won me over in the last few weeks, just handling it it feels tough (the 1000D will abrade your skin and clothes).  My own personal measurements of this bag when pretty full come out to be about 18.5\"x 12\"x 8\" which isn't quite the same as what the website lists, but comes out to be about 28-29L and there is plenty of fabric slack in the panels so you probably can overstuff this bag easily. The bag itself does not have much in the way of internal structure like many bags (comparing it to my 500D CT21 the bag walls and sides are softer on they 24hr+), but has a good bit of foam on the back and bottom, which provides most of the structure of the backpack.  The straps are nice and wide and padded, really comfy.  In use I love the compression straps coupled with the more supple side walls.  This bag is functionally expandable, as you can compress one of the unused compartments when not in use and as shown in pictures it will get as slim as any other single compartment clamshell bag.  One thing that doesn't feel as bombproof as the rest is the zipper pulls, they seem to be some type of cloth, not braided nylon or rope.  Easily replaceable at least.  I do wish it had a luggage passthrough lol, but thats just me (I'd probably bring a smaller bag with rolling luggage tbh).  Any external molle or bottle pockets would sort of ruin its whole stripped down vibe (though if you need that stuff - that Greenroom Northseeker seems like pocketed alternative ).  I've actually replaced my expandable Knack pack medium with this in my \"keeper\" lineup.    \n\n\nI did get the hardback loop panel, and while its cool, I'm not sure about it personally, as the panel is fairly substantial and adds weight and stiffness.  The squared off shape of the backpack really is very efficient for usable packing volume vs weight.  I think people in the market for this sort of simple but tough type of bag should give it a good look, especially if you are the type thats hard on your gear but doesn't need/want any extra attachments to ruin the look.  If you want more features or a more skin/clothing friendly fabric, you may want to look elsewhere.  Otherwise if you are interested, I'd recommend signing up for their email list where they will bombard you with sales/coupon codes etc.  \n\n\nAs always happy to answer any questions about it.",

It's a tough, minimalist pack. A few observations that should also apply to the 24 HR+:\n\n* I like that the RFF 24's sternum strap is easily removed (and added back) as I wanted as few dangling  bits as possible for this bag.\n* All zippers, including those for the interior mesh compartments, are #10's but they're not YKK. The brand is not specified on the pulls or on RFF's website.\n* A few stray threads had to be snipped--not an issue with me.\n* Webbing handles, as strong as they may be, tend to lack structure. A [paracord wrap](https://imgur.com/a/DCeJnmw)  on the 24's top handle stands it up, improves hand hold, and optionally adds more lash points\n* When used for EDC I've taken to leaving my Chrome Organiser in the front pocket of the RFF 24.

These low cost unobtrusive add-ons are all on the plus side.\n* As the OP mentioned: the exterior of this pack, all the contact points, are 1000D Cordura. So if prematurely wearing out your clothing is a concern, perhaps you should look elsewhere.\n* As per OP's observations on the RFF's (lack of) structure. Soft, semi-structured packs like the RFF with a discrete laptop compartment are ideal candidates for greater spinal fortitude by the addition of [Coroplast](https://www.google.com/search?q=Coroplast&amp;oq=Coroplast&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGDzSAQgxNzczajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) (4 mm corrugated plastic board, like cardboard). It's light, cheap, immune to soakings, tough, and slim enough that it will fit alongside a laptop, adding further protection.

            "body": "I had preordered this bag during Black Friday sales week, but it didn't ship until late January (it seems to be in stock on their website now).  Like many people getting into the bag market, I had seen a lot of the square clamshel type bags that forego built in organization or neat feaures or tricks, in favor of a more overbuilt, tough as nails, type of proposition.  I had looked at Evergoods and GoRucks etc, and never really bit because of price (I'll only really bite on a good deal), weight, and some other considerations (I'm actually not much of a backpack guy, I'm more of a shoulder bag guy -slings/camera bags/man purses lol).  But the Recycled Firefighter was on the radar cause it seemed to be one of the lighter \"simple square\" backpacks and I do like supporting domestically made bags when possible.  After looking at Recycled Firefighters lineup I decided to go with their big 24hr+ as I could get more use out of a bigger backpack.  \n\n\nThis bag really won me over in the last few weeks, just handling it it feels tough (the 1000D will abrade your skin and clothes).  My own personal measurements of this bag when pretty full come out to be about 18.5\"x 12\"x 8\" which isn't quite the same as what the website lists, but comes out to be about 28-29L and there is plenty of fabric slack in the panels so you probably can overstuff this bag easily. The bag itself does not have much in the way of internal structure like many bags (comparing it to my 500D CT21 the bag walls and sides are softer on they 24hr+), but has a good bit of foam on the back and bottom, which provides most of the structure of the backpack.  The straps are nice and wide and padded, really comfy.  In use I love the compression straps coupled with the more supple side walls.  This bag is functionally expandable, as you can compress one of the unused compartments when not in use and as shown in pictures it will get as slim as any other single compartment clamshell bag.  One thing that doesn't feel as bombproof as the rest is the zipper pulls, they seem to be some type of cloth, not braided nylon or rope.  Easily replaceable at least.  I do wish it had a luggage passthrough lol, but thats just me (I'd probably bring a smaller bag with rolling luggage tbh).  Any external molle or bottle pockets would sort of ruin its whole stripped down vibe (though if you need that stuff - that Greenroom Northseeker seems like pocketed alternative ).  I've actually replaced my expandable Knack pack medium with this in my \"keeper\" lineup.    \n\n\nI did get the hardback loop panel, and while its cool, I'm not sure about it personally, as the panel is fairly substantial and adds weight and stiffness.  The squared off shape of the backpack really is very efficient for usable packing volume vs weight.  I think people in the market for this sort of simple but tough type of bag should give it a good look, especially if you are the type thats hard on your gear but doesn't need/want any extra attachments to ruin the look.  If you want more features or a more skin/clothing friendly fabric, you may want to look elsewhere.  Otherwise if you are interested, I'd recommend signing up for their email list where they will bombard you with sales/coupon codes etc.  \n\n\nAs always happy to answer any questions about it.",

            "body": "I had preordered this bag during Black Friday sales week, but it didn't ship until late January (it seems to be in stock on their website now).  Like many people getting into the bag market, I had seen a lot of the square clamshel type bags that forego built in organization or neat feaures or tricks, in favor of a more overbuilt, tough as nails, type of proposition.  I had looked at Evergoods and GoRucks etc, and never really bit because of price (I'll only really bite on a good deal), weight, and some other considerations (I'm actually not much of a backpack guy, I'm more of a shoulder bag guy -slings/camera bags/man purses lol).  But the Recycled Firefighter was on the radar cause it seemed to be one of the lighter \"simple square\" backpacks and I do like supporting domestically made bags when possible.  After looking at Recycled Firefighters lineup I decided to go with their big 24hr+ as I could get more use out of a bigger backpack.  \n\n\nThis bag really won me over in the last few weeks, just handling it it feels tough (the 1000D will abrade your skin and clothes).  My own personal measurements of this bag when pretty full come out to be about 18.5\"x 12\"x 8\" which isn't quite the same as what the website lists, but comes out to be about 28-29L and there is plenty of fabric slack in the panels so you probably can overstuff this bag easily. The bag itself does not have much in the way of internal structure like many bags (comparing it to my 500D CT21 the bag walls and sides are softer on they 24hr+), but has a good bit of foam on the back and bottom, which provides most of the structure of the backpack.  The straps are nice and wide and padded, really comfy.  In use I love the compression straps coupled with the more supple side walls.  This bag is functionally expandable, as you can compress one of the unused compartments when not in use and as shown in pictures it will get as slim as any other single compartment clamshell bag.  One thing that doesn't feel as bombproof as the rest is the zipper pulls, they seem to be some type of cloth, not braided nylon or rope.  Easily replaceable at least.  I do wish it had a luggage passthrough lol, but thats just me (I'd probably bring a smaller bag with rolling luggage tbh).  Any external molle or bottle pockets would sort of ruin its whole stripped down vibe (though if you need that stuff - that Greenroom Northseeker seems like pocketed alternative ).  I've actually replaced my expandable Knack pack medium with this in my \"keeper\" lineup.    \n\n\nI did get the hardback loop panel, and while its cool, I'm not sure about it personally, as the panel is fairly substantial and adds weight and stiffness.  The squared off shape of the backpack really is very efficient for usable packing volume vs weight.  I think people in the market for this sort of simple but tough type of bag should give it a good look, especially if you are the type thats hard on your gear but doesn't need/want any extra attachments to ruin the look.  If you want more features or a more skin/clothing friendly fabric, you may want to look elsewhere.  Otherwise if you are interested, I'd recommend signing up for their email list where they will bombard you with sales/coupon codes etc.  \n\n\nAs always happy to answer any questions about it.",

            "body": "Thank you for your insights OP. I received the regular RFF 24 Hour, \\~20ish litres, in January and am also pleased for many of reasons the OP outlined. It's a tough, minimalist pack. A few observations that should also apply to the 24 HR+:\n\n* I like that the RFF 24's sternum strap is easily removed (and added back) as I wanted as few dangling  bits as possible for this bag.\n* All zippers, including those for the interior mesh compartments, are #10's but they're not YKK. The brand is not specified on the pulls or on RFF's website.\n* A few stray threads had to be snipped--not an issue with me.\n* Webbing handles, as strong as they may be, tend to lack structure. A [paracord wrap](https://imgur.com/a/DCeJnmw)  on the 24's top handle stands it up, improves hand hold, and optionally adds more lash points\n* When used for EDC I've taken to leaving my Chrome Organiser in the front pocket of the RFF 24. It's a versatile, modular solution for those wanting the organization of EDC in a minimalist travel pack (with a front, vertically zipped pocket). [Write up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/19eug1t/in_praise_of_chromes_messenger_organizer/).\n* I'm impressed with the shoulder straps. I do have bags with as much padding in the straps but the RFF, at 3 inches, has the widest straps of all my sub 50 litre bags. They distribute load over a greater area for improved comfort. The downside here is more trapped sweat under exertion.\n* I like the webbing and D rings on the harness. These low cost unobtrusive add-ons are all on the plus side.\n* As the OP mentioned: the exterior of this pack, all the contact points, are 1000D Cordura. So if prematurely wearing out your clothing is a concern, perhaps you should look elsewhere.\n* As per OP's observations on the RFF's (lack of) structure. Soft, semi-structured packs like the RFF with a discrete laptop compartment are ideal candidates for greater spinal fortitude by the addition of [Coroplast](https://www.google.com/search?q=Coroplast&amp;oq=Coroplast&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGDzSAQgxNzczajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) (4 mm corrugated plastic board, like cardboard). It's light, cheap, immune to soakings, tough, and slim enough that it will fit alongside a laptop, adding further protection. [Here's my RFF 24 accessorised with a Coroplast panel](https://imgur.com/a/skaXlju) liberated from a neighbourhood realtor's sign. Note: enhancing the RFF 24's rigidity this way is an option, not an indication it lacks sufficient structure. It's a soft pack, nothing wrong with that.\n\nThat's it for now. Cheers.",

            "body": "I had preordered this bag during Black Friday sales week, but it didn't ship until late January (it seems to be in stock on their website now).  Like many people getting into the bag market, I had seen a lot of the square clamshel type bags that forego built in organization or neat feaures or tricks, in favor of a more overbuilt, tough as nails, type of proposition.  I had looked at Evergoods and GoRucks etc, and never really bit because of price (I'll only really bite on a good deal), weight, and some other considerations (I'm actually not much of a backpack guy, I'm more of a shoulder bag guy -slings/camera bags/man purses lol).  But the Recycled Firefighter was on the radar cause it seemed to be one of the lighter \"simple square\" backpacks and I do like supporting domestically made bags when possible.  After looking at Recycled Firefighters lineup I decided to go with their big 24hr+ as I could get more use out of a bigger backpack.  \n\n\nThis bag really won me over in the last few weeks, just handling it it feels tough (the 1000D will abrade your skin and clothes).  My own personal measurements of this bag when pretty full come out to be about 18.5\"x 12\"x 8\" which isn't quite the same as what the website lists, but comes out to be about 28-29L and there is plenty of fabric slack in the panels so you probably can overstuff this bag easily. The bag itself does not have much in the way of internal structure like many bags (comparing it to my 500D CT21 the bag walls and sides are softer on they 24hr+), but has a good bit of foam on the back and bottom, which provides most of the structure of the backpack.  The straps are nice and wide and padded, really comfy.  In use I love the compression straps coupled with the more supple side walls.  This bag is functionally expandable, as you can compress one of the unused compartments when not in use and as shown in pictures it will get as slim as any other single compartment clamshell bag.  One thing that doesn't feel as bombproof as the rest is the zipper pulls, they seem to be some type of cloth, not braided nylon or rope.  Easily replaceable at least.  I do wish it had a luggage passthrough lol, but thats just me (I'd probably bring a smaller bag with rolling luggage tbh).  Any external molle or bottle pockets would sort of ruin its whole stripped down vibe (though if you need that stuff - that Greenroom Northseeker seems like pocketed alternative ).  I've actually replaced my expandable Knack pack medium with this in my \"keeper\" lineup.    \n\n\nI did get the hardback loop panel, and while its cool, I'm not sure about it personally, as the panel is fairly substantial and adds weight and stiffness.  The squared off shape of the backpack really is very efficient for usable packing volume vs weight.  I think people in the market for this sort of simple but tough type of bag should give it a good look, especially if you are the type thats hard on your gear but doesn't need/want any extra attachments to ruin the look.  If you want more features or a more skin/clothing friendly fabric, you may want to look elsewhere.  Otherwise if you are interested, I'd recommend signing up for their email list where they will bombard you with sales/coupon codes etc.  \n\n\nAs always happy to answer any questions about it.",

            "body": "I had preordered this bag during Black Friday sales week, but it didn't ship until late January (it seems to be in stock on their website now).  Like many people getting into the bag market, I had seen a lot of the square clamshel type bags that forego built in organization or neat feaures or tricks, in favor of a more overbuilt, tough as nails, type of proposition.  I had looked at Evergoods and GoRucks etc, and never really bit because of price (I'll only really bite on a good deal), weight, and some other considerations (I'm actually not much of a backpack guy, I'm more of a shoulder bag guy -slings/camera bags/man purses lol).  But the Recycled Firefighter was on the radar cause it seemed to be one of the lighter \"simple square\" backpacks and I do like supporting domestically made bags when possible.  After looking at Recycled Firefighters lineup I decided to go with their big 24hr+ as I could get more use out of a bigger backpack.  \n\n\nThis bag really won me over in the last few weeks, just handling it it feels tough (the 1000D will abrade your skin and clothes).  My own personal measurements of this bag when pretty full come out to be about 18.5\"x 12\"x 8\" which isn't quite the same as what the website lists, but comes out to be about 28-29L and there is plenty of fabric slack in the panels so you probably can overstuff this bag easily. The bag itself does not have much in the way of internal structure like many bags (comparing it to my 500D CT21 the bag walls and sides are softer on they 24hr+), but has a good bit of foam on the back and bottom, which provides most of the structure of the backpack.  The straps are nice and wide and padded, really comfy.  In use I love the compression straps coupled with the more supple side walls.  This bag is functionally expandable, as you can compress one of the unused compartments when not in use and as shown in pictures it will get as slim as any other single compartment clamshell bag.  One thing that doesn't feel as bombproof as the rest is the zipper pulls, they seem to be some type of cloth, not braided nylon or rope.  Easily replaceable at least.  I do wish it had a luggage passthrough lol, but thats just me (I'd probably bring a smaller bag with rolling luggage tbh).  Any external molle or bottle pockets would sort of ruin its whole stripped down vibe (though if you need that stuff - that Greenroom Northseeker seems like pocketed alternative ).  I've actually replaced my expandable Knack pack medium with this in my \"keeper\" lineup.    \n\n\nI did get the hardback loop panel, and while its cool, I'm not sure about it personally, as the panel is fairly substantial and adds weight and stiffness.  The squared off shape of the backpack really is very efficient for usable packing volume vs weight.  I think people in the market for this sort of simple but tough type of bag should give it a good look, especially if you are the type thats hard on your gear but doesn't need/want any extra attachments to ruin the look.  If you want more features or a more skin/clothing friendly fabric, you may want to look elsewhere.  Otherwise if you are interested, I'd recommend signing up for their email list where they will bombard you with sales/coupon codes etc.  \n\n\nAs always happy to answer any questions about it.",

            "body": "Thank you for your insights OP. I received the regular RFF 24 Hour, \\~20ish litres, in January and am also pleased for many of reasons the OP outlined. It's a tough, minimalist pack. A few observations that should also apply to the 24 HR+:\n\n* I like that the RFF 24's sternum strap is easily removed (and added back) as I wanted as few dangling  bits as possible for this bag.\n* All zippers, including those for the interior mesh compartments, are #10's but they're not YKK. The brand is not specified on the pulls or on RFF's website.\n* A few stray threads had to be snipped--not an issue with me.\n* Webbing handles, as strong as they may be, tend to lack structure. A [paracord wrap](https://imgur.com/a/DCeJnmw)  on the 24's top handle stands it up, improves hand hold, and optionally adds more lash points\n* When used for EDC I've taken to leaving my Chrome Organiser in the front pocket of the RFF 24. It's a versatile, modular solution for those wanting the organization of EDC in a minimalist travel pack (with a front, vertically zipped pocket). [Write up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/19eug1t/in_praise_of_chromes_messenger_organizer/).\n* I'm impressed with the shoulder straps. I do have bags with as much padding in the straps but the RFF, at 3 inches, has the widest straps of all my sub 50 litre bags. They distribute load over a greater area for improved comfort. The downside here is more trapped sweat under exertion.\n* I like the webbing and D rings on the harness. These low cost unobtrusive add-ons are all on the plus side.\n* As the OP mentioned: the exterior of this pack, all the contact points, are 1000D Cordura. So if prematurely wearing out your clothing is a concern, perhaps you should look elsewhere.\n* As per OP's observations on the RFF's (lack of) structure. Soft, semi-structured packs like the RFF with a discrete laptop compartment are ideal candidates for greater spinal fortitude by the addition of [Coroplast](https://www.google.com/search?q=Coroplast&amp;oq=Coroplast&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGDzSAQgxNzczajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) (4 mm corrugated plastic board, like cardboard). It's light, cheap, immune to soakings, tough, and slim enough that it will fit alongside a laptop, adding further protection. [Here's my RFF 24 accessorised with a Coroplast panel](https://imgur.com/a/skaXlju) liberated from a neighbourhood realtor's sign. Note: enhancing the RFF 24's rigidity this way is an option, not an indication it lacks sufficient structure. It's a soft pack, nothing wrong with that.\n\nThat's it for now. Cheers.",

A wrap on the handle would be nice if I used it more (or one of those Defy Mr. Grippers or Greenroom ones), I'll probably go without just to keep weight down.  Nice call on the Coroplast, I have seen people with Tom Bihns and the like talk about using that.  I haven't put enough weight in it to warrant more structure, but maybe I'd press that hook/loop backer into service.  I actually used it backwards in the front compartment to help the bag stand so I could get pictures of it (in lieu of stuffing with clothes or whatnot).  I do like the webbing on the straps too, I have an alpaka phone sleeve that would perfectly on there.  For the front pocket, I have a modern dayfarer tech pouch I'll probably use.  Nice and flat.",

            "body": "Had this one for awhile but didn't get to use it much till recently.  I probably didn't need this bag, but the yellowish sandstone Halley Stevensons hybrid wax canvas called to me.  Still I would not have bit if the price wasn't so good and it had some features uncommon with other waxed canvas options, so I it swayed me.\n\nThis bag uses Halley Stevensons Hybrid dry waxed canvas (only in this color), the other ones used the \"Alchemy\" cloth which is more \"wet\" and shows more \"pull up\" creasing.  This is more similar to the waxed canvas Trakke uses than the waxed canvas that that evergoods had used.  Other nice touches that are different from the standard CT21 (I own the leather fronted \"Banned\" so can compare) is this does have external bottle pockets that lay flat when not used with magnets, and the \"+\" version has a full clamshell panel on front like a GR2.  The main compartment does not have a laptop sleeve, but rather a full loop back, but this versions external laptop sleeve is not under the shoulder straps like on the normal CT21 (which is more goruck esque), but rather has a side laptop access zipper on one side and an identical looking zipper on the other side that reveals an side admin pocket.  Whats really nice is it has actual foam/mesh back padding, so the non-breathable waxed canvas is not in direct contact with your back (an not absorbing your sweat).  I actually like the lumbar pad on the bottom but the bag is right length for my back.  Unlike the goruck heritage bags this comes stock with nylon strapping on the shoulder straps which is nice cause I'm a mandatory sternum strap person.\n\nAll in all I really enjoy it, my most similar bag to it in size is the Alpha One Niner Evade 1.5 Stealth Cobra, that one has a little more depth in the main compartment but a slightly less deep admin section, Id say capacity is very similar, with the CT21+ maybe fitting slightly more cause of its less tapered shape.  The Recycled Firefighter 24hr+ is even more square is is much larger than those two.  If the AON 1.5 is 25L, the CT21+ is 26L and the RFF 24+ is probably 29L ish.  The AON and CT21+ are pretty heavy, I measure both at 4.3lb empty (the other 21+ alchemy's are prob heavier as the hybrid fabric is lighter), the RFF 24+ is like only 2.5lbs and has different “true” double decker layout, so is in a different category.  I'll probably keep both the stealth cobra (due to its unique origin) and the CT21+, but I actually probably have more black bags around this size that I want (and a fyro coming in) so if push came to shove I'd probably let go of the evade first (and AON is one of my top 3 makers all around along with Greenroom and Waterfield).\n\nMy collection is well past the point of me \"covering the bases\" in all my use cases and sizes, now its sort of getting cool stuff that I like.  If I don't really feel particularly attached to a bag, the price I'm willing to let it go for gets lower lol.  If I really like it I won't sell it, so I think I'll keep this one for now.  As always any questions just drop them, I'm happy to answer.",

I probably didn't need this bag, but the yellowish sandstone Halley Stevensons hybrid wax canvas called to me.  Still I would not have bit if the price wasn't so good and it had some features uncommon with other waxed canvas options, so I it swayed me.\n\nThis bag uses Halley Stevensons Hybrid dry waxed canvas (only in this color), the other ones used the \"Alchemy\" cloth which is more \"wet\" and shows more \"pull up\" creasing.  This is more similar to the waxed canvas Trakke uses than the waxed canvas that that evergoods had used.  Other nice touches that are different from the standard CT21 (I own the leather fronted \"Banned\" so can compare) is this does have external bottle pockets that lay flat when not used with magnets, and the \"+\" version has a full clamshell panel on front like a GR2.  The main compartment does not have a laptop sleeve, but rather a full loop back, but this versions external laptop sleeve is not under the shoulder straps like on the normal CT21 (which is more goruck esque), but rather has a side laptop access zipper on one side and an identical looking zipper on the other side that reveals an side admin pocket.  Whats really nice is it has actual foam/mesh back padding, so the non-breathable waxed canvas is not in direct contact with your back (an not absorbing your sweat).  I actually like the lumbar pad on the bottom but the bag is right length for my back.  Unlike the goruck heritage bags this comes stock with nylon strapping on the shoulder straps which is nice cause I'm a mandatory sternum strap person.\n\nAll in all I really enjoy it, my most similar bag to it in size is the Alpha One Niner Evade 1.5 Stealth Cobra, that one has a little more depth in the main compartment but a slightly less deep admin section, Id say capacity is very similar, with the CT21+ maybe fitting slightly more cause of its less tapered shape.  The Recycled Firefighter 24hr+ is even more square is is much larger than those two.  If the AON 1.5 is 25L, the CT21+ is 26L and the RFF 24+ is probably 29L ish.  The AON and CT21+ are pretty heavy, I measure both at 4.3lb empty (the other 21+ alchemy's are prob heavier as the hybrid fabric is lighter), the RFF 24+ is like only 2.5lbs and has different “true” double decker layout, so is in a different category.  I'll probably keep both the stealth cobra (due to its unique origin) and the CT21+, but I actually probably have more black bags around this size that I want (and a fyro coming in) so if push came to shove I'd probably let go of the evade first (and AON is one of my top 3 makers all around along with Greenroom and Waterfield).\n\nMy collection is well past the point of me \"covering the bases\" in all my use cases and sizes, now its sort of getting cool stuff that I like.  If I don't really feel particularly attached to a bag, the price I'm willing to let it go for gets lower lol.  If I really like it I won't sell it, so I think I'll keep this one for now.  As always any questions just drop them, I'm happy to answer.",

I probably didn't need this bag, but the yellowish sandstone Halley Stevensons hybrid wax canvas called to me.  Still I would not have bit if the price wasn't so good and it had some features uncommon with other waxed canvas options, so I it swayed me.\n\nThis bag uses Halley Stevensons Hybrid dry waxed canvas (only in this color), the other ones used the \"Alchemy\" cloth which is more \"wet\" and shows more \"pull up\" creasing.  This is more similar to the waxed canvas Trakke uses than the waxed canvas that that evergoods had used.  Other nice touches that are different from the standard CT21 (I own the leather fronted \"Banned\" so can compare) is this does have external bottle pockets that lay flat when not used with magnets, and the \"+\" version has a full clamshell panel on front like a GR2.  The main compartment does not have a laptop sleeve, but rather a full loop back, but this versions external laptop sleeve is not under the shoulder straps like on the normal CT21 (which is more goruck esque), but rather has a side laptop access zipper on one side and an identical looking zipper on the other side that reveals an side admin pocket.  Whats really nice is it has actual foam/mesh back padding, so the non-breathable waxed canvas is not in direct contact with your back (an not absorbing your sweat).  I actually like the lumbar pad on the bottom but the bag is right length for my back.  Unlike the goruck heritage bags this comes stock with nylon strapping on the shoulder straps which is nice cause I'm a mandatory sternum strap person.\n\nAll in all I really enjoy it, my most similar bag to it in size is the Alpha One Niner Evade 1.5 Stealth Cobra, that one has a little more depth in the main compartment but a slightly less deep admin section, Id say capacity is very similar, with the CT21+ maybe fitting slightly more cause of its less tapered shape.  The Recycled Firefighter 24hr+ is even more square is is much larger than those two.  If the AON 1.5 is 25L, the CT21+ is 26L and the RFF 24+ is probably 29L ish.  The AON and CT21+ are pretty heavy, I measure both at 4.3lb empty (the other 21+ alchemy's are prob heavier as the hybrid fabric is lighter), the RFF 24+ is like only 2.5lbs and has different “true” double decker layout, so is in a different category.  I'll probably keep both the stealth cobra (due to its unique origin) and the CT21+, but I actually probably have more black bags around this size that I want (and a fyro coming in) so if push came to shove I'd probably let go of the evade first (and AON is one of my top 3 makers all around along with Greenroom and Waterfield).\n\nMy collection is well past the point of me \"covering the bases\" in all my use cases and sizes, now its sort of getting cool stuff that I like.  If I don't really feel particularly attached to a bag, the price I'm willing to let it go for gets lower lol.  If I really like it I won't sell it, so I think I'll keep this one for now.

I'll probably add a sternum strap. \n* I decided not to add water bottle pockets since they would be too small. \n\nThe binding on this pack is worse, but it's on the inside so it's fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Materials**\n\n* 500D Multicam Black Cordura  nylon\n* 1000D Cordura nylon\n* 220D orange nylon\n* 17337 1-inch and 2-inch  webbing\n* \\#9 reverse coil zipper \n* 3/8 Eva foam \n* 3 mm eva foam \n* 3/4 gros grain ribbon.",

My copy did not come with a shoulder strap, but I have plenty of those so threw a TB absolute on there.  At 42L its a step up in size from my smaller Blue Claw and Bespoke Post Weekenders and the Tomtoc T31 I posted about.  Its a nice old fashioned, very light, and very unstructured, duffel.  It has its own unique wrinkle, which is the very very wide opening main zipper, and the triple zip pockets on the front.  No luggage pass through on this one, so its not on airport duty unless its by itself.  I actually like it a lot.  The pictures tell most of the story here.\n\nWith this Duffel, I finally have the opportunity to compare the \"old\" and \"new\" RF build quality firsthand.  Compared to my \\~January example of the RF 24+ which I've posted about a few times I can say there is a difference in materials, but overall build is pretty much the same.  The stitching on both my RF bags have been pretty good, I've seen way worse.  My seams and stitches all pretty much line up and I don't have any hanging threads, so it was at least cleaned up prior to shipping.  The material on both of my bags feels pretty light, but the older bag's material  feels softer, and the underside of the fabric has a sort of tacky/sticky sort of feel.  In contrast the fabric on the newer bag is like scratchy, sort of abrasive, the underside feels the same as the face. I don't know if thats a different sort of coating or if its just raw nylon. It also may be just age, but it definitely feels like there is a different coating on either sides on the older model. I believe most fabric is coated (DWR usually, PVC sometimes etc.) before sewn, which is part of why different batches of cordura always feels different which is well documented on gorucks over time.  (i'm going to add a fabric weave tangent at the end of this as to other reasons both these fabric feels thin, aside from coatings)\n\nA few weeks back the owner of RF posted on Instagram that there were some quality issues earlier this year when he started using a few other workshops to make some of his bags (those makers he says are still in the USA, despite speculation he took it overseas).  It seems my new RF bag was one of the ones without problems.  So it seems like the build quality can vary on the new ones.  My new bag is sewn together just as good (might be better than ) as the old one, which did have lose threads (but that may be due to use and age).  The materials definitely seem to be different (not as good feeling) on the newer bags.  The fabric doesn't feel any lighter though, so it still seems to be 1000D just with a lighter (or nonexistant) treatment.  The actual Zippers are just as good, but zipper pulls are way better on the old one (they are nice paracord, new ones its like shoelace). Nylon webbing seems to be the same and box stitches on handles etc. seem to be the same.\n\nAnyways, as always happy to answer any questions etc.  \n\n\nThis is my fabric nerd tangent-  Aside from the coatings I mentioned,  I think the reasons the RF fabric feels so light is it mostly uses only a single layer plain weave for areas of these bags.  There isn't much in the way of the inner structure, its just the outer fabric and and liner (some places are unlined, with occasionally some thin padding (backpack back/bottom and duffel bottom).  Plain weave fabrics will feel thin compared to fabrics which are woven in a 3D jacquard (usually backetweave) pattern which gives the fabric a little more self structure, and that nice texture, the Aer 1680D or Tom Bihn nylons are a good example of this texture.  Even a twill weave will have a less floppy hand (I was a suit fabric nut so I'm into this nerdy stuff lol).  Cordura also makes non-plain weave fabrics and ballistic type fabrics too, so one \"Cordura\" you may have felt before will not feel the same.",

            "body": "I was able get a good deal on a used Recycled Firefighter 72-Hour Duffel.  I'm actually more of a duffel person than a backpack person, and this one is pretty good.  My copy did not come with a shoulder strap, but I have plenty of those so threw a TB absolute on there.  At 42L its a step up in size from my smaller Blue Claw and Bespoke Post Weekenders and the Tomtoc T31 I posted about.  Its a nice old fashioned, very light, and very unstructured, duffel.  It has its own unique wrinkle, which is the very very wide opening main zipper, and the triple zip pockets on the front.  No luggage pass through on this one, so its not on airport duty unless its by itself.  I actually like it a lot.  The pictures tell most of the story here.\n\nWith this Duffel, I finally have the opportunity to compare the \"old\" and \"new\" RF build quality firsthand.  Compared to my \\~January example of the RF 24+ which I've posted about a few times I can say there is a difference in materials, but overall build is pretty much the same.  The stitching on both my RF bags have been pretty good, I've seen way worse.  My seams and stitches all pretty much line up and I don't have any hanging threads, so it was at least cleaned up prior to shipping.  The material on both of my bags feels pretty light, but the older bag's material  feels softer, and the underside of the fabric has a sort of tacky/sticky sort of feel.  In contrast the fabric on the newer bag is like scratchy, sort of abrasive, the underside feels the same as the face. I don't know if thats a different sort of coating or if its just raw nylon. It also may be just age, but it definitely feels like there is a different coating on either sides on the older model. I believe most fabric is coated (DWR usually, PVC sometimes etc.) before sewn, which is part of why different batches of cordura always feels different which is well documented on gorucks over time.  (i'm going to add a fabric weave tangent at the end of this as to other reasons both these fabric feels thin, aside from coatings)\n\nA few weeks back the owner of RF posted on Instagram that there were some quality issues earlier this year when he started using a few other workshops to make some of his bags (those makers he says are still in the USA, despite speculation he took it overseas).  It seems my new RF bag was one of the ones without problems.  So it seems like the build quality can vary on the new ones.  My new bag is sewn together just as good (might be better than ) as the old one, which did have lose threads (but that may be due to use and age).  The materials definitely seem to be different (not as good feeling) on the newer bags.  The fabric doesn't feel any lighter though, so it still seems to be 1000D just with a lighter (or nonexistant) treatment.  The actual Zippers are just as good, but zipper pulls are way better on the old one (they are nice paracord, new ones its like shoelace). Nylon webbing seems to be the same and box stitches on handles etc. seem to be the same.\n\nAnyways, as always happy to answer any questions etc.  \n\n\nThis is my fabric nerd tangent-  Aside from the coatings I mentioned,  I think the reasons the RF fabric feels so light is it mostly uses only a single layer plain weave for areas of these bags.  There isn't much in the way of the inner structure, its just the outer fabric and and liner (some places are unlined, with occasionally some thin padding (backpack back/bottom and duffel bottom).  Plain weave fabrics will feel thin compared to fabrics which are woven in a 3D jacquard (usually backetweave) pattern which gives the fabric a little more self structure, and that nice texture, the Aer 1680D or Tom Bihn nylons are a good example of this texture.  Even a twill weave will have a less floppy hand (I was a suit fabric nut so I'm into this nerdy stuff lol).  Cordura also makes non-plain weave fabrics and ballistic type fabrics too, so one \"Cordura\" you may have felt before will not feel the same.",

                "body": "Thanks for the comparison of materials. I think the owner could just clarify he's still using high quality USA materials. Most of the bad comments are about not knowing if the quality now is worse off than the old ones. \n\n\nHow would you rate the single layer of 1000D on the bags? Do you think it's going to be durable? I'll love a duffel for army or surfing trips but don't think it'll hold up to that much roughing up",

It's not as great as Mystery Ranch, which is the best harness system I've used, but it's a step up from, say, my CT15. I'm guessing once I break it in it will be easier to use, and the weight I mentioned above will sit easier on my back/shoulders.\n\n\n\nThe main compartment is a lot roomier than I thought it would be, even with the large Bookpouch.

I underestimated how heavy it would be fully packed out...really kicking myself for not thinking of a hip belt until after I ordered. I've had a 22L bag that wasn't too heavy, but I've never had a backpack from them, I didn't know how overbuilt they can be. If they can't add one I just might try to jury rig something myself.",

Love that it’s clamshell, 15L, two side compartments and the front pocket has its own volume (the Owala 24oz, does not fit on the side compartment). So happy I got this as my daypack!  \n\n\nPs. I got the Armor 08 to come so I can put my Owala 24oz outside rather than the front pocket.  Waiting for it to arrive on Sunday.",

It's a little taller than the standard personal item specs, but it has a soft frame and can be squished into a smaller size. The hype is real: it weighs nothing, it has mostly a minimalist look, the stretch pockets are v impressive, the main compartment is huge. But as I sat with it over the next couple of days, a couple of things started to bother me: the crinkle of the ULTRA fabric was loud and visible even after smoothing out, how big it looked on me (I'm 5'4\" and my torso is \\~18\"), and the price tag ($255 USD all in).\n\nAs I wasn't 100% sold, I revisiting the initial thread and started searching again. I realized I was v drawn to the minimalist, sleek look, a la GoRuck, but not at those prices. I found the RF 24 HR backpack as an alternative to the GR1 and watched every YouTube video I could find featuring it. It's currently sold out in black, so got it used for a great price and in great condition for \\~$130.\n\n**Some pros**: it's v close to the GR1, and the flat profile was big draw (worn on crowded NYC subway without hitting anyone). It weighs 1lb 14oz, 2 roomy mesh organizer pouches, sternum strap, v smooth #10 YKK reverse zippers, 2\" grab handle (improvement on ULA Ultra Dragonfly), v thick shoulder straps, can hold 3 medium packing cubes, 4.5 medium cubes if needed. It's more spacious than it looks. I've used as a casual daypack, for some heavy hauling, and for a trip. It's comfortable, durable, beautifully measured and stitched (in more backpacks than not, the cutting and/or stitching is wonky).\n\n**Some cons**: the padded back panel (where the laptop sits), while soft and supportive, also gets hot. The 1000D Cordura Nylon is tough but gets dirty easily. If you drag it around, it'll show. It droops a bit if it's v heavy.\n\nI'm v happy with the 24 HR backpack. While the Dragonfly is a great option and a community darling (for good reason), ultimately, the look and size, in person, just felt clunky for me to use as EDC and travel bag, and a great price. I hope this helps anyone else looking for something similar.",

The flag patch is the dimmest. The FFT patch while ok, seems to fall in the middle. Dont get me wrong, the other patches are satisfactory, the EG patch is just the most obnoxious, for the lack of a better word?\n\nWith the FFT patch side by side to the EG patch, its still a touch dimmer. And bummed the FFT patch’s orange fields aren’t reflective like the accompanying EG orange patch.\n\nMy only prob with the EG patch is the lack of “movement” or the sameness of the shape to other background sources of light. Then again, its still can be pretty obnoxious as light sources get closer and thats what i want.\n\nNot sure where Kev &amp; co are sourcing their patches but keep it up.",
