        "selftext": "So I got my first north face back in early 2019. So I’m not talking about models before 2018. Im sure the older ones were way better. This is strictly about the 2018 vs post 2021 bags. \n\nIt was the recon not the Borealis (the picture in this post isn’t mine) but I know that aside from the front pocket vs the strings they’re the same design on the inside. A few weeks ago I got the newer borealis one cause I always wanted the Borealis and regretted not getting that one in the first place and I wanted a newer bag to carry around for work (I got the recon for college initially and it was always super heavy to carry around honestly even with little things in it).\n\nI gotta say I enjoy this newer model much better! The material is lighter, less bulky, the pockets in the front are bigger, it’s exponentially easier to fit things in the main pocket! While the newer one still has some issue with the middle section kind of caving in (if you have one of these you know what I mean) it’s not nearly as bad as it was with my 2019 recon. I always had to make sure to put my bulky items in the bottom or nothing would fit. This newer bag (while still have a very slight issue with that) is much, much improved in my opinion. It’s also much more comfortable on me but that may just because it’s a lighter material. I’ve seen on this and other subs that people tend to hate the newer models of the north face bag and like the ones from 2018. But honestly the only thing i preferred about the older one was the water bottle pockets cause they were a little more flexible. Other than that i really prefer this newer model much more",

I compared it to the newer style recon and absolutely hate them. I treat it with loving kindness, because once it tears, it will be no more. I have used it so much that the elastic in the water bottle nets on either side have stretched out to the point that they do not have any more elasticity left.",
