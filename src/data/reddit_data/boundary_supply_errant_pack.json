            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

Not only it means that it will dirty faster, but it also isn't waterproof from the bottom: a bummer, seeing as I took Prima snowboarding and was perfectly fine.  \nAlso....**loops**. The sheer amount of nipple clips, snaps, loops and hoops in and out is honestly too much. I am a big fan of accessories and carry a strapped EDC torchlight and carabiner or two on my bagpack, but the Errant Pro just has so many things that while not getting in the way (well...so far. I think the loop in the front hatch pocket will annoy me), just take a little space and form a question mark in my head everytime I see it. Like the elastic loops on the velcro inner in the main compartment. The fabric loops that are on the backside of the main compartment, normally covered by a divider.  \nThe snap buttons that don't even fit my Port kit from Boundary Supply, inside and up. The multitude of small loops on the outside.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

Not only it means that it will dirty faster, but it also isn't waterproof from the bottom: a bummer, seeing as I took Prima snowboarding and was perfectly fine.  \nAlso....**loops**. The sheer amount of nipple clips, snaps, loops and hoops in and out is honestly too much. I am a big fan of accessories and carry a strapped EDC torchlight and carabiner or two on my bagpack, but the Errant Pro just has so many things that while not getting in the way (well...so far. I think the loop in the front hatch pocket will annoy me), just take a little space and form a question mark in my head everytime I see it. Like the elastic loops on the velcro inner in the main compartment. The fabric loops that are on the backside of the main compartment, normally covered by a divider.  \nThe snap buttons that don't even fit my Port kit from Boundary Supply, inside and up. The multitude of small loops on the outside.",

            "body": "Hey everyone, just got this in the mail and wanted to give my first impressions. I'll do a full review soon, but in the meantime, here's my initial thoughts after playing with it for an hour...\n\n**Size**\n\nThe original Errant is a 22L that looks a bit more like a 20L, and similarly, the Errant Pro is a 30L that looks a bit more like a 27L.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe Pro has some really impressive expansion as to where it def packs like 30 liters. It's just important to know that if it's not fully packed out, the bag will flatten and have a bit of a pancake-ier look to it.\n\n**Weight**\n\nAlthough I thought it would feel a bit heaver, 4.65 lbs is still aggressive.\n\nHaving said that, I commend Boundary for sticking to their guns - they went balls to the wall with this pack - and bc of that they knew it was going to be heavy and therefore not for everyone (cough, onebaggers).\n\n**Look**\n\nI think the original Errant could be the best looking pack on the market. It’s so distinct and noticeable while also having some subtlety - a perfect mashup between futuristic and heritage.\n\nBut the Pro takes the look to the next level - especially in X Pac. Wearing this felt cyberpunk af, and I think Boundary knows this, hence why lots of their marketing materials for this pack have dudes on motorcycles and standing next to jets.\n\nIt’s intentional, and in my opinion it works really well.\n\n**Colors**\n\nI’m not really crazy about the look of X Pac, but the grey grew on me. Wish they had a green X Pac like the new limited edition Modern Dayfarer.\n\n**Materials**\n\nI totally get anyone saying this bag is too heavy or is over-engineered, but one thing you cannot deny is that Boundary gives their bags some of the best materials money can buy.\n\nPersonally, I love the Nywool material used in the top pocket, and the tech compartment. I haven't seen many bags use this material and I think it's really cool looking and offers a unique UX.\n\n**Divider**\n\nI'm not really crazy about the divider, which is why I'm stoked that it's removable. You can also upgrade to the Premium Divider Wall (which I have), but using the shoe compartment will severely compromise your space and accessibility.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nI'm not really crazy about Boundary's comfort - their shoulder straps have a tendency to be too course for my taste. But I loaded the pack out and wore it for a bit - the load lifters were very effective and well designed. Waist strap and sternum strap did their job.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nLike I said, this is just a first impression. Full review coming soon. Let me know if you have any questions, I'd love to help.",

            "body": "So I received my Obsidian Black Errant Pro today. Adding my initial impression of it, minus the full size MK-1 LT camera cube as it arrives tomorrow. It arrived in a nice bag that will definitely be useable for other things, so that’s a nice touch. The material appears durable and feels really rugged. It definitely has a sleek, modern aesthetic which I like a lot. I like the fact it doesn’t look like a camera bag. In all black it totally looks like something black ops Navy SEALS would be using. The combination of the matte black Cordura and the satin is straight up bad ass.\n\n[Errant Pro Photo Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/DreVuop)\n\nThe pack arrived flat from shipping so I filled it with towels to build it’s shape back. I tried it on partially filled and then fully packed to the brim, which you can see from the photos I’ve attached. My wife also put it on in a photo, she’s 5’,7” and a small build. I’m a somewhat slender 5’,9” build. When it’s fully packed to the brim, it does feel slightly large on my back, but not too bad. I really like the fact that I could remove the waist straps as well. (FYI - my photos don’t show the waist straps, and the two bottom straps don’t hang down like they do in my photos, they do cinch up properly). \n\nThe interior organization is well thought out. I will be using the pockets and slot for my 12.9” iPad Pro and accessories, which fit great with the Magic Keyboard attached. The interior divider is great and I like that you can swap it out for the travel one or remove it completely. On the exterior, the two main magnetic clasps are solid and are easy to close and unlatch. It was easy to get into the side door and top of the pack.\n\nI will definitely say this is a techies pack. It has pockets, straps, and slots all over the place. I like that kind of thing so it fits me very well. My wife even pointed that out when she saw it. If you’re into minimalism, this isn’t the pack for you. The side door is a large opening so for now (until the camera cube arrives tomorrow), my larger body D800 camera can fit easily though it. I’ll provide more camera specific feedback on that tomorrow. As far as weight it is a heavier pack, but not nearly as bad as I was thinking it would be. Keep in mind I haven’t had a chance to try it out with the cube and my camera gear, so we’ll see how that goes.\n\nIn the photos I compare it to my SuperDry backpack, which is a standard school book bag size pack. Both packed with towels. I also held a measuring tape up to it to see the size fully packed to the brim. \n\nThe only negative to me so far is the X-PAC option, which it appears to be VX21 and is the reason I chose the Cordura. It is too noisy (crinkly) for my liking. Had this pack been been produced in a VX42 X-PAC and in black, I'd have been all over it. I have some Alpaka gear made of it and it's durable, quiet and awesome. The Cordura version I have is still super nice though, and looks to last. I took some closeup shots so you can see the texture of the materials. \n\nOverall my initial impression of the pack is that I really like it. Sure it’s a tiny bit on the heavy side, but it’s definitely not intolerable and I’m a smaller guy. Now this is prior to receiving the camera cube and placing all my gear in it. My thoughts might change tomorrow once I do that, but I’m leaning towards keeping it and enjoying it a lot. I love the amount of organization in it and the modularity is awesome. To be able to use it as a daily EDC, (which you can definitely do), and then use it for travel or convert it to full camera pack, makes it one bad ass backpack. For right now I absolutely love it, so it’s really just up to the photography aspect of it as to whether I keep it.",

Not only it means that it will dirty faster, but it also isn't waterproof from the bottom: a bummer, seeing as I took Prima snowboarding and was perfectly fine.  \nAlso....**loops**. The sheer amount of nipple clips, snaps, loops and hoops in and out is honestly too much. I am a big fan of accessories and carry a strapped EDC torchlight and carabiner or two on my bagpack, but the Errant Pro just has so many things that while not getting in the way (well...so far. I think the loop in the front hatch pocket will annoy me), just take a little space and form a question mark in my head everytime I see it. Like the elastic loops on the velcro inner in the main compartment. The fabric loops that are on the backside of the main compartment, normally covered by a divider.  \nThe snap buttons that don't even fit my Port kit from Boundary Supply, inside and up. The multitude of small loops on the outside.",

            "body": "I got two new slings in the other day and I already posted about the other one. The Kargo Loculus was a real pleasant surprise, its actually much larger than I expected but has a lot of details that are really well done. I'll compare it with my other big slings (you can see I have a lot).  \n\nStarting off with construction and materials, this thing feels really good, it reminds me of my Defy Insidious in feel and construction, tough. While the Defy has more premium materials, the \"feel\" is the same and the Loculus has by far and away the better interior design (interior zip pockets, of differing size!) and back/bottom padding. I wish the Insidious was like this as far as the bottom padding and the tech sleeve construction (the toggle clasp is just a great detail). The white Xpac looks and feels great. This thing has some built in structure (I suspect its the same no matter what material you choose) and keeps it shape, so will recover if compressed.  \n\nOn the body, it wears a lot like a mini Insidious (or Chrome Kadet, Metrorunner etc.), with that nice \"diagonal on the back/horizontal slung to the front\" sort of usage. The Insidious still has the best shoulder strap I've used and is still the most comfortable to wear, but the Loculus is no slouch. The Loculus's strap foam is really good and molds to the shape of the body (unlike other stiffer foams that want to stay straight).  This strap can even fold away, but its slightly too long to fit well (this is good to me though as many slings of this type, the padded portion is too short).  Having a handle on the sling is nice, just for handling.  The only nitpick I have on the whole bag is the little strap dangle stopper is not elastic and is too big and loose, so just slides around.  This is the same sorta strap keeper that Greenroom uses, not a fan, even a plastic one would be nicer if they want to avoid elastic.  \n\nFor use case, its most similar in size and shape to the Bellroy Venture 10L. The Loculus is listed as 5.5L and thats probably right, the Venture 10L in reality is more like 6 or 6.5L. So similar in shape, but Venture is deeper and opens much wider for easier access to cameras and functionally it wears lower and looser to the body, which works better for heavier camera stuff anyway. You can probably fit mirrorless camera gear in the Loculus, but the zippers and generally tougher materials in there I'd generally keep away from glass elements and screens etc., the Venture is constructed with that sort of use in mind anyway. There is no real use case overlap, so I'll keep both lol.  \n\nI really like it, and I'd recommend it. I was cross shopping the Metrorunner and Chrome Kadet/Mini but really liked the color choices on the Loculus and having it domestically made with such good prices is a big plus for me. I was considering the Blue Grid ripstop one too, but I've been wanting a white xpac anything so when it came back in stock I pulled the trigger. I'd sign up for their mailing list to get that discount code if you are looking. On the pictures it looks ok, but I really have to express how nice and well built this thing feels in the hand. Not every bag feels like that. ",

Here is where I landed:\n\n* Large \"Gone for the Day\" Sling - Kargo Loculus 5.7L (13\" x 6\" x 4.5\" at 19 oz)\n* Medium EDC/Travel Sling - TomToc Aviator T33 3.5L (11.4\" x 5.9\" x 3.4\" at 11 oz)\n* Small \"Pocket Reliever\" Sling - Bellroy Venture Ready 2.5L (8.7\" x 5.9\" x 3\" at 7 oz)\n\nAll work well.  The two smaller, packable slings have 3 different zippered compartments, including one close to the body for valuables.  I made this a requirement ([that pocket is necessary for travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35SwakZgfPU&amp;t=285s)), so this ruled out a bunch of bags including the Bellroy 6L.  Even the Loculus has a hidden back compartment that can be used as a pocket or to stash the strap.\n\nI shied away from taller slings as I don't carry iPads or laptop style tech in a sling.  Without taller items to carry, I find the extra height wasted in taller slings as everything falls to the bottom.  I have a smaller EDC/personal item backpack (GoRuck Bullet Double Compartment) with a laptop compartment.  \n\nEach of these slings meet my carry preference, riding more vertically on my back and more horizontally when slung around to the front.\n\nCompleting the circle, I found I liked the Bellroy Venture 2.5L slightly better than the Alpaka Tech Mini in the small category. It's just a little larger and easier to access.",

            "body": "I got two new slings in the other day and I already posted about the other one. The Kargo Loculus was a real pleasant surprise, its actually much larger than I expected but has a lot of details that are really well done. I'll compare it with my other big slings (you can see I have a lot).  \n\nStarting off with construction and materials, this thing feels really good, it reminds me of my Defy Insidious in feel and construction, tough. While the Defy has more premium materials, the \"feel\" is the same and the Loculus has by far and away the better interior design (interior zip pockets, of differing size!) and back/bottom padding. I wish the Insidious was like this as far as the bottom padding and the tech sleeve construction (the toggle clasp is just a great detail). The white Xpac looks and feels great. This thing has some built in structure (I suspect its the same no matter what material you choose) and keeps it shape, so will recover if compressed.  \n\nOn the body, it wears a lot like a mini Insidious (or Chrome Kadet, Metrorunner etc.), with that nice \"diagonal on the back/horizontal slung to the front\" sort of usage. The Insidious still has the best shoulder strap I've used and is still the most comfortable to wear, but the Loculus is no slouch. The Loculus's strap foam is really good and molds to the shape of the body (unlike other stiffer foams that want to stay straight).  This strap can even fold away, but its slightly too long to fit well (this is good to me though as many slings of this type, the padded portion is too short).  Having a handle on the sling is nice, just for handling.  The only nitpick I have on the whole bag is the little strap dangle stopper is not elastic and is too big and loose, so just slides around.  This is the same sorta strap keeper that Greenroom uses, not a fan, even a plastic one would be nicer if they want to avoid elastic.  \n\nFor use case, its most similar in size and shape to the Bellroy Venture 10L. The Loculus is listed as 5.5L and thats probably right, the Venture 10L in reality is more like 6 or 6.5L. So similar in shape, but Venture is deeper and opens much wider for easier access to cameras and functionally it wears lower and looser to the body, which works better for heavier camera stuff anyway. You can probably fit mirrorless camera gear in the Loculus, but the zippers and generally tougher materials in there I'd generally keep away from glass elements and screens etc., the Venture is constructed with that sort of use in mind anyway. There is no real use case overlap, so I'll keep both lol.  \n\nI really like it, and I'd recommend it. I was cross shopping the Metrorunner and Chrome Kadet/Mini but really liked the color choices on the Loculus and having it domestically made with such good prices is a big plus for me. I was considering the Blue Grid ripstop one too, but I've been wanting a white xpac anything so when it came back in stock I pulled the trigger. I'd sign up for their mailing list to get that discount code if you are looking. On the pictures it looks ok, but I really have to express how nice and well built this thing feels in the hand. Not every bag feels like that. ",

            "body": "I got two new slings in the other day and I already posted about the other one. The Kargo Loculus was a real pleasant surprise, its actually much larger than I expected but has a lot of details that are really well done. I'll compare it with my other big slings (you can see I have a lot).  \n\nStarting off with construction and materials, this thing feels really good, it reminds me of my Defy Insidious in feel and construction, tough. While the Defy has more premium materials, the \"feel\" is the same and the Loculus has by far and away the better interior design (interior zip pockets, of differing size!) and back/bottom padding. I wish the Insidious was like this as far as the bottom padding and the tech sleeve construction (the toggle clasp is just a great detail). The white Xpac looks and feels great. This thing has some built in structure (I suspect its the same no matter what material you choose) and keeps it shape, so will recover if compressed.  \n\nOn the body, it wears a lot like a mini Insidious (or Chrome Kadet, Metrorunner etc.), with that nice \"diagonal on the back/horizontal slung to the front\" sort of usage. The Insidious still has the best shoulder strap I've used and is still the most comfortable to wear, but the Loculus is no slouch. The Loculus's strap foam is really good and molds to the shape of the body (unlike other stiffer foams that want to stay straight).  This strap can even fold away, but its slightly too long to fit well (this is good to me though as many slings of this type, the padded portion is too short).  Having a handle on the sling is nice, just for handling.  The only nitpick I have on the whole bag is the little strap dangle stopper is not elastic and is too big and loose, so just slides around.  This is the same sorta strap keeper that Greenroom uses, not a fan, even a plastic one would be nicer if they want to avoid elastic.  \n\nFor use case, its most similar in size and shape to the Bellroy Venture 10L. The Loculus is listed as 5.5L and thats probably right, the Venture 10L in reality is more like 6 or 6.5L. So similar in shape, but Venture is deeper and opens much wider for easier access to cameras and functionally it wears lower and looser to the body, which works better for heavier camera stuff anyway. You can probably fit mirrorless camera gear in the Loculus, but the zippers and generally tougher materials in there I'd generally keep away from glass elements and screens etc., the Venture is constructed with that sort of use in mind anyway. There is no real use case overlap, so I'll keep both lol.  \n\nI really like it, and I'd recommend it. I was cross shopping the Metrorunner and Chrome Kadet/Mini but really liked the color choices on the Loculus and having it domestically made with such good prices is a big plus for me. I was considering the Blue Grid ripstop one too, but I've been wanting a white xpac anything so when it came back in stock I pulled the trigger. I'd sign up for their mailing list to get that discount code if you are looking. On the pictures it looks ok, but I really have to express how nice and well built this thing feels in the hand. Not every bag feels like that. ",

            "body": "I got two new slings in the other day and I already posted about the other one. The Kargo Loculus was a real pleasant surprise, its actually much larger than I expected but has a lot of details that are really well done. I'll compare it with my other big slings (you can see I have a lot).  \n\nStarting off with construction and materials, this thing feels really good, it reminds me of my Defy Insidious in feel and construction, tough. While the Defy has more premium materials, the \"feel\" is the same and the Loculus has by far and away the better interior design (interior zip pockets, of differing size!) and back/bottom padding. I wish the Insidious was like this as far as the bottom padding and the tech sleeve construction (the toggle clasp is just a great detail). The white Xpac looks and feels great. This thing has some built in structure (I suspect its the same no matter what material you choose) and keeps it shape, so will recover if compressed.  \n\nOn the body, it wears a lot like a mini Insidious (or Chrome Kadet, Metrorunner etc.), with that nice \"diagonal on the back/horizontal slung to the front\" sort of usage. The Insidious still has the best shoulder strap I've used and is still the most comfortable to wear, but the Loculus is no slouch. The Loculus's strap foam is really good and molds to the shape of the body (unlike other stiffer foams that want to stay straight).  This strap can even fold away, but its slightly too long to fit well (this is good to me though as many slings of this type, the padded portion is too short).  Having a handle on the sling is nice, just for handling.  The only nitpick I have on the whole bag is the little strap dangle stopper is not elastic and is too big and loose, so just slides around.  This is the same sorta strap keeper that Greenroom uses, not a fan, even a plastic one would be nicer if they want to avoid elastic.  \n\nFor use case, its most similar in size and shape to the Bellroy Venture 10L. The Loculus is listed as 5.5L and thats probably right, the Venture 10L in reality is more like 6 or 6.5L. So similar in shape, but Venture is deeper and opens much wider for easier access to cameras and functionally it wears lower and looser to the body, which works better for heavier camera stuff anyway. You can probably fit mirrorless camera gear in the Loculus, but the zippers and generally tougher materials in there I'd generally keep away from glass elements and screens etc., the Venture is constructed with that sort of use in mind anyway. There is no real use case overlap, so I'll keep both lol.  \n\nI really like it, and I'd recommend it. I was cross shopping the Metrorunner and Chrome Kadet/Mini but really liked the color choices on the Loculus and having it domestically made with such good prices is a big plus for me. I was considering the Blue Grid ripstop one too, but I've been wanting a white xpac anything so when it came back in stock I pulled the trigger. I'd sign up for their mailing list to get that discount code if you are looking. On the pictures it looks ok, but I really have to express how nice and well built this thing feels in the hand. Not every bag feels like that. ",

Here is where I landed:\n\n* Large \"Gone for the Day\" Sling - Kargo Loculus 5.7L (13\" x 6\" x 4.5\" at 19 oz)\n* Medium EDC/Travel Sling - TomToc Aviator T33 3.5L (11.4\" x 5.9\" x 3.4\" at 11 oz)\n* Small \"Pocket Reliever\" Sling - Bellroy Venture Ready 2.5L (8.7\" x 5.9\" x 3\" at 7 oz)\n\nAll work well.  The two smaller, packable slings have 3 different zippered compartments, including one close to the body for valuables.  I made this a requirement ([that pocket is necessary for travel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35SwakZgfPU&amp;t=285s)), so this ruled out a bunch of bags including the Bellroy 6L.  Even the Loculus has a hidden back compartment that can be used as a pocket or to stash the strap.\n\nI shied away from taller slings as I don't carry iPads or laptop style tech in a sling.  Without taller items to carry, I find the extra height wasted in taller slings as everything falls to the bottom.  I have a smaller EDC/personal item backpack (GoRuck Bullet Double Compartment) with a laptop compartment.  \n\nEach of these slings meet my carry preference, riding more vertically on my back and more horizontally when slung around to the front.\n\nCompleting the circle, I found I liked the Bellroy Venture 2.5L slightly better than the Alpaka Tech Mini in the small category.

If you're mostly just hanging about urban areas, can cope with getting wet and don't mind popping back to your hostel to change, you'll probably manage showers, and certainly you'll be able to thrift a coat.

Still not sure what the weather will look like since it's spring and it varies. it's going to be mostly city touring with lots of walking, but with a bit more outdoorsy \"hiking\" type stuff in Scotland.\n\nGear:\n\n\\- the backpack\n\n\\- canvas totebag, folds up into a pocket\n\n\\- reusable grocery bag, also folds up into a pocket\n\n\\- small RFID blocking pouch for passport and other things\n\n\\- 2 small amazon packing cubes\n\n\\- 1 toiletry bag (it's crazy how much fits in this lmao)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClothing:\n\n\\- 3 tank tops\n\n\\- cropped cardigan\n\n\\- black t shirt\n\n\\- graphic tee and sleep shorts for pj's\n\n\\- sports bra and soft triangle bra\n\n\\- black dress (and tights and bicycle shorts)\n\n\\- 2 pairs of leggings\n\n\\- 1 pair of heavier pants: can't decide between black mom jeans pictured, light flared jeans, flared orange corduroys, or tan-coloured Vans work pants\n\n\\- oversized flannel in orange/black colour not pictured\n\n\\- Levi's \"90's trucker\" jean jacket not pictured\n\n\\- shoes: leaning toward palladium revolt hi platform boot but also considering my platform Vans\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToiletries:\n\n\\- for hair: comb, claw clip, hair ties and pins, travel sized bottle of detangling spray\n\n\\- for skin: (some of these are small samples from dermatologist) sunscreen, travel sized Dove body wash, Aveeno body lotion, tea tree oil, tiny hand cream, Cetaphil cleanser, Cetaphil lotion, tiny perfume sample\n\n\\- makeup: Maybelline baby skin primer, eyeshadow primer, white eyeliner pencil, black eyeliner pencil, 2 eyeshadow singles, 1 duo eyeshadow brush, cheek/lip stick, mini mascara, 2 lip balms (one is coca cola and the other is normal lol), and Clinique powder blush (this one is bulkier but im taking it because it has a mirror and its own brush), and makeup wipes\n\n\\- medical: lactase pills, Tums, advil, inhaler, pads\n\n\\- other: toothbrush/toothpaste, floss, Essie nail polish, cuticle pusher, mini nail file, beaded necklace\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther things:\n\n\\- macbook air and charger (unfortunately need to take a class this summer which starts during my trip, bummer)\n\n\\- iphone and charging cord (fits into the mac charging block)\n\n\\- kindle\n\n\\- 2 earphones (both wired, one for iphone and one regular)\n\n\\- gameboy advance and charger and small case for 3 games\n\n\\- adaptor (going to buy this soon)\n\n\\- extra pair of eyeglasses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so that's pretty much everything. I have a few questions and extra things here:\n\n\\- I want to take flip flops for hostel showers. But what do i do with them once they're wet? they're just the standard ones from Old Navy lol.\n\n\\- I really can't fit a rain coat in the bag now. Do I actually need one? Is it reasonable to just wing it and thrift one there if it gets rainy?\n\n\\- I'm definitely planning on doing laundry a few times but I'm not sure if all my hostels have laundry machines. Are the laundromats in these areas expensive at all?",

            "body": "(ETA: thanks everyone for the helpful comments! i'm definitely bringing a rain jacket, i found one in my closet that has a fleece lining and layers well with my jean jacket for if it gets cold. I'm also considering ditching the flannel, tee shirt, a tank top, and one of the leggings so i can fit a light turtleneck (think tee shirt material) for layering.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhey yall, just got my Decathlon 23L NH500 backpack and i've been trying to fit everything in it for my trip. I'm going to London for a few days, Scotland for about a week, and then Belgium and Paris for a few days each. Totaling about 2.5 weeks. Still not sure what the weather will look like since it's spring and it varies. it's going to be mostly city touring with lots of walking, but with a bit more outdoorsy \"hiking\" type stuff in Scotland.\n\nGear:\n\n\\- the backpack\n\n\\- canvas totebag, folds up into a pocket\n\n\\- reusable grocery bag, also folds up into a pocket\n\n\\- small RFID blocking pouch for passport and other things\n\n\\- 2 small amazon packing cubes\n\n\\- 1 toiletry bag (it's crazy how much fits in this lmao)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClothing:\n\n\\- 3 tank tops\n\n\\- cropped cardigan\n\n\\- black t shirt\n\n\\- graphic tee and sleep shorts for pj's\n\n\\- sports bra and soft triangle bra\n\n\\- black dress (and tights and bicycle shorts)\n\n\\- 2 pairs of leggings\n\n\\- 1 pair of heavier pants: can't decide between black mom jeans pictured, light flared jeans, flared orange corduroys, or tan-coloured Vans work pants\n\n\\- oversized flannel in orange/black colour not pictured\n\n\\- Levi's \"90's trucker\" jean jacket not pictured\n\n\\- shoes: leaning toward palladium revolt hi platform boot but also considering my platform Vans\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToiletries:\n\n\\- for hair: comb, claw clip, hair ties and pins, travel sized bottle of detangling spray\n\n\\- for skin: (some of these are small samples from dermatologist) sunscreen, travel sized Dove body wash, Aveeno body lotion, tea tree oil, tiny hand cream, Cetaphil cleanser, Cetaphil lotion, tiny perfume sample\n\n\\- makeup: Maybelline baby skin primer, eyeshadow primer, white eyeliner pencil, black eyeliner pencil, 2 eyeshadow singles, 1 duo eyeshadow brush, cheek/lip stick, mini mascara, 2 lip balms (one is coca cola and the other is normal lol), and Clinique powder blush (this one is bulkier but im taking it because it has a mirror and its own brush), and makeup wipes\n\n\\- medical: lactase pills, Tums, advil, inhaler, pads\n\n\\- other: toothbrush/toothpaste, floss, Essie nail polish, cuticle pusher, mini nail file, beaded necklace\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther things:\n\n\\- macbook air and charger (unfortunately need to take a class this summer which starts during my trip, bummer)\n\n\\- iphone and charging cord (fits into the mac charging block)\n\n\\- kindle\n\n\\- 2 earphones (both wired, one for iphone and one regular)\n\n\\- gameboy advance and charger and small case for 3 games\n\n\\- adaptor (going to buy this soon)\n\n\\- extra pair of eyeglasses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay so that's pretty much everything. I have a few questions and extra things here:\n\n\\- I want to take flip flops for hostel showers. But what do i do with them once they're wet? they're just the standard ones from Old Navy lol.\n\n\\- I really can't fit a rain coat in the bag now. Do I actually need one? Is it reasonable to just wing it and thrift one there if it gets rainy?\n\n\\- I'm definitely planning on doing laundry a few times but I'm not sure if all my hostels have laundry machines. Are the laundromats in these areas expensive at all?",

            "body": "Received my Errant Pro and MK-2 LT Camera cube. Loving the bag so far! But was a little confused initially about correctly attaching the camera cube. It has velcro strips for attaching to the panel of the bag that is facing the front. The side flap on the camera cube is also opening in that direction. Which is the opposite direction of the side pocket of the bag itself. I think with MK-1 you can tuck the cube's side flap under the bag's flap, but this is not the case with MK-2. So I folded it inside the cube itself. Is this the correct way to use it? \r  \n\r  \nI chose MK-2 over MK-1 because I intend to carry one mirrorless camera and maybe an extra lens, and I want the rest of the bag to accommodate other tech items - cables, laptop charger, headphones etc... I have MK-1 on order too, so I can try both cubes and decide which one I like best. Plus it was on 30% off sale earlier today.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/dhvuox/3_nights_in_istanbul_with_the_boundary_errant/",
        "selftext": "*I'm having issues uploading the images for some reason... I reduced the size below 300kb, still \"processing\"...*\n\nHello Onebaggers,\n\nIt has now been a while since I have the Errant but I mainly used it as EDC and gym bag. I own an [Allpa 28 that I used for longer travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/couzgm/25_weeks_in_south_east_asia/) but I wanted to test the Errant for Onebag purposes. Every Errant owner realizes that it holds a \"small\" 24l (the capacity announced by Boundary Supply) but I wanted to see whether I could onebag with it anyway! 3 nights is a short trip but it was a good start to see if it is doable.\n\nThe trickiest part was to find the perfect packing cube for the bag, I have tried the pack it specter from eagle creek, the amazon basics and the gonex compression cubes. But in the end, the best packing cube for the Boundary Errant is the Peak Design small compression cube.\n\n[The cube is a perfect fit: image](https://imgur.com/r3uQ21B)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img i59d270ocks31...*\n\nThis cube surprisingly holds a considerable amount of clothes but if you need more (for a longer period), I find that the Gonex compression cube \"slim\" fits very well at the place where I put my Montbell umbrella. For this trip, I did not need to use the shoe compartment so the packing cube rested at the bottom of the bag, but if you use the compartment, the cube will be a bit higher, which is not an issue at all.\n\n**Complete packing list:**\n\n* On me:\n   * Jeans\n   * Icebreaker merino t-shirt\n   * Sports jacket\n   * Belt\n   * Merino socks\n   * Boxer briefs\n   * Wallet\n   * Phone\n   * Onitsuka tiger comfortable sneakers\n* In the [Peak design small cube](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/packing-cube?variant=11531140038700):\n   * 1 airism uniqlo t-shirt\n   * 1 uniqlo dry t-shirt\n   * 1 uniqlo heattech long-sleeve t-shirt\n   * 1 DC hybrid shorts\n   * 1 uniqlo hoodie\n   * 3 pairs of boxer briefs\n   * 1 pair of merino socks\n* In the inside lateral mesh pockets:\n   * In right one, transparent dopp kit with:\n      * Electric toothbrush\n      * Electric razor\n      * Toothpaste\n      * Deodorant\n   * In the left one:\n      * Montbell umbrella\n      * Vapur bottle when empty\n* In the inside top pocket:\n   * Taotronics ANC headphones\n   * Jack cable\n   * Plane jack adaptor\n* In the front pocket:\n   * Sunglasses\n* In the lateral quick access pocket:\n   * Keys attached to a carabiner (itself attached to a loop)\n   * Lumix TZ100\n   * Pen\n* In the secret passport pocket:\n   * I'll let you guess\n* In the shoe compartment:\n   * Nothing\n* On the laptop side:\n   * Asus 14 inches laptop\n   * Charger\n   * Kindle\n   * Powerbank\n   * USB cable\n   * Power plug\n   * Backup earphones\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The laptop side](https://imgur.com/m5ZXZc0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The bigger picture](https://imgur.com/ea4ZJuc)\n\nI could have easily added stuff in the shoe compartment (my size 44 are a tight squeeze but fit if needs be) such as flip flops or a jacket. I also had a lot of space on the top of the bag by accessing it from the front (top) opening. I did place my sports jacket (quite bulky) there on some occasions and still had leftover space. I was also easily able fit my filled bottle in the bottle holder on the outside of the bag, even when fully packed.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that the bag is actually usable to onebag for longer trips and it has the advantage to be an excellent EDC once you arrive at destination. I could have easily added some soap or laundry product had I wanted to travel for longer. The blazer and hoodie overlap in terms of layer usage but I was not limited by space at all. In terms of weight, with the laptop I reach around 6kg and it is true that the bag is heavy by itself. But the benefits are a great back panel extremely breathable, as well as good protection for the laptop and pockets that provide for an easy organization.\n\nThe moment where the Errant shines the most is actually in the plane: it is super easy to place it under the seat and extremely convenient to access the different compartments. During the return flight, I had one of those window seats with a metallic box below the seat in front of me but I could still easily fit my bag next to it.\n\nBonus: I met a Prima system owner at Istanbul airport who was boarding the same plane. As proper backpack geeks, we obviously took the chance to discuss and compare our bags.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[His prima on the left \\(only half full since he also had a checked in luggage\\) and my errant on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/bl599sl88ks31.jpg?width=1040&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=777fc24a22e027b6b89bea80e3dd337af6a4ee22)\n\nDo you have questions on the Errant or the Allpa? Feel free to ask ! I'm also super interested to hear your tips and tricks when travelling below the 25l capacity, I'm still very new to this community but it is extremely motivating and rewarding!",

                "body": "If you check my [previous Allpa packing list](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/couzgm/25_weeks_in_south_east_asia/), you will see that I managed to put (much) more stuff in the bag than in the errant. I would actually say that the Allpa is a small 28L and the Errant is a small 24L. They both offer a lot of inside organization, which I like, but it occupies much more space than a big boxy compartment.\n\nSeeing your list, what concerns me most is your electronics and the photo gear which is tough to find place for, even in the Allpa. If, for example, you were planning to use the camera cube by Boundary supply, you won't have enough space to put anything else in the bag.\n\nA big difference between both bags is the laptop compartment. In the Allpa, it competes with the rest of the bag. this means that if the bag is fully packed, you won't be able to squeeze a laptop in afterwards. The Errant's laptop compartment occupies a definite space making it easy to place the laptop but also guaranteeing that you lose main compartment space, and this even if the laptop compartment is empty.\n\nWith my post, I wanted to see if the Errant is usable for minimal travel. It is, but it has to be very minimal! The Allpa allows for more luxury items (although you **have** to take a day bag with you). If it is the style of the Errant that attracts you, perhaps you could check out the Prima System?\n\nIf you have more questions, feel free!\n\nGoodluck!",

Urban Assault 24 to MAYBE replace my Errant for work and also the Full Moon for my out and about days. \n\nBeen using the Errant for about three weeks now and actually REALLY enjoy it and everyday liking it more and more. The comfort is great, like the organization, but the magnetic opening is just a bit too finicky although it is cool! So not being 100% satisfied I decided to try a different pack, something more familiar. \n\nI chose the Mystery Ranch to try as I’ve had a history with Mystery Ranch with my first pack being the MiUSA 3 Day Assault issued to me in the military about 5 years ago and loved it, so the UA24 seemed perfect! I was actually EXTREMELY SURPRISED as to how easy the UA24 was to pack and how it fit everything in my Errant. I actually prefer the organization of the UA24 and am a HUGE FAN of the Y-Zip. I’m super excited to test it out tomorrow and I have very high hopes and have a feeling the Errant will be tossed to the side.",

At first glance it feels awesome, little smaller (which I like) but much better quality than i expected. Gonna use it as a large man purse for my wallet, keys, ipads, glasses, and sometimes laptop. Shoutout to the PD everyday bag in the back!",

I knew about BS’s questionable quality going in but said screw it, especially  loving x-pac since I’ve had aer bags but i know others hate it. After thoroughly researching an edc for the price that was also over engineered and stealth black that had similar features I settled on this, accepting the tradeoffs. I’ll update you in 3 years about the quality 🙌🏽",

            "body": "It was waiting for me when I got home - a good way to end the week.\n\nThe rundown:\n\n* I have only had it in my hands for 30 minutes so I can't say I love it (yet) but I *really* like it.\n* Dimensions are a bit larger then the MW Spar but it can hold significantly more due to its greater (and expandable) depth.\n* The X-pac material is not quite as stiff as some others I've felt and it's also less crinkly/crackly sounding. The feel is smooth and substantial.\n* The front organizational pocket can be accessed from either side. Hooray for ambidextrous bags!) It's got a triangular organizational layout: each side of the triangle has one slash pocket with 3 elasticized loops sewn to the front and there's a magnetic mount for Boundary's magnetic keyring at the point of the triangle. Look at the pics as it's sort of hard to explain.\n* The top stash pocket is deeper than I expected - big enough for any phone, a glasses case, and some small miscellaneous items like AirPods for sure.\n* The externally accessed 13\" laptop pocket is not suspended but is well padded, especially on the bottom. It has a cord pass-through to the stash pocket and some more webbing loops, too.\n* Main pocket is just that - one big pocket with no other organization.\n* There are magnets at the top of the flap opening of the main pocket that hold the opening pleat closed. It's a nice touch to keep things tidy and helps to prevent the fabric from bowing out sideways when you close it .\n* There are also magnets at the bottom that hold a fold in place if that bag isn't filled to keep the nice, thin profile.\n* The strap is great. Overbuilt with plenty of padding for anything you'll be carrying in a bag this small. It's also long enough to fit me (6' 2\" 175lbs) while still having plenty of adjustment left.\n* It is also very easy to swing the bag around to the front for easy access to the front and stash pockets.\n* The Arclite rides fine at mid-back and low-slung heights and I've cinched it up so it rides high the way I like to wear messenger bags to sit as well. It's solid and slotted in all positions although I obviously haven't put it to any kind of real test yet.\n* I have the same Fidlock buckles on 2 other bags and they are excellent.\n\nI think it's perfectly sized: larger than a typical sling but smaller than a typical backpack or shoulder bag. Or maybe I should say it's perfectly sized for what I'll be using it for, which is carrying a laptop. charger, tablet, wallet, keys, small water bottle to work and several water bottles, my wallet, and shades when I go to the park with my kids and a book, tablet, misc crap when I'm just out and about.\n\n**Edited to add:**  I got their Transit case as well and that's the pouch you see mounted on the strap.\n\n**Edited again to add:**   I slid my fingers into the various lash points to identify them in the pics.\n\n**Edited a 3rd time to add**:  I have given my fair share of grief to Boundary in regards to their poor communication, chaotic logistics, and pay-before-we-submit-the-order business model.  And I think those criticisms are deserved.  However, I've owned an Errant and now this Arclite and I think they make well built, innovative gear. I truly hope they address their challenges, continue to build on their strengths, and keep making cool bags.  We need more ideas and innovation for our chosen addiction, not less.",

I hope to place my Sony A6700 mirrorless camera (give or take approximately 4.8 x 2.72 x 2.52 in) with a pancake lens into one of the two quick-access pockets.  I remember in one of Evergoods videos they said it could fit the CAP 1L ([official ](https://youtu.be/5tLekMVmqtM?si=rTo4tW5s867i6U2Y&amp;t=55)video at about 58 sec) but was unable to see if anyone actually fit one into the QA pockets. In the video, he even takes out a bottle of water that would be about the width of the camera but not sure about the depth. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! ",

Same kit also fits in the yoke pocket, but it is tighter there, could maybe squeeze an M+35 Summicron. \n\nI'd say the benefit of the yoke pocket is that it's high and out of the way and the harness system offers some incidental padding. The front dump pocket is roomier (could fit an M + 35mm Summicron or 'Lux easily) but with less padding and more prone to taking hits because of where it is situated on the bag.\n\nGreat idea,  thanks!",

If you’re going to put your camera in the exterior quick access pocket, I might say that you’d want to consider not planning on packing out that top interior panel pocket, if that makes sense.",

                "body": "Yeah they designed they bag more like an unibody enclosure. Every pocked on this bag shares the same internal space. You either put your water bag on the outside or on the inside, you can't do both. You stuff the side pocket with stuff, you can't use the mesh in the inside. You use the bottom compartment and you're out of luck using an MK2 insert. Just having a damn mouse and charger on the mesh pocked of the laptop insert makes adding things difficult in the main compartment. They could at least make the bottom compartment extend outwards, not inwards.\n\nTo me this feels like a bag that someone at Errant wanted and not something that customers needed. So he made a kickstarter to make his dream bag and then thought it would be great for everyone else too. They clearly did not test this bag with a wide enough audience and even if they had feedback, they didn't actually listen to any. The fucking laptop magnet fidlocks are still there even though everyone asked for them to be removed!",

I tried packing the main compartment pockets with accessories (chargers, notepads) and it literally left me zero room for any of my other items. A strange set up for a bag that I had high hopes for.
