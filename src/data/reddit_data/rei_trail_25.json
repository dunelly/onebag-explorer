They need to be able to build the pack (sew it together) and then insert the metal frame afterward and a zipper is a really easy solution.  It's not intended to be opened up by the user so that's why it doesn't have a tab on the zipper.   Its a pretty clever and simple trick for assembly when you think about it",

            "body": "# TL;DR\n\nTravelling with an under seat bag was so freeing. I breezed through airport security,and every train station I needed to take to get to my hotel. However, I learned that I could have lived with even less. \n\nMy tablet and eReader were used for two hours total. I should have packed an additional pair of jeans instead of 3 pairs of tech pants. The pants were a bit thin, and I didn't like the way they looked with my cotton tops. I think I'll also opt for a different set of layers when I travel in the winter. The puffer jacket was fine during the day, but at night things got a bit cold, and I also just don't like the feeling of nylon jackets that much. \n\nI am motivated to continue traveling with just an underseat bag wherever I go in the future.\n\n# Packing List\n\n## Context / Summary\n\n25M. 5' 7\" built like a twig and get cold very easily. Chronic overpacker who struggles to contain the two wolves inside me.  The one who says \"I should only bring one bag and pack the lightest and warmest clothes,\" versus the other who says  \"You need to look good in every candid photo someone might take of you.\" Spent most of the time in Tokyo but ventured out to Mt. Fuji one day. It was only really cold when we went up to Fuji's 5th station, but I was out of the car for maybe a total of 30 minutes. Otherwise it was ~ 50 degrees Farenheit during the day and ~ 30 degrees Fahrenheit at night with very little wind. \n\n## Bags \n\nPreviously I used a Eagle Creek Tour 40L for 10 days in Europe and was able to put it in the overhead bin for all my domestic and international flights since my tickets guarunteed me that space. However, since I was flying barebones economy fares for some of my flights to Japan, I decided to make a trip to REI for something that could fit under the seat. \n\n### REI Trail 25\n\n- Fits under the aisle seats in United Economy when its packed full. Needs to be put overhead if you're sitting in Premium Plus. Flight attendants didn't bother me about it when it was under the seat. On my return flight in the US, the gate agents were checking carry on bags but waved me through even though I was carrying both this bag and the flash 18. \n\n### REI Flash 18\n\n- You gotta take the foam back panel out to get it folded up, but it packed nicely at the bottom of the Trail 25.\n- **The drawstring got caught in the airport security roller so make sure it is inside the bin if you send it through security**\n\n## Worn\n- Packable Puffer Jacket \n- Cotton Button Down\n- Black T Shirt as undershirt\n- Stretchy Jeans\n- Smartwatch\n- Compression Socks\n- Undies\n- Sneakers\n\n## Packed\n\n### Clothes\n\nPut all my clothes in packing cubes. Makes rummaging around the bag way easier. \n\n- 5 pairs of undies\n- Pair of gloves\n- Pair of long johns\n- 5 pairs of cotton socks\n- 3 t shirts\n- Long sleeve polo\n- Crewneck sweater\n- Turtleneck sweater\n- Tanktop to sleep in\n- 3 pairs of tech pants\n\n### Minimal Toiletries\nPrescription medications (pills + topicals), hair gel, toothpaste, battery powered electric toothbrush, deoderant. \n\n### Misc\n- REI Flash 18 in bottom of Trail 25\n- Tablet\n- eReader\n- Small clip light for eReader\n- Sleeping mask\n- Sandwich bag with all chargers + plane adapter for noise cancelling headphones\n- 3 yard wrap to use as blanket / scarf\n- Money belt / fanny pack I was given on a Rick Steves tour\n- Noise cancelling headphones\n\n# What Worked\n- **3 yard wrap.**  I did not need to use it on the plane since I was given a blanket on both international flights (see disclaimer) However, as a scarf it was perfect and doubled as a hood when my ears got cold. \n\t- disclaimer: a friend had to burn united points and upgraded me to premium plus for my international flights. no lie flat seat, but they did give me a blanket and pillow. **i would definitely find something to pack as a blanket if you have trouble sleeping on long flights.**\n- Gloves.\n- Extra bag for souveniers. \n- Sweaters were great layers especially the turtleneck. \n\n# What I Wish I Did Differently\n\n## Should Not Have Packed\n- Tablet and eReader\n  - I only used the tablet to play balatro, and the rest of the time I just watched whatever movies they had on the plane\n- Long johns. Didn't even wear them. \n- Long sleeve polo too thin for winter unfortunately. \n\n## Wish I Brought\n\n- Beanie or balaclava\n\n## Gear I Should Swap Out Going Forward\n### Winter Jacket.\nEven with layers, the [Amazon Essentials brand](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Lightweight-Water-Resistant-Packable/dp/B08SS86FTH/ref=pd_day0fbt_softlines_d_sccl_1/145-8042475-0087026?pd_rd_w=Uzdqx&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.e623a499-3f42-4d5d-a0f7-88c53e0a68d7&amp;pf_rd_p=e623a499-3f42-4d5d-a0f7-88c53e0a68d7&amp;pf_rd_r=WBWV99N1JMT47BMP3WVC&amp;pd_rd_wg=fedLn&amp;pd_rd_r=cb52a169-ab38-4a93-bdd2-9c5a508f9d76&amp;pd_rd_i=B08SS86FTH&amp;psc=1) puffer wasn't that warm when the sun went down.  However, I don't think I would like another puffer jacket even if it was the nicest and warmest down since I'm just not a fan of Nylon material. In the future I'll go with a sweater, soft shell and a windbreaker / rain jacket layer on top. If you have any winter coat / layering suggestions please leave them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1harorl/hate_the_feeling_of_puffer_lightweight_winter/).\n\n### Pants\n\nI only wore 2/3 tech pants, and eneded up wearing the jeans most of the time. Even though I walked 5+ miles most days, I didn't stink up the pants.  I could have gotten away with another pair of jeans or work pants. Nylon doesn't look that good with the tops I brought, and the wind definitely cut through them since they are more for spring and summer.",

            "body": "# TL;DR\n\nTravelling with an under seat bag was so freeing. I breezed through airport security,and every train station I needed to take to get to my hotel. However, I learned that I could have lived with even less. \n\nMy tablet and eReader were used for two hours total. I should have packed an additional pair of jeans instead of 3 pairs of tech pants. The pants were a bit thin, and I didn't like the way they looked with my cotton tops. I think I'll also opt for a different set of layers when I travel in the winter. The puffer jacket was fine during the day, but at night things got a bit cold, and I also just don't like the feeling of nylon jackets that much. \n\nI am motivated to continue traveling with just an underseat bag wherever I go in the future.\n\n# Packing List\n\n## Context / Summary\n\n25M. 5' 7\" built like a twig and get cold very easily. Chronic overpacker who struggles to contain the two wolves inside me.  The one who says \"I should only bring one bag and pack the lightest and warmest clothes,\" versus the other who says  \"You need to look good in every candid photo someone might take of you.\" Spent most of the time in Tokyo but ventured out to Mt. Fuji one day. It was only really cold when we went up to Fuji's 5th station, but I was out of the car for maybe a total of 30 minutes. Otherwise it was ~ 50 degrees Farenheit during the day and ~ 30 degrees Fahrenheit at night with very little wind. \n\n## Bags \n\nPreviously I used a Eagle Creek Tour 40L for 10 days in Europe and was able to put it in the overhead bin for all my domestic and international flights since my tickets guarunteed me that space. However, since I was flying barebones economy fares for some of my flights to Japan, I decided to make a trip to REI for something that could fit under the seat. \n\n### REI Trail 25\n\n- Fits under the aisle seats in United Economy when its packed full. Needs to be put overhead if you're sitting in Premium Plus. Flight attendants didn't bother me about it when it was under the seat. On my return flight in the US, the gate agents were checking carry on bags but waved me through even though I was carrying both this bag and the flash 18. \n\n### REI Flash 18\n\n- You gotta take the foam back panel out to get it folded up, but it packed nicely at the bottom of the Trail 25.\n- **The drawstring got caught in the airport security roller so make sure it is inside the bin if you send it through security**\n\n## Worn\n- Packable Puffer Jacket \n- Cotton Button Down\n- Black T Shirt as undershirt\n- Stretchy Jeans\n- Smartwatch\n- Compression Socks\n- Undies\n- Sneakers\n\n## Packed\n\n### Clothes\n\nPut all my clothes in packing cubes. Makes rummaging around the bag way easier. \n\n- 5 pairs of undies\n- Pair of gloves\n- Pair of long johns\n- 5 pairs of cotton socks\n- 3 t shirts\n- Long sleeve polo\n- Crewneck sweater\n- Turtleneck sweater\n- Tanktop to sleep in\n- 3 pairs of tech pants\n\n### Minimal Toiletries\nPrescription medications (pills + topicals), hair gel, toothpaste, battery powered electric toothbrush, deoderant. \n\n### Misc\n- REI Flash 18 in bottom of Trail 25\n- Tablet\n- eReader\n- Small clip light for eReader\n- Sleeping mask\n- Sandwich bag with all chargers + plane adapter for noise cancelling headphones\n- 3 yard wrap to use as blanket / scarf\n- Money belt / fanny pack I was given on a Rick Steves tour\n- Noise cancelling headphones\n\n# What Worked\n- **3 yard wrap.**  I did not need to use it on the plane since I was given a blanket on both international flights (see disclaimer) However, as a scarf it was perfect and doubled as a hood when my ears got cold. \n\t- disclaimer: a friend had to burn united points and upgraded me to premium plus for my international flights. no lie flat seat, but they did give me a blanket and pillow. **i would definitely find something to pack as a blanket if you have trouble sleeping on long flights.**\n- Gloves.\n- Extra bag for souveniers. \n- Sweaters were great layers especially the turtleneck. \n\n# What I Wish I Did Differently\n\n## Should Not Have Packed\n- Tablet and eReader\n  - I only used the tablet to play balatro, and the rest of the time I just watched whatever movies they had on the plane\n- Long johns. Didn't even wear them. \n- Long sleeve polo too thin for winter unfortunately. \n\n## Wish I Brought\n\n- Beanie or balaclava\n\n## Gear I Should Swap Out Going Forward\n### Winter Jacket.\nEven with layers, the [Amazon Essentials brand](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Essentials-Lightweight-Water-Resistant-Packable/dp/B08SS86FTH/ref=pd_day0fbt_softlines_d_sccl_1/145-8042475-0087026?pd_rd_w=Uzdqx&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.e623a499-3f42-4d5d-a0f7-88c53e0a68d7&amp;pf_rd_p=e623a499-3f42-4d5d-a0f7-88c53e0a68d7&amp;pf_rd_r=WBWV99N1JMT47BMP3WVC&amp;pd_rd_wg=fedLn&amp;pd_rd_r=cb52a169-ab38-4a93-bdd2-9c5a508f9d76&amp;pd_rd_i=B08SS86FTH&amp;psc=1) puffer wasn't that warm when the sun went down.  However, I don't think I would like another puffer jacket even if it was the nicest and warmest down since I'm just not a fan of Nylon material. In the future I'll go with a sweater, soft shell and a windbreaker / rain jacket layer on top. If you have any winter coat / layering suggestions please leave them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1harorl/hate_the_feeling_of_puffer_lightweight_winter/).\n\n### Pants\n\nI only wore 2/3 tech pants, and eneded up wearing the jeans most of the time. Even though I walked 5+ miles most days, I didn't stink up the pants.  I could have gotten away with another pair of jeans or work pants. Nylon doesn't look that good with the tops I brought, and the wind definitely cut through them since they are more for spring and summer.",

I need to choose it without being there as I’m meeting my friend at a conference and she will bring one for me to bring home. I’ve tried the REI Trail 25 on in-store and found it incredibly comfortable. I’m worried it’s a bit delicate and not waterproof enough for living in the rainy Northwest of Lancaster/Cumbria. The Gregory Resin looks a little “smarter” for going to conferences and is more likely to help me out in rain. Because I’ve one-bagged with as much as 20 lbs that needs to be taken into account as well (also need to just carry less). \n\nCrucial to me is the sternum strap, some back/shoulder paddding on straps etc, a water bottle pocket, and a large main compartment to take packing cubes/bags. My usual bag is a black Osprey Porter 30 but it’s too “cinched down” for every day use and no water bottle pocket. It also looks too big on some of the airlines I’ve brought it as my personal bag.",

That’s the point where I would shift to a pack that has a true load transferring harness and comes in a torso size that fits properly.

Never check the water-resistance, mainly because I never use it for anything that’s critical for staying dry. I’d say just use a plastic liner if you’re worried about it. \n\nEither way, great bag. Wouldn’t say it’s worth the full asking price, I’d wait until REI runs one of its many sales to grab one. \n\nFor that matter I think the Resin may still be on sale in the outlet section of the REI website",

I tried the 26 as well and it was a bit too big (stuck out from my back too far). I like using the Resin 24 since I can pull out my packing cubes and use it as a daypack when I reach my destination. Main compartment is huge and just a giant bucket so you can fit a lot in there! The exterior is very durable and water resistant (haven't tried it in a downpour, but it's fine for drizzles I'd imagine). Fits under the seat of any airline I've tried.\n\nIt's very comfortable for regular usage and walking around (10 mile days, including many miles fully packed on the way to/from the airport). Wasn't as comfortable to use when biking, but I didn't get it for that purpose. The back panel has ventilation so my back stayed dry. It fits under the seat on airlines and the way it zips up with the gussets helps compress your stuff even more. I've taken it to Alaska, Michigan, and Minneapolis so far. Haven't tried the Trail 25, but the Resin 24 checked all of my marks!\n\nOne note is that I don't usually bring a laptop, so I wanted a bag with minimal laptop space but that still had a compartment just in case. With a laptop it would get a bit more snug inside but the laptop would be right next to your back which is nice for weight distribution. Good luck!",

Loop it through the daisy chains and across the front and you have an instant front shove it pocket! Shoes, rain gear, whatever you want to put in there. Super cheap, adds a safety cuz it’s reflective, and there’s dozens of colors on Amazon\n\nEdit: For everyone asking about shock-cord or paracord. This is actually shock-cord. I misspoke in my original post. It is stretchy. \n\nAlso for those demanding cat tax here you go! \n  [cat tax ] (https://imgur.com/gallery/oTpXbgi)",

Quick thoughts:\n\n\\- Initial impression is the bag feels on the smaller side of 25L.  It's light but the overall construction seems perfectly adequate for its intended purpose.  \n\n\\- The clamshell opening is nice and the zipper pulls operate smoothly.  There is a nice zippered mesh pocket with a key clip in the main compartment flap that ends where the front flap pocket starts.\n\n\\- I didn't like the compression straps that get in the way of main compartment zipper.  But they do act like a stop if accessing from the top, and the way the zipper bends around at the top makes the opening wider (thus access easier) than a straight zipper.\n\n\\- One other thing I didn't like, and not readily apparent from the pictures or the description on the product page, is the front pocket flap is held down with two velcro patches.  Nothing else secures the pocket but the velcro.  The pocket does have depth so a good amount can fit.",

        "selftext": "I'm working on getting a onebag kit arranged around sub 1kg, sub 30 liter packs. This comparison features the 28 liter Osprey Apogee and the REI Trail 25 backpacks. \n\nPack comparison images\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/65g9K5t.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/I5TDYdc.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/h2BRffu.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BSYMAW8.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vSeCPN1.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Xe2AteN.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jeA26In.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Yd9XELh.jpg\n\n\nThe Apogee is rated at 28 liters and the factory published measurements are 19.7H X 11.43W X 9.46D IN., 1.81 LBS. (50H X 29W X 24D CM, 0.82 KG). My measurements with the pack reasonable full were 20.5\" tall, 10\" deep and 11\" wide. It was 28 ounces on my scale. \n\n\nThe REI Trail 25 is rated at 25 liters, 19.5 x 13.25 x 7.5 inches and 2lbs. I measured the pack at 10\" deep when packed reasonable full,  11\" wide and 18.5\" tall. It was 32 ounces on my scale.  \n\n\nThe Apogee has two layers, with a large half-clamshell zipper on the main compartment and another outer compartment with a row of several small pockets neat the top sized for smart phone, power bank, glasses, etc and continues all the way to the bottom. There is another pocket at the top with a dimpled interior that is designed to be scratch free. The main compartment has a thinly padded laptop sleeve that ends just a bit off the bottom and there is a simple fabric sleeve on the side of the laptop compartment.  Most of the interior is dark blue. The outer side water bottle pockets are very sleek stretch mesh that open towards the user's back and prevent a bottle from falling out when the use bends over. There are two compression straps near the top that have pockets to tuck them into when not needed. A 6\" padded tubular webbing handle runs across the top. The removable waist belt is 3/4\" webbing. The shoulder straps are padded 3D mesh with a sliding sternum strap\n\nMy general packing strategy is to use a small Osprey garment folder and whatever size and quantity compression and standard packing cubes are needed and will fit. In the case of the Apogee, my inclination is to put the folder in the front compartment with medium compression cubes stacked horizontally in the main compartment and tubular cubes on the sides and my toiletries bag on top. \n\nThe Trail 25 is a little boxier and has some trail oriented hardware for trekking poles and tools, and a double daisy chain down the front. There is a zippered pocket at the top and two stretch mesh pocket on the left side and one more on the right. A rain cover is stored in a zippered pocket near the bottom. There are two compression straps on the bottom and two more near the top. Inside the main compartment is a fabric hydration/laptop sleeve with a bladder hanger and a hose exit port on the right. There is a tall mesh pocket inside on the right. There is a zippered mesh pocket on the lid on the same plane with the outer top pocket. The zipper on the main compartment is a half clamshell, giving good access with the contents. The lining is a very light gray giving good visibility. The removable waist belt is 1\" webbing. The shoulder straps hand an S curve with a sliding sternum strap. A webbing handle/hang loop is at the top.  \n\nWith one big compartment my packing strategy would be to put the folder up against the back panel, two medium compression cubes stack horizontally in front of the folder with tubular cubes on the side. My rain jacket, wind shell and fleece would be folded and stowed next to the lid. \n\nThe packs are both viable travel packs. The Osprey is sleeker looking and 5 ounces lighter. The REI has some trail oriented features and has a boxier look. \n\nBoth can be carried on as overhead luggage and are still small enough to be used as day bags. With shrinking luggage size and weight limits I think bags of this type are the future of onebag travel. \n\n\nI do supplement sub 30 liter onebag packs like these with a 12 liter messenger bag as a \"personal bag\" with all my tech items, TSA liquids bag, personal medications and any \"show stopper\" items should my main bag need to be gate checked. I do prefer a crossbody bag over a backpack as a day bag for crowded urban settings. It gives a 40% boost in volume and better organization as well. \n\nI should mention that I travel for leisure only and favor casual dress.",

                "body": "The now discontinued Patagonia Mini Messenger. It adds 12 liters capacity, lots of organization and a small external water bottle pocket. That's enough room for a phone, power bank, cables, earbuds, camera, small journal, pens, sunglasses, snacks, gloves, beanie cap, and a light rain jacket or other layer. \n\nPatagonia has made some other similar bags like the Half Mass. They generally lack noisy Velcro closures and have a water bottle pocket on one end, top grab handle and open top sleeve on the back-- all things I want in a bag. \n\nMessenger/crossbody bags shouldn't be too large and limited to a few pounds for all day carry. Those bags that don't have organization can be helped along with a couple zippered pouches. Soft and flexible is good for a better body hugging carry. \n\nOther candidates:\n\n- Manhattan Portage medium DJ bag\n- Cotopaxi Taal crossbody/backpack convertible\n- LL Bean Flowfold medium crossbody (x-pac!)\n- Tom Bihn medium Cafe bag, Maker's Bag, and Daylight Briefcase\n\nBags like these are easily worn with a backpack and leave items at your fingertips. You don't need to take your pack off, extract the needed item and put your pack back on. They are great for flight bags and easily fit under the seat or just behind your legs for other than takeoff and landings. The best for \"under the radar\" camera bags. \n\nI find a crossbody much more secure and manageable in crowded urban settings. When using a small backpack, I was carrying it on one strap and under my arm for better security and it was always in the way on a crowded bus or subway. Getting in and out of taxis too. With a crossbody you simply rotate it to where it suits your needs.  \n\nThere is a weight/feature/volume dance. As with backpacks, basic size, more pockets, zippers, linings all add more weight and cost.\n\nIMHO, the practical limit is about 15 liters. Anything larger than that is clumsy and too heavy if filled. It's backpack time from there out.",

You can even tuck the compression straps into their own pockets to make them disappear and out of the way of the zippers. \n\nIt is amazing what you can get in the Trail 25. The space is efficient and it seems large for 25 liters. I did a similar comparison with a Cabin Zero 32 ADV and they are so close to the same size. \n\nBoth bags are a very good buy. The Trail 25 is $80 and I’ve seen it on sale for much less. The Apogee was $45 on sale. There are packing cubes that cost that much!",
