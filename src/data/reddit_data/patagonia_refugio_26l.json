There was quite a lot of interest in the kickstand feature of the Osprey Parsec, so I decided to post more pics of the bag showing off this feature (with some other bonus pics).\n\nThis pack has a rigid frame that wraps around the edges and bottom of the bottom so that, when stood upright, the pack stands by itself and doesn't need to be propped up. In my pictures, for instance, there is nothing in the pack and nothing propping the bag up.\n\nThe kickstand also adds a solid frame for carrying, making it a good bag for heavier loads, hiking, long treks, etc. There's also a floating mesh panel I tried to capture that separates the pack from your back allowing for good airflow. If you have a LOADED pack or some bulky items, the pack might touch your back through the mesh, although I've never had an issue with this personally.\n\nOsprey has two other bags that I know of that utilize this feature: the Tropos 34, which is the same pack but larger, and the Radial 26+8 which was meant more for bike commuting.\n\nThe biggest drawback with the kickstanding for onebagging is that the frame is rigid - no compressing the bag down, so the dimensions of the bag are set. This is to say, the pack is great for putting in overhead bins, but wouldn't fit well under the seat of a plane.\n\nI'm personally a huge fan. Feel free to ask any questions, or be in awe of the magical free-standing pack!",

There was quite a lot of interest in the kickstand feature of the Osprey Parsec, so I decided to post more pics of the bag showing off this feature (with some other bonus pics).\n\nThis pack has a rigid frame that wraps around the edges and bottom of the bottom so that, when stood upright, the pack stands by itself and doesn't need to be propped up. In my pictures, for instance, there is nothing in the pack and nothing propping the bag up.\n\nThe kickstand also adds a solid frame for carrying, making it a good bag for heavier loads, hiking, long treks, etc. There's also a floating mesh panel I tried to capture that separates the pack from your back allowing for good airflow. If you have a LOADED pack or some bulky items, the pack might touch your back through the mesh, although I've never had an issue with this personally.\n\nOsprey has two other bags that I know of that utilize this feature: the Tropos 34, which is the same pack but larger, and the Radial 26+8 which was meant more for bike commuting.\n\nThe biggest drawback with the kickstanding for onebagging is that the frame is rigid - no compressing the bag down, so the dimensions of the bag are set. This is to say, the pack is great for putting in overhead bins, but wouldn't fit well under the seat of a plane.\n\nI'm personally a huge fan.

There was quite a lot of interest in the kickstand feature of the Osprey Parsec, so I decided to post more pics of the bag showing off this feature (with some other bonus pics).\n\nThis pack has a rigid frame that wraps around the edges and bottom of the bottom so that, when stood upright, the pack stands by itself and doesn't need to be propped up. In my pictures, for instance, there is nothing in the pack and nothing propping the bag up.\n\nThe kickstand also adds a solid frame for carrying, making it a good bag for heavier loads, hiking, long treks, etc. There's also a floating mesh panel I tried to capture that separates the pack from your back allowing for good airflow. If you have a LOADED pack or some bulky items, the pack might touch your back through the mesh, although I've never had an issue with this personally.\n\nOsprey has two other bags that I know of that utilize this feature: the Tropos 34, which is the same pack but larger, and the Radial 26+8 which was meant more for bike commuting.\n\nThe biggest drawback with the kickstanding for onebagging is that the frame is rigid - no compressing the bag down, so the dimensions of the bag are set. This is to say, the pack is great for putting in overhead bins, but wouldn't fit well under the seat of a plane.\n\nI'm personally a huge fan. Feel free to ask any questions, or be in awe of the magical free-standing pack!",

            "body": "Hi again! There was quite a lot of interest in the kickstand feature of the Osprey Parsec, so I decided to post more pics of the bag showing off this feature (with some other bonus pics).\n\nThis pack has a rigid frame that wraps around the edges and bottom of the bottom so that, when stood upright, the pack stands by itself and doesn't need to be propped up. In my pictures, for instance, there is nothing in the pack and nothing propping the bag up.\n\nThe kickstand also adds a solid frame for carrying, making it a good bag for heavier loads, hiking, long treks, etc. There's also a floating mesh panel I tried to capture that separates the pack from your back allowing for good airflow. If you have a LOADED pack or some bulky items, the pack might touch your back through the mesh, although I've never had an issue with this personally.\n\nOsprey has two other bags that I know of that utilize this feature: the Tropos 34, which is the same pack but larger, and the Radial 26+8 which was meant more for bike commuting.\n\nThe biggest drawback with the kickstanding for onebagging is that the frame is rigid - no compressing the bag down, so the dimensions of the bag are set. This is to say, the pack is great for putting in overhead bins, but wouldn't fit well under the seat of a plane.\n\nI'm personally a huge fan. Feel free to ask any questions, or be in awe of the magical free-standing pack!",

            "body": "I am not entirely sure why my context comment appears to be deleted, but here it is:\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster. After benefiting immensely from the wealth of knowledge shared here, I wanted to give back to the community by sharing my recent experience traveling with only one bag to Japan and Taiwan for 20 days. My itinerary was Copenhagen &gt; Japan (Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, Osaka) &gt; Taiwan (Taipei) &gt; Japan (Tokyo) &gt; Copenhagen.\n\nThis trip marked a somewhat natural evolution in my travel style. I cannot remember what led me to travel more lightweight, but it started with a 20L suitcase from Muji which I've enjoyed, and I found it freeing to only travel with carry on luggage. In August, I went to Warsaw for five days, and since I was traveling with Wizz Air, I needed to travel even more lightly. So I went with a Fjällräven Kånken which worked surprisingly well. This was my first longer trip with only a single bag, and also the first trip where I had to rely on doing laundry to make it work, however.\n\nI had initially planned to use my Arc'teryx Granville 16 that I bought in July, but I needed to opt for a different bag due to its unbelievably abrasive backpanel that has destroyed one of my shirt jackets and was slowly destroying the back of my jacket too. Sacrificing the waterproofness and look of the Granville 16, I landed on a Refugio 26 from Patagonia instead which I found to fare well. Additionally, I also brought a sling from Uniqlo for daily use which was convenient, although I could have skipped it if I wanted to be a purist.\n\nThe base weight was roughly six kilos, and I am generally happy with how it went. You can see my packing list [here](https://lighterpack.com/r/zxxxpm).\n\nReflecting on the journey, a few insights might prove useful to others:\n\n**Tech**\n\n* MacBook Pro 14\"\n   * If I had asked for feedback on my packing list before I went, I imagine this item would likely be the one that would receive the most comments. I prefer having a laptop in comparison to only using my phone, and I do not own a tablet, so while it is definitely the heaviest item on my packing list, I don't regret it. However, I do miss the days where I could just use my MacBook 12\", so I am tempted to see how expensive it would be to fix it.\n* Anker Prime 67W GaN charger\n   * Amazing compact charger. Unfortunately, I forgot it in the airport in Copenhagen and had to find a replacement once I landed in Tokyo. I ended up buying an Apple charger instead, and although slightly larger, it eliminated the need for a travel adapter which was quite convenient. For daily use where a travel adapter is not necessary, I'd still prefer the Anker, but I might be tempted to use the Apple charger next time I visit Japan or the US as I think it might be nicer at the end of the day to not have to use a travel adapter.\n* Kobo Clara HD\n   * If I am not currently reading a book, I should not bring this in the future, as it is unlikely that I'll start reading one while I am traveling.\n* HDMI cable\n   * I rarely see HDMI cables on other peoples' packing lists, but I appreciate having the option to watch a movie on the tv in the hotel room instead of using my laptop. I'd love to find a braided cable, so if anybody has recommendations, I am all ears.\n\n**Clothing**\n\n* Cable knit sweater\n   * While it provided me with warmth on the flight, I did not end up using it in Japan or Taiwan. It took up significant space in my bag, so I'd love to find a more compact, non-down solution in the future.\n* Clarks desert boots\n   * I've used these extensively over the years both day-to-day as well as during traveling. I have walked in them a lot without experiencing any pain. In the future, I'll likely use a pair of New Balance 996 that I recently purchased, though, as the Clarks are fairly heavy in comparison, and I know the NBs are better for my feet.\n* Boxer shorts\n   * This year, I have slowly moved to using Always in Motion Mesh boxer shorts from Lululemon, and I find them very, very comfortable. Because of the mesh material, I expected that they would dry quickly. To my surprise, however, they were often the last of my clothing to dry, so in the future, I might want to wash them one day earlier than I did on this trip.\n* T-shirts\n   * Since I was able to do laundry, I would probably have brought one or two t-shirts less if I could have done this over. It was good to have a mix of short and long sleeve t-shirts, and I also appreciated having the flannel shirt, but I didn't need four short sleeve t-shirts. A couple of months before the trip, I ended up buying a made-to-order merino t-shirt from Son of a Tailor, as I was curious about the strong appreciation of merino wool here. Ironically, I never used it, as the cotton t-shirts that I normally use worked just as well during traveling as they do at home.\n* LOOW HS-80 socks\n   * Speaking of merino, the LOOW HS-80 socks have to be the true winner of this trip. I was beyond surprised by how comfortable they were, and how they simply did not pick up any odor at all. Although, I also like the merino socks from Asket, they are a bit thinner and probably pairs better with sneakers than desert boots. I cannot praise the LOOW socks enough, and in the future, I'll definitely transition to only using merino socks. I think cotton is more than adequate for my use case, so I'll likely only opt for merino for socks and jumpers going forward.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n* Kodak FunSaver\n   * This was admittedly a bit of an experiment. I wanted to see if I'd enjoy using a disposable camera for my trip. I rarely find myself taking photos, and using this camera didn't change this. Although, I am looking forward to seeing the results once the film has been developed, I am not going to bring this again.\n* Souvenirs\n   * I had not expected to buy more souvenirs than I could fit in my bag given that this was my third trip to Japan. I was therefore a bit surprised when I eventually realized that I needed to find a solution if I wanted to bring home the items I had bought. I stumbled upon [this compact, foldable bag from Muji](https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4550344468418?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=da&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;_x_tr_hist=true) that worked well, and I'll definitely use it next time in case I end up buying more souvenirs that I can fit in my bag.\n* Toiletries pouch\n   * My toiletries pouch from Muji is great from an organizational perspective, and I've been enjoying it a lot. However, I found it a bit bulky this time and inefficient from a space perspective, so I found [this extremely lightweight toiletries pouch from Montbell](https://euro.montbell.com/products/disp.php?cat_id=14025&amp;p_id=1123671) that can fit everything except from my shaver, and I am looking forward to trying it next time.\n\nIn conclusion, this has definitely been an experience full of learnings, and I hope some of you will benefit from I've shared in this post.",

After benefiting immensely from the wealth of knowledge shared here, I wanted to give back to the community by sharing my recent experience traveling with only one bag to Japan and Taiwan for 20 days. My itinerary was Copenhagen &gt; Japan (Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, Osaka) &gt; Taiwan (Taipei) &gt; Japan (Tokyo) &gt; Copenhagen.\n\nThis trip marked a somewhat natural evolution in my travel style. I cannot remember what led me to travel more lightweight, but it started with a 20L suitcase from Muji which I've enjoyed, and I found it freeing to only travel with carry on luggage. In August, I went to Warsaw for five days, and since I was traveling with Wizz Air, I needed to travel even more lightly. So I went with a Fjällräven Kånken which worked surprisingly well. This was my first longer trip with only a single bag, and also the first trip where I had to rely on doing laundry to make it work, however.\n\nI had initially planned to use my Arc'teryx Granville 16 that I bought in July, but I needed to opt for a different bag due to its unbelievably abrasive backpanel that has destroyed one of my shirt jackets and was slowly destroying the back of my jacket too. Sacrificing the waterproofness and look of the Granville 16, I landed on a Refugio 26 from Patagonia instead which I found to fare well. Additionally, I also brought a sling from Uniqlo for daily use which was convenient, although I could have skipped it if I wanted to be a purist.\n\nThe base weight was roughly six kilos, and I am generally happy with how it went. You can see my packing list [here](https://lighterpack.com/r/zxxxpm).\n\nReflecting on the journey, a few insights might prove useful to others:\n\n**Tech**\n\n* MacBook Pro 14\"\n   * If I had asked for feedback on my packing list before I went, I imagine this item would likely be the one that would receive the most comments. I prefer having a laptop in comparison to only using my phone, and I do not own a tablet, so while it is definitely the heaviest item on my packing list, I don't regret it. However, I do miss the days where I could just use my MacBook 12\", so I am tempted to see how expensive it would be to fix it.\n* Anker Prime 67W GaN charger\n   * Amazing compact charger. Unfortunately, I forgot it in the airport in Copenhagen and had to find a replacement once I landed in Tokyo. I ended up buying an Apple charger instead, and although slightly larger, it eliminated the need for a travel adapter which was quite convenient. For daily use where a travel adapter is not necessary, I'd still prefer the Anker, but I might be tempted to use the Apple charger next time I visit Japan or the US as I think it might be nicer at the end of the day to not have to use a travel adapter.\n* Kobo Clara HD\n   * If I am not currently reading a book, I should not bring this in the future, as it is unlikely that I'll start reading one while I am traveling.\n* HDMI cable\n   * I rarely see HDMI cables on other peoples' packing lists, but I appreciate having the option to watch a movie on the tv in the hotel room instead of using my laptop. I'd love to find a braided cable, so if anybody has recommendations, I am all ears.\n\n**Clothing**\n\n* Cable knit sweater\n   * While it provided me with warmth on the flight, I did not end up using it in Japan or Taiwan. It took up significant space in my bag, so I'd love to find a more compact, non-down solution in the future.\n* Clarks desert boots\n   * I've used these extensively over the years both day-to-day as well as during traveling. I have walked in them a lot without experiencing any pain. In the future, I'll likely use a pair of New Balance 996 that I recently purchased, though, as the Clarks are fairly heavy in comparison, and I know the NBs are better for my feet.\n* Boxer shorts\n   * This year, I have slowly moved to using Always in Motion Mesh boxer shorts from Lululemon, and I find them very, very comfortable. Because of the mesh material, I expected that they would dry quickly. To my surprise, however, they were often the last of my clothing to dry, so in the future, I might want to wash them one day earlier than I did on this trip.\n* T-shirts\n   * Since I was able to do laundry, I would probably have brought one or two t-shirts less if I could have done this over. It was good to have a mix of short and long sleeve t-shirts, and I also appreciated having the flannel shirt, but I didn't need four short sleeve t-shirts. A couple of months before the trip, I ended up buying a made-to-order merino t-shirt from Son of a Tailor, as I was curious about the strong appreciation of merino wool here. Ironically, I never used it, as the cotton t-shirts that I normally use worked just as well during traveling as they do at home.\n* LOOW HS-80 socks\n   * Speaking of merino, the LOOW HS-80 socks have to be the true winner of this trip. I was beyond surprised by how comfortable they were, and how they simply did not pick up any odor at all. Although, I also like the merino socks from Asket, they are a bit thinner and probably pairs better with sneakers than desert boots. I cannot praise the LOOW socks enough, and in the future, I'll definitely transition to only using merino socks. I think cotton is more than adequate for my use case, so I'll likely only opt for merino for socks and jumpers going forward.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n* Kodak FunSaver\n   * This was admittedly a bit of an experiment. I wanted to see if I'd enjoy using a disposable camera for my trip. I rarely find myself taking photos, and using this camera didn't change this. Although, I am looking forward to seeing the results once the film has been developed, I am not going to bring this again.\n* Souvenirs\n   * I had not expected to buy more souvenirs than I could fit in my bag given that this was my third trip to Japan. I was therefore a bit surprised when I eventually realized that I needed to find a solution if I wanted to bring home the items I had bought. I stumbled upon [this compact, foldable bag from Muji](https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4550344468418?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=da&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;_x_tr_hist=true) that worked well, and I'll definitely use it next time in case I end up buying more souvenirs that I can fit in my bag.\n* Toiletries pouch\n   * My toiletries pouch from Muji is great from an organizational perspective, and I've been enjoying it a lot. However, I found it a bit bulky this time and inefficient from a space perspective, so I found [this extremely lightweight toiletries pouch from Montbell](https://euro.montbell.com/products/disp.php?cat_id=14025&amp;p_id=1123671) that can fit everything except from my shaver, and I am looking forward to trying it next time.\n\nIn conclusion, this has definitely been an experience full of learnings, and I hope some of you will benefit from I've shared in this post.",

After benefiting immensely from the wealth of knowledge shared here, I wanted to give back to the community by sharing my recent experience traveling with only one bag to Japan and Taiwan for 20 days. My itinerary was Copenhagen &gt; Japan (Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, Osaka) &gt; Taiwan (Taipei) &gt; Japan (Tokyo) &gt; Copenhagen.\n\nThis trip marked a somewhat natural evolution in my travel style. I cannot remember what led me to travel more lightweight, but it started with a 20L suitcase from Muji which I've enjoyed, and I found it freeing to only travel with carry on luggage. In August, I went to Warsaw for five days, and since I was traveling with Wizz Air, I needed to travel even more lightly. So I went with a Fjällräven Kånken which worked surprisingly well. This was my first longer trip with only a single bag, and also the first trip where I had to rely on doing laundry to make it work, however.\n\nI had initially planned to use my Arc'teryx Granville 16 that I bought in July, but I needed to opt for a different bag due to its unbelievably abrasive backpanel that has destroyed one of my shirt jackets and was slowly destroying the back of my jacket too. Sacrificing the waterproofness and look of the Granville 16, I landed on a Refugio 26 from Patagonia instead which I found to fare well. Additionally, I also brought a sling from Uniqlo for daily use which was convenient, although I could have skipped it if I wanted to be a purist.\n\nThe base weight was roughly six kilos, and I am generally happy with how it went. You can see my packing list [here](https://lighterpack.com/r/zxxxpm).\n\nReflecting on the journey, a few insights might prove useful to others:\n\n**Tech**\n\n* MacBook Pro 14\"\n   * If I had asked for feedback on my packing list before I went, I imagine this item would likely be the one that would receive the most comments. I prefer having a laptop in comparison to only using my phone, and I do not own a tablet, so while it is definitely the heaviest item on my packing list, I don't regret it. However, I do miss the days where I could just use my MacBook 12\", so I am tempted to see how expensive it would be to fix it.\n* Anker Prime 67W GaN charger\n   * Amazing compact charger. Unfortunately, I forgot it in the airport in Copenhagen and had to find a replacement once I landed in Tokyo. I ended up buying an Apple charger instead, and although slightly larger, it eliminated the need for a travel adapter which was quite convenient. For daily use where a travel adapter is not necessary, I'd still prefer the Anker, but I might be tempted to use the Apple charger next time I visit Japan or the US as I think it might be nicer at the end of the day to not have to use a travel adapter.\n* Kobo Clara HD\n   * If I am not currently reading a book, I should not bring this in the future, as it is unlikely that I'll start reading one while I am traveling.\n* HDMI cable\n   * I rarely see HDMI cables on other peoples' packing lists, but I appreciate having the option to watch a movie on the tv in the hotel room instead of using my laptop. I'd love to find a braided cable, so if anybody has recommendations, I am all ears.\n\n**Clothing**\n\n* Cable knit sweater\n   * While it provided me with warmth on the flight, I did not end up using it in Japan or Taiwan. It took up significant space in my bag, so I'd love to find a more compact, non-down solution in the future.\n* Clarks desert boots\n   * I've used these extensively over the years both day-to-day as well as during traveling. I have walked in them a lot without experiencing any pain. In the future, I'll likely use a pair of New Balance 996 that I recently purchased, though, as the Clarks are fairly heavy in comparison, and I know the NBs are better for my feet.\n* Boxer shorts\n   * This year, I have slowly moved to using Always in Motion Mesh boxer shorts from Lululemon, and I find them very, very comfortable. Because of the mesh material, I expected that they would dry quickly. To my surprise, however, they were often the last of my clothing to dry, so in the future, I might want to wash them one day earlier than I did on this trip.\n* T-shirts\n   * Since I was able to do laundry, I would probably have brought one or two t-shirts less if I could have done this over. It was good to have a mix of short and long sleeve t-shirts, and I also appreciated having the flannel shirt, but I didn't need four short sleeve t-shirts. A couple of months before the trip, I ended up buying a made-to-order merino t-shirt from Son of a Tailor, as I was curious about the strong appreciation of merino wool here. Ironically, I never used it, as the cotton t-shirts that I normally use worked just as well during traveling as they do at home.\n* LOOW HS-80 socks\n   * Speaking of merino, the LOOW HS-80 socks have to be the true winner of this trip. I was beyond surprised by how comfortable they were, and how they simply did not pick up any odor at all. Although, I also like the merino socks from Asket, they are a bit thinner and probably pairs better with sneakers than desert boots. I cannot praise the LOOW socks enough, and in the future, I'll definitely transition to only using merino socks. I think cotton is more than adequate for my use case, so I'll likely only opt for merino for socks and jumpers going forward.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n* Kodak FunSaver\n   * This was admittedly a bit of an experiment. I wanted to see if I'd enjoy using a disposable camera for my trip. I rarely find myself taking photos, and using this camera didn't change this. Although, I am looking forward to seeing the results once the film has been developed, I am not going to bring this again.\n* Souvenirs\n   * I had not expected to buy more souvenirs than I could fit in my bag given that this was my third trip to Japan. I was therefore a bit surprised when I eventually realized that I needed to find a solution if I wanted to bring home the items I had bought. I stumbled upon [this compact, foldable bag from Muji](https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4550344468418?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=da&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;_x_tr_hist=true) that worked well, and I'll definitely use it next time in case I end up buying more souvenirs that I can fit in my bag.\n* Toiletries pouch\n   * My toiletries pouch from Muji is great from an organizational perspective, and I've been enjoying it a lot. However, I found it a bit bulky this time and inefficient from a space perspective, so I found [this extremely lightweight toiletries pouch from Montbell](https://euro.montbell.com/products/disp.php?cat_id=14025&amp;p_id=1123671) that can fit everything except from my shaver, and I am looking forward to trying it next time.\n\nIn conclusion, this has definitely been an experience full of learnings, and I hope some of you will benefit from I've shared in this post.",

After benefiting immensely from the wealth of knowledge shared here, I wanted to give back to the community by sharing my recent experience traveling with only one bag to Japan and Taiwan for 20 days. My itinerary was Copenhagen &gt; Japan (Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, Osaka) &gt; Taiwan (Taipei) &gt; Japan (Tokyo) &gt; Copenhagen.\n\nThis trip marked a somewhat natural evolution in my travel style. I cannot remember what led me to travel more lightweight, but it started with a 20L suitcase from Muji which I've enjoyed, and I found it freeing to only travel with carry on luggage. In August, I went to Warsaw for five days, and since I was traveling with Wizz Air, I needed to travel even more lightly. So I went with a Fjällräven Kånken which worked surprisingly well. This was my first longer trip with only a single bag, and also the first trip where I had to rely on doing laundry to make it work, however.\n\nI had initially planned to use my Arc'teryx Granville 16 that I bought in July, but I needed to opt for a different bag due to its unbelievably abrasive backpanel that has destroyed one of my shirt jackets and was slowly destroying the back of my jacket too. Sacrificing the waterproofness and look of the Granville 16, I landed on a Refugio 26 from Patagonia instead which I found to fare well. Additionally, I also brought a sling from Uniqlo for daily use which was convenient, although I could have skipped it if I wanted to be a purist.\n\nThe base weight was roughly six kilos, and I am generally happy with how it went. You can see my packing list [here](https://lighterpack.com/r/zxxxpm).\n\nReflecting on the journey, a few insights might prove useful to others:\n\n**Tech**\n\n* MacBook Pro 14\"\n   * If I had asked for feedback on my packing list before I went, I imagine this item would likely be the one that would receive the most comments. I prefer having a laptop in comparison to only using my phone, and I do not own a tablet, so while it is definitely the heaviest item on my packing list, I don't regret it. However, I do miss the days where I could just use my MacBook 12\", so I am tempted to see how expensive it would be to fix it.\n* Anker Prime 67W GaN charger\n   * Amazing compact charger. Unfortunately, I forgot it in the airport in Copenhagen and had to find a replacement once I landed in Tokyo. I ended up buying an Apple charger instead, and although slightly larger, it eliminated the need for a travel adapter which was quite convenient. For daily use where a travel adapter is not necessary, I'd still prefer the Anker, but I might be tempted to use the Apple charger next time I visit Japan or the US as I think it might be nicer at the end of the day to not have to use a travel adapter.\n* Kobo Clara HD\n   * If I am not currently reading a book, I should not bring this in the future, as it is unlikely that I'll start reading one while I am traveling.\n* HDMI cable\n   * I rarely see HDMI cables on other peoples' packing lists, but I appreciate having the option to watch a movie on the tv in the hotel room instead of using my laptop. I'd love to find a braided cable, so if anybody has recommendations, I am all ears.\n\n**Clothing**\n\n* Cable knit sweater\n   * While it provided me with warmth on the flight, I did not end up using it in Japan or Taiwan. It took up significant space in my bag, so I'd love to find a more compact, non-down solution in the future.\n* Clarks desert boots\n   * I've used these extensively over the years both day-to-day as well as during traveling. I have walked in them a lot without experiencing any pain. In the future, I'll likely use a pair of New Balance 996 that I recently purchased, though, as the Clarks are fairly heavy in comparison, and I know the NBs are better for my feet.\n* Boxer shorts\n   * This year, I have slowly moved to using Always in Motion Mesh boxer shorts from Lululemon, and I find them very, very comfortable. Because of the mesh material, I expected that they would dry quickly. To my surprise, however, they were often the last of my clothing to dry, so in the future, I might want to wash them one day earlier than I did on this trip.\n* T-shirts\n   * Since I was able to do laundry, I would probably have brought one or two t-shirts less if I could have done this over. It was good to have a mix of short and long sleeve t-shirts, and I also appreciated having the flannel shirt, but I didn't need four short sleeve t-shirts. A couple of months before the trip, I ended up buying a made-to-order merino t-shirt from Son of a Tailor, as I was curious about the strong appreciation of merino wool here. Ironically, I never used it, as the cotton t-shirts that I normally use worked just as well during traveling as they do at home.\n* LOOW HS-80 socks\n   * Speaking of merino, the LOOW HS-80 socks have to be the true winner of this trip. I was beyond surprised by how comfortable they were, and how they simply did not pick up any odor at all. Although, I also like the merino socks from Asket, they are a bit thinner and probably pairs better with sneakers than desert boots. I cannot praise the LOOW socks enough, and in the future, I'll definitely transition to only using merino socks. I think cotton is more than adequate for my use case, so I'll likely only opt for merino for socks and jumpers going forward.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n* Kodak FunSaver\n   * This was admittedly a bit of an experiment. I wanted to see if I'd enjoy using a disposable camera for my trip. I rarely find myself taking photos, and using this camera didn't change this. Although, I am looking forward to seeing the results once the film has been developed, I am not going to bring this again.\n* Souvenirs\n   * I had not expected to buy more souvenirs than I could fit in my bag given that this was my third trip to Japan. I was therefore a bit surprised when I eventually realized that I needed to find a solution if I wanted to bring home the items I had bought. I stumbled upon [this compact, foldable bag from Muji](https://www.muji.com/jp/ja/store/cmdty/detail/4550344468418?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=da&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;_x_tr_hist=true) that worked well, and I'll definitely use it next time in case I end up buying more souvenirs that I can fit in my bag.\n* Toiletries pouch\n   * My toiletries pouch from Muji is great from an organizational perspective, and I've been enjoying it a lot.

Hydroflask, 3L hydration bladder\n* **Other**: Knit hat, light gloves, bikini, merino gaiter, Ex officio bug repellent bandana, top &amp; shorts for sleeping, patagonia hat, eye mask, sunglasses, Loop earplugs, Eagle Creek collapsible neck pillow, wallet, phone, keys, hairbrush, Nomadix towel, supplements/meds, assorted menstrual products, Target Open Story packable tote (I plan to put my gear in this when I arrive and then use my backpack on hikes)\n\nI will have access to a washing machine about 75% of the way through the trip, but all my tops, underwear, and the shorts can be washed by hand in the sink. My husband is carrying our soap, shampoo, and toothbrushes.\n\nI've had the Refugio for a few months now but have only done some long weekend trips with it. Overall, I really like it! There's not much in the way of organization - a slim rear sleeve for a hydration bladder or laptop, and a vertical-zip front pocket. The rest is just a big open center. I like this, though, as I can easily tetris all my folded and bagged items in there!",

I would totally consider getting a women's version or something in that comparable midweight range in the future.",

                "body": "Ayy hello fellow Wolverine and LSA-er! \n\nYes, the kickstand is built into the bag. Essentially it's a sturdy metal rod that goes up either side of the bag and forms a sort of square bottom that allows the bag to stand on its own. It also acts as a solid frame for the pack making it much nicer to wear, especially given the floating mesh back panel. The biggest downside, especially for onebaggers, is that, given the solid frame, it doesn't compress down. So the dimensions of the pack are pretty much rigid although you can flatten it down a bit. If that doesn't bother you, like it doesn't me, this is a fantastic feature and bag.\n\nOther Osprey packs that have this are the Tropos 34, of which is essentially a larger Parsec, and the Radial 26, which is meant more for bike commuting but shares a lot of similarities with the Parsec and can expand to 34L. Definitely check them out! Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: I'll just add - the kickstand on the newest versions of Osprey packs works great even when empty, although it helps having something in the bag to sort of weight it down. Older versions are notorious for not being able to stand unless the bag has contents to make it heavier to \"activate\" the kickstand. The current version works great though!",

            "body": "Hello all! I recently vacationed for a 4 day weekend, and even though I traveled by car, I decided to use just my one-and-a-half bag setup. If I were properly traveling and not vacationing, I'd skim down and have a different pack list, but figured this would make for a decent enough dry run.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably would've preferred going for the Osprey Radial 26+8 and a packable hip pack or sling, like the matador waist pack. Regardless, the Parsec, which I use as an everyday pack, worked wonderfully here. I was able to shove two medium-sized eagle creek packing cubes into the pack - one into the main compartment, and one into the secondary compartment. If I didn't bring my laptop, it would've been an easier fit, because it was difficult getting them both to fit. It was doable, but I'd look to pack down to make it work better. The pack also carried the weight well, but I don't want to speak to that until I've had to carry it for a significant enough distance. The pack carries similar to a hiking pack which was a huge draw for me, so I'm hoping it'll continue to carry things well. Another great feature of the Parsec is the set of mesh bottle holders on the sides. I shoved a 22oz Hydroflask on one side, and a 40oz on the other side with no trouble at all. And of course, I love the kickstand so the pack stands up on its own. It works perfectly 9 times out of 10, so long as it's on flat and/or solid ground. It did not want to stay upright on my bed, for example.\n\nThe Patagonia has become a sort of EDC pack for me, and worked great here. I used it to carry my electronics and misc gear, along with my Osprey toiletry kit. The kit is fantastic. It carried all my toiletries, has a hook to hang on the wall, and packs down pretty damn small. I probably want to downsize on my GoToobs though, because I've been noticing that they take up a lot of space. I believe I have the 2.5oz bottles, so I'll either downsize to the 1.7oz, or probably just use different bottles altogether. I'm not the biggest fan of them since some of the contents gather around the lid but don't actually come out when you squeeze.\n\nIf you have any recs on places to save space and trim down, feel free to let me know. I already know multiple places I could trim down (like not bringing my laptop), but I'm here for any and all recs.\n\nPacking list:\n\nPACKS AND ORGANIZERS\n\n* Osprey Parsec 26L\n* Patagonia Atom Sling 8L\n* 2x Eagle Creek Medium Dirty/Clean Cubes\n* Tentree Mesh Organizer\n* Osprey Ultralight Toiletry Kit\n\nCLOTES\n\n* Tops\n   * 2x Goodfellow and Co.

                "body": "Ayy hello fellow Wolverine and LSA-er! \n\nYes, the kickstand is built into the bag. Essentially it's a sturdy metal rod that goes up either side of the bag and forms a sort of square bottom that allows the bag to stand on its own. It also acts as a solid frame for the pack making it much nicer to wear, especially given the floating mesh back panel. The biggest downside, especially for onebaggers, is that, given the solid frame, it doesn't compress down. So the dimensions of the pack are pretty much rigid although you can flatten it down a bit. If that doesn't bother you, like it doesn't me, this is a fantastic feature and bag.\n\nOther Osprey packs that have this are the Tropos 34, of which is essentially a larger Parsec, and the Radial 26, which is meant more for bike commuting but shares a lot of similarities with the Parsec and can expand to 34L. Definitely check them out! Highly recommend.\n\nEdit: I'll just add - the kickstand on the newest versions of Osprey packs works great even when empty, although it helps having something in the bag to sort of weight it down. Older versions are notorious for not being able to stand unless the bag has contents to make it heavier to \"activate\" the kickstand. The current version works great though!",

If I were properly traveling and not vacationing, I'd skim down and have a different pack list, but figured this would make for a decent enough dry run.\n\nIn hindsight, I probably would've preferred going for the Osprey Radial 26+8 and a packable hip pack or sling, like the matador waist pack. Regardless, the Parsec, which I use as an everyday pack, worked wonderfully here. I was able to shove two medium-sized eagle creek packing cubes into the pack - one into the main compartment, and one into the secondary compartment. If I didn't bring my laptop, it would've been an easier fit, because it was difficult getting them both to fit. It was doable, but I'd look to pack down to make it work better. The pack also carried the weight well, but I don't want to speak to that until I've had to carry it for a significant enough distance. The pack carries similar to a hiking pack which was a huge draw for me, so I'm hoping it'll continue to carry things well. Another great feature of the Parsec is the set of mesh bottle holders on the sides. I shoved a 22oz Hydroflask on one side, and a 40oz on the other side with no trouble at all. And of course, I love the kickstand so the pack stands up on its own. It works perfectly 9 times out of 10, so long as it's on flat and/or solid ground. It did not want to stay upright on my bed, for example.\n\nThe Patagonia has become a sort of EDC pack for me, and worked great here. I used it to carry my electronics and misc gear, along with my Osprey toiletry kit. The kit is fantastic. It carried all my toiletries, has a hook to hang on the wall, and packs down pretty damn small. I probably want to downsize on my GoToobs though, because I've been noticing that they take up a lot of space. I believe I have the 2.5oz bottles, so I'll either downsize to the 1.7oz, or probably just use different bottles altogether. I'm not the biggest fan of them since some of the contents gather around the lid but don't actually come out when you squeeze.\n\nIf you have any recs on places to save space and trim down, feel free to let me know.

It's a very simple card game wherein you have five decks of five cards upside down, each with varying levels of attack damage, shields which defend all attacks (I believe), and a crown that you are trying to destroy. You flip a card, and if it's an attack card, you choose one of your opponents five decks to attack, and essentially do this back and forward until one of you destroys the other's crown on the bottom of one of the piles.\n\nIt's a very simple game, and comes in such a small package! Each deck comes with two sets of cards, so two decks = four players. I'd recommend for a solid travel and social game!",

        "selftext": "I was looking for a new, short-person-friendly travel bag for shorter trips - 2-4 days. My main travel bag, Tom Bihn Tri-Star, is just too big (33L) for these little trips. My TB synapse 19 sometimes fit everything, but it's my daily office bag and I was getting annoyed having to unpack and repack all my work stuff every time we visited family for a long weekend. I also have a TB synapse 25, and it fits everything well, but I'm only 5'2\" and it's just too long for me. It bounces off my butt with every step I take! \n\nI figured I'd aim roughly for the capacity of the TB 25, but for someone shorter. I've been eyeing Mystery Ranch bags for years - so I was hopinh to try the older Coaulee 25 but literally in the time it took me to decide and submit my REI order, they went out of stock.  So I figured I'd try the Coulee 20 and the Scree 32, to see in person what the differences were between the two lines. And I added the Patagonia Refugio 26 because everyone always talks about their bags.\n\nFirst, let me say - I loved 85% of the Refugio. I like the setup of the pockets, I looooved the pattern, and it seemed to have a truly cavernous capacity. Honestly think it must hold more than 26. But, because it's so big, that means it got heavy easily...waaay too heavy for such puny straps and zero hip-belt. That made it uncomfortable to wear even when not packed full - it just doesn't carry well imo. If they had a version with more robust straps and a hipbelt, I'd buy it immediately. \n\nI realized while trying out the bags that I actually did want a hipbelt for this category, since in these use-case scenarios I wouldn't be carrying a separate purse so I'd like to access my phone, ID, travel docs, wallet etc without taking off the bag.\n\nBoth mystery ranch bgas were so, so, so comfortable. The harness system is adjustbale so I was able to set it perfectly for my torso length (I got the XS/S sizes). The shoulder straps were the perfect width and cushiness to be comfortable but not dig into my armpits or neck. The hipbelt pockets are actually far enough forward to easily access them while wearing the bag. I like the tri-zip and the lid pockets. And they are clearly well-made. Besides size, the only real difference between the two I noticed is that the Coulee has pockets on the outside, whereas the Scree has pockets on the inside. I ended up keeping the Coulee for 2 reasons - first, I realized that since this was for travel and not EDC, I did not need/want pockets on the inside of the bag. I use packing cubes, so I just need an empty space to stack them. Also, having pockets on the outside was nice for stashing a cardigan or a snack.  Second reason was the size - I actually had a specific upcoming trip in mind, a 2 night/3 day retreat at a hotel. I easily fit everything in the Coulee 20, could probably have stuffed in more if I needed. I just don't need 32L for these trips - which I pretty much knew beforehand, but it was still nice to try out the Scree.\n\nI loved the Coulee 20 so much I'm tempted to buy a Coulee 30 for longer trips and retire my TB Tri-Star! I definitely think I made the right choice. It's too bad none of the smaller MR EDC/day bags have adjustable frames, I think they'd be too long for me.",

It ticks most of my likings but during the time traveling with it I found some downsides for my specific use case. That's why I thought switching to the new Eagle Creek Explore 26l might the solution for my needs. There is almost no information about this bag, that's why I need your help.\n\nWhat I disliked about the Black Hole 32l:\n- no side acess to the main compartment (quick acess while bag is on the shoulder)\n- flimsy backpanael with almost not ventilation \n- no strap at the mesh pockets to hold tripods oder fishing rods\n\nWhat I liked about the Black Hole and don't want to miss in other bags:\n- very light\n- looks nice, even in the city\n- very roomy\n\nWhat I usually bring:\n- Patagonia Black Hole Cube - Large (for all my cloth)\n- Patagonia Black Hole Cube - Medium (for underwear)\n- Patagonia Black Hole Cube - Small (as a very small techcase)\n- Peak Design Wash Pouch\n- Small tripod (Ulanzi F38)\nWhen my travel includes fishing i bring a small fishing rod (stored length 55cm) and a small plano box with me.\nThis items should also fit in the Eagle Creek Explore.\n\nAccording to this information, what would you suggest? Do you maybe have experience with the Eagle Creek Explore 26?\n\nThanks.",

While I did use them because they were there, my Columbia sun shirts + bamboo leggings would have done the job just fine when layered with my Smartwool zip-up hoodie and Chickfly bamboo leggings. \n* I would bring an extra pair of shorts. There were some days I wanted to keep wearing shorts but just felt grungy and wanted a fresh pair to wear before sink-washing and drying the others overnight. \n* I should have stuck with my original personal item - the Osprey purse in the original post. As I was leaving I switched to a Kipling crossbody as I thought it would be easier for accessing plane entertainment. It was…but it was annoying the rest of the trip. \n\n**Surprisingly Awesome Item:**\n[This](https://www.target.com/p/packable-tote-blue-open-story-8482/-/A-86391390) Open Story packable tote from Target. Talk about a stealth MVP! It was great for tossing my stuff in when I took my backpack on hikes, packed down super small when not in use, and saved the day when my husband needed a little extra space on the way back. I opened it up, threw my purse and his stuff in there, and used it as my personal item. Loved it; definitely making this part of my usual travel setup.",

I use a waist bag as my daypack, but having the packable tote allowed me to buy food at the grocery store and carry it with me instead of having to eat out all the time. Then I finished my food I’d fold up the packable tote and clip it to my waist pack! I also took along a reusable spoon and fork that were well worth carrying that I’ll do it again. Though I’m definitely taking a reusable straw with me the next time because I don’t like the paper straws many places use now even though I understand and agree with their use. I have a reusable straw I just didn’t think to take it with me. I also used the packable tote as my laundry bag when going between my hotel and the laundry mat. I love the versatility!",

That is unless you plan to haul plenty of larger, heavier loads like winter gear in addition to items you normally take. \nIf you’re to want a pack for city life, 30L might just be too much and you may end up with a cratered look to your backpack because of the unused space. \n\nSo my vote is with the 26L 👍",

                "body": "[This](https://imgur.com/a/DRwamKf) shows the total extent of what was packed in the backpack. I have 2 pack cubes: the larger one is 10L and contains a pair of jeans, a sweater, an overshirt, leggings, and the two dresses stuffed on top (obviously will have to iron these).\n\nThe smaller 5L cube one contains the shirts, all rolled up, plus rolled underwear and a lightweight bra on top (I was wearing another clean bra on the flight, and I'm nowhere above wearing a bra for 2 -- 3 days).\n\nI consolidated all my makeup and toiletries into the little blue bag. Honestly, I could have consolidated it further, but I like choices with regards to color. My skincare routine is easy, but even that I ditched the toner and snail mucin for just face wash, moisturizer, and sunscreen.\n\nHeels were necessary, but the Dyson Air Wrap was the big thing I would have left out. I really should have just paid to get my hair blown out here at Drybar or something. It would have been easier. I packed the shoes in above everything else in separate compartments to make it fit, and squeezed the laptop into its compartment and was ready to rock 'n roll.\n\nETA: I'm a fairly petite person (about 4'11\" and 90 lbs), so my clothes are generally  small and easy to fit into various places. My husband at 6'2\"+ could NEVER do this. One of his sweaters takes up an entire 5L bag. My rehearsal dinner dress I chose specifically because it's black and matches the white heels I'm planning to wear on the wedding day.",

Good for the Christmas road trip, good for a New Year's overnighter (with two bottles of champagne in it), and good as the occasional going to the office bag. \n\nSome random thoughts on the bag:\n\n* I personally think it's a bit smaller than 30 liters, more like 28 but still plenty of space. \n* The straps are comfy and the sternum is a must for me. I also like that the sternum strap is pretty small so it doesn't dangle too much when it isn't clipped. \n* I love the mesh water bottle pockets, they can hold a 1 liter nalgene and this trip I used a CamelBak Chute. Pretty easy to reach back and shove the bottle in/pull it out without taking the bag off.\n* The bottle pockets are also great for hat, gloves, poncho, sunglasses case, etc.\n* It's really like a half clamshell in the main pocket which is nice because you still can just reach in the top quite easily.\n* Minor complaint but I wish the small front pocket had some little mesh elastic pouches for organizing.\n* I also wish the zippered pouch on the tech sleeve had some pen holders.\n* Packing cubes are a must. [I use the eagle creek reveal set](https://www.eaglecreek.com/products/pack-it-reveal-cube-set), specifically the small one laid flat in the bottom (it fits perfectly) and then the medium vertically on top of that to make like an L shape. These two cubes held all the aforementioned clothes (not the Nanopuff).\n* The two little elastic mesh pouches on the tech sleeve are nice for quick access things like headphones or usb cable as you can reach in real quick to get them without removing the sleeve.\n* The bag dries very quickly. I actually had to wash it after a bonfire, done so in the kitchen sink, and it was dry within a few hours with a fan aimed at it.",

No other electronics aside from my phone.\n\nAt first I was a little worried since the measurements as packed showed the bag a little thick front to back and 2 inches too tall (but squishable) however with a little push it fit in the sizer and it had tons of extra room once under the seat, even with a water bottle in the outside pocket.\n\n\nAnecdotal addition: saw a woman with a Cotopaxi Allpa 42 on board, she fit it in the overhead though it was a tight squeeze and the bag wasn't 100% packed.

The outbound flight was about 10 minutes late departing but arrived on time and the return trip was about 30 minutes late departing but 15 minutes late arriving. Both were later in the day flights so minor delays aren't shocking to me. Flight crew was friendly, boarding/disembarking went smoothly, seats were tight but fine enough. Larger folks might want to upgrade to the extra legroom ones\n\n\nThat said, I've read the stories about people being stranded and having seen how the system operates I can see how that would happen. The most obvious thing is that they have such a limited number of flights that it's not like you can get bumped to another one a few hours later. The second thing is that the scheduling is clearly quite tight with no room for error. We're watching those flights get to the gate, disembark, load us, and start taxiing to the runway in like 30 minutes. It's impressive but you can definitely see how it would go wrong.\n\n\nSo when it works it's a pretty great way to fly cheap as long as you're onebagging it since they nickel and dime everything (as long as their limited schedule works for you). Where I wouldn't want to use them is for something important like a wedding or a critical work trip or if it's critical you get back home on a certain day. \n\nHad our flight out been messed up? Oh well, it was just a leisure trip, we'll either go a little later or just skip it. Had the return flight delayed us a couple days we had a buffer before returning to work or we would just take more days off if need be.",

The reds is actually a bright pink, the other a maroon, the red in back a hiking backpack so it's not everday pack. I prefer the ospreys hiking but the red one I've kept so if I have friends visit that want to hike but dont have gear I let them use it. The one blue Osprey is for hiking and the blue (spruce actually) north face is ok but I have matching hoodie so I haven't gotten rid of it. \nAs to the reason why so many it was trial and error starting out on what I liked. Now that I do, this is what I have. Also, different sizes for different needs. \nI dont have a dream back backpack I suppose but I think the Refugio is my favorite so I think I'm happy with what I got. \nGood to know someone else gives away backpacks! I do the same as well.",
