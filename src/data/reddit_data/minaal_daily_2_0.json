The contrast lining is good but it's only in the secret and nested compartments, so the main compartment which sees most of the use is still black inside. Not sure how heavy the old hardware to make the change in weight worth noting. I do appreciate the more subtle logo. Curiously they didn't seem to address any of the critiques/suggestions from the packhacker review of the 1.0: A small clip or tightening mechanism on the side flaps would help it wear closer to your body, the zips look good but are a little small, turning the corner on the zips can be a little difficult. Note that I noticed all these issues when I first got the sling, but after using it a bit I haven't had any issues with how it fits, the zip size, or opening the sling, so maybe once you get the hang of it those \"issues\" go away.",

After a good cleaning and a refreshed DWR coating, I can confirm that I was dumb and wrong, the materials here are very good. It cleaned up and looks brand new. The 420d is plenty durable, and held up to at least a year of good use from its previous owner. \nI picked up the Aer CPP for Black Friday, and this acquisition brings my backpack count to 3, so hopefully I’m done. \nNow to hunt for patches, and other fun ways to personalize my CTB26.

            "author": "SaddleSC",
            "body": "**AER DAY PACK 2 REVIEW: PERFECT MINIMAL EDC**\n\nMy new Aer Day Pack 2 arrived a couple of weeks ago, so I thought I would post some initial impressions and a short review for anyone on the fence.\n\n**WHAT MAKES THIS BAG SPECIAL?**\n\n**MATERIALS + BUILD**: all Aer bags that I have owned have impeccable build-quality and this bag is no exception. The Day Pack 2 has perfect stitch lines, no loose threads, and it features a unique, water-resistant textile on the front panel.\n\nPerhaps most impressive is the thick foam padding used to construct both the quick-access pocket as well as the entire laptop sleeve. The best way to describe both of these compartments is that they are built-in soft cases. I no longer feel the need to use either a laptop sleeve or a hard case for my sunglasses because the padding and liner fabric on the Day Pack 2 is so robust.\n\nThe top handle is also one of the best top handles I have ever used. As I said in my Bellroy Apex review, sometimes the feel of the handles can make or break the user experience. In this case, Aer does everything right. The handle is constructed of a thick stitched seatbelt material with memory foam inside that feels great in the hand. It is what every bag maker should emulate.\n\n**COMPACT SIZE**: I carry a MBP13 or an iPad Pro 11, a Kindle Oasis, a light jacket, snacks, tech support cables, hard drive, and a bottle of water. I also typically need a binder or book and this bag handles those things with ease. I am 5’10” and was worried the bag would appear too small, but it definitely has enough presence on the back to look great. The other advantage of its compact size will be increased leg room under the seat when airline travel resumes.\n\n**STANDS ON ITS OWN**: this bag was designed to stand on its own and it is the most stable bag I have ever used in that regard. No matter how it is loaded, it will stand solidly on its base right by a chair or on the table, always ready for action.\n\n**FRONT** **ADMIN PANEL**: the admin panel in the front compartment features a great layout with just the right number of pockets. I put my MBP charger and cable in the two bottom pockets, my iPhone in the top pocket, pens in the middle, my keys attached to the lanyard, and my wallet/passport in the zippered compartment. Even with those items, there is still plenty of room for a legal pad or notebook in the front compartment as well. It is a one-stop-shop for all your gear without needing to open a secondary tech pouch, which I have found to be a game-changer during the workday.\n\n**VALUE PROPOSITION**: This bag retails for $140 directly from Aer and with a 20% coupon that is periodically offered on holidays (most recently Memorial Day), this bag can be had for $112. When you consider the materials, the warranty, the build quality, and the unique look, the value proposition is off the charts. If your daily carry fit into the smaller size of the Day Pack 2 vs the Tech Pack 2 ($210) this bag is the clearly the value champion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT IS SUB-OPTIMAL?**\n\nThe only place I can fault this bag is that it lacks a side handle. I would love to be able to pick the bag up in a “traditional briefcase” orientation. However, because the internal layout is completely geared towards top access, the side handle is not really necessary. Also, you can solve this “problem” by stepping up in size to the Tech Pack 2, which does include a side handle.\n\nThe Day Pack 2 is a small enough bag that the top handle is more than sufficient. However, where the lack of a side handle becomes most apparent is if you use the luggage passthrough on the back of the bag. A side handle on the Day Pack would make it much easier to quickly install and remove the pack onto your suitcase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WHAT IS DIFFERENT THAN I EXPECTED?**\n\nWhen I ordered the bag, I did not really know what to expect from the textile used on the front panel. Was it going to be stiff and rubbery like my Black Ember Citadel? Was it going to be loud and crinkly like VX sailcloth? When the bag arrived, I was pleased to find that the material feels very robust, while at the same time being pliable and quiet. It also uses a grey backing fabric and when combined with the ballistic nylon on the sides, gives the bag a very identifiable look that I really enjoy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION: THE PERFECT MINIMAL EDC?**\n\nWhat is the bottom line? I absolutely love this bag. If you want to carry around just the essentials in a well-organized way using a great looking bag with impeccable build quality, it would be darn near impossible to beat this bag.\n\nIt is my new go-to EDC bag, having temporarily retired other heavy hitters in my collection like the CPL24, GR1, GR0, Peak Designs 20L, MW Rhake VX, etc.\n\nI hope this review helps give you a better idea of what this bag is all about…please feel free to ask any questions you may have…thanks!",

The Flight Pack is a bit more travel oriented and the Day Pack is clearly targeted at daily office use, but there is definitely some overlap there.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1j5o9w3/cant_decide_on_a_backpack/",
        "selftext": "Trying to decide on these backpacks for my new backpack for uni but I have no clue what I want or what the general consensus on these bags are, since I don't hear too much about these bags above. \n\nThe bag would be used for uni, 4 days a week, don't have too many textbooks but I have a 20L backpack and it frequently gets filled with the amount of random stuff I take with me everywhere. Ideally it would also be able to hold some stuff if I wanted to go on a day trip too, as I frequently head into regional towns in my state for a day and come back again (so holding stuff like snacks, water, stuff to do, book etc for the day, alongside stuff I need to do uni work on the trains and that). \n\nThe issue I have with my current bag is that the zip keeps breaking. I bought a large Doughnut Macaroon and I love it's design sm, the size is nice too, but the zip broke and I got it exchanged. Then later on, the zipper on the second Doughnut Macaroon bag broke as well, within a year. I've tried fixing it with pliers and that but it always ends up breaking. So as much as I love the bag I desperately need something else. Especially something that has really sturdy zippers. I don't know if I'm very rough with them, or perhaps the quality is just getting worse on things now. \n\nPrice really isn't too much of an issue for me so long as it lasts, I'd much rather pay $300 for a bag that lasts me 4 years than buy a $120 one each year. But ofc a cheap good quality bag would be ideal. In terms of the volume, I am really not sure. I should be able to carry my stuff in a 20L bag but I just take so much with me everyday that I kinda want a little more than that, but still not miss out on it looking like an everyday, uni backpack. \n\nI also like waterproofing since Melbourne weather is incredibly temperamental and will rain in an instant, without any notice. I also like aesthetics, something that doesn't look too hikery (although I do love the way hiker backpacks have numerous wires and things to hang keychains and carabiners off of). Bellroy backpacks are pretty popular here for 9-5 office workers since they usually look sleek and professional, but I'm just not sure about the quality. I would love to be able to use my backpack once I've graduated and am in the work force as well, and not have it look too out of place. \n\nSo please let me know if anyone has had any experiences with the backpacks above. Or if they have any similar backpack recommendations? These are the ones I've found in my scouring but perhaps there are some niche ones I've missed out there that are better. \n\nAlso note : the prices are in AUD, so imagine them a bit lower if using USD.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/9q5kyt/packing_cubes_for_the_minaal_carryon_20/",
        "selftext": "The optional Minaal packing cubes are quite pricey at $49USD and you definitely don’t need to use them. The Minaal site doesn’t give dimensions on the size of the open clamshell side of the Carry-on 2.0. So what are the dimensions, and what other packing cubes will fit in this pack? This post will delve into some packing cube options for the Minaal 2.0, [visit my site](https://onebagtravels.com/minaal-2-0-review/) for a full review of this pack and a packing demo video.\n\nFirst, the optional Minaal cubes are sold in a set of 3 cubes for $49 with 1 large, and 2 small cubes. They are designed to fit inside the Carry-on 2.0, or the Daily Bag. They are made from silnylon ripstop fabric on the bottom, and a thin mesh on top. The set weighs a total of 5.29 oz.\n\n* Large (x1): 33 x 18 x 10cm (13” x 7.1” x 3.9”)\n* Small (x2): 21 x 15 x 10cm (8.2”x 5.9” 3.9”)\n* Total length of all 3 cubes = 18 + 21 = 39cm (15.4”)\n* Total width = 33cm (large) or 30cm (both smalls side by side)\n\nThe approximate dimensions of the large side of the main compartment (the “scoop”) are 45.7 x 35.6cm (L=18” x W=14”). Here are some pictures with a ruler to show the total dimensions of large side of compartment. The [length](https://i.imgur.com/cf0AGXj.jpg) and the [width](https://i.imgur.com/e8LysGH.jpg):.\n\n**Note**: I removed the rain cover for all of these photos, it creates a weird bulge on the bottom of the pack, and tends to get in the way. It makes your use of space less efficient if using packing cubes. If you are going to use the rain cover, I would probably just stick it inside your bag, or inside a packing cube (in a zip lock if it’s wet).\n\nHere is a reference picture of the bag packed with the [Minaal cube set](https://i.imgur.com/mP29veE.jpg), one Large (33 x 18 x 10 cm) plus two Small (21 x 15 x 10 cm). Total dimension of all 3 cubes is (39 x 33 x 10 cm / 15.4” x 13”). These cubes are actually smaller than the dimensions of the scoop (18” x 14”), but because they are soft, you could overstuff them to take up more space.\n\nI tried out some of my packing cubes to see how they fit in the pack in different configurations:\n\n* Eagle Creek Medium (4 oz) = 36 x 25.5 x 8 cm (14” x 10” x 3”) 4oz\n* Eagle Creek Small (2.5 oz) = 25.5 x 18 x 8 cm (10” x 7” x 3”)\n* Eagle Creek clean dirty cube (6 oz) = 36 x 25.4 x 10 cm (14”x 10” x 4”)\n* Hynes Eagle Large= 46 x 33 x 8.4 cm (18.1” x 13” x 3.3”)\n\nYou can fit [2 Eagle Creek Medium cubes](https://i.imgur.com/pJ3APFK.jpg) (total dimensions 36 x 50.8cm / 14” x 20”) inside the scoop, but they are slightly squished. The second cubes makes the configuration about 2” too tall. Total weight = 8 oz.\n\nThis [next picture](https://i.imgur.com/TXlrT5J.jpg) shows just a medium Eagle Creek cube (36 x 25.5 x 8 cm / 14” x 10” x 3”) with space on the top. And [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/WOCC2h9.jpg) shows one Eagle Creek Medium plus Small (25.5 x 18 x 8 cm / 10” x 7” x 3”). Total dimensions are (43.4 x 36 cm / 17.1” x 14”). They fit in almost perfectly, with a small gap on top.\n\nThe pictured Eagle Creek cubes are also slightly thinner at 8cm (3.2”) than you can get away with. It might be more appropriate to use the Eagle Creek Clean Dirty Cube (M). It is the same width and length of the Original medium cube, but is slightly deeper at 10 cm (4”).\n\nIf you are looking for one big cube, the large size packing cube from Hynes Eagle (46 x 33 x 8.4 cm /18.1” x 13” x 3.3”) actually [fits in the scoop great](https://i.imgur.com/ym1hoie.jpg), but doesn’t allow room for any other cubes. These are super cheap at less than $20, but you can only buy them in a 3 piece set.\n\nWhat cubes do you use for this bag? ",

Defeats the purpose of a rain cover if you have to open your bag in the pouring rain to get to it.\n\nAgreed though – there's nothing special about the Minaal packing cubes.  I've had better results with the Eagle Creek compression cubes.  The medium Specter / Specter Tech compression cube packed to its maximum just about fits sideways into the Minaal Daily, leaving a decent amount of space above it.\n\n\n",

It's still a 3 (could easily be 5) day work trip:\n\n* Peak Design Medium cube\n   * 1 [Lululemon ABC Warpstreme](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/mens-trousers/ABC-Pant-Classic-30/_/prod9640029?color=48432&amp;sz=40) 40x30 pant\n   * 4 Merino T-shirts (Outlier, Woolly, Merino Tech)\n   * 2 Cotton/Pique Polos\n   * 1 Bamboo pajama bottom\n   * 2 Woolly boxers\n   * 2 pairs of [Darn Tough socks](https://darntough.com/collections/men/products/mens-hiker-variety-3-pack?variant=37290122576058)\n* [CPAP](https://www.breas.us/en-US/products/sleep-therapy/z2-auto) and hoses (I really want to get [https://www.inspiresleep.com/](https://www.inspiresleep.com/) one day)\n* [Aer Split Kit](https://aersf.com/products/split-kit)\n   * 1 3-port [Anker GaN charger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09W2N774C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n   * 1 USB-C [Apple (I think) charger](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ)\n   * 1 Apple [USB-C to MagSafe cable](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLYV3AM-A-USB-C-Magsafe/dp/B09JR6YFQT)\n   * 1 USB-C [multi-port (Lightning, USB-C, iWatch) cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CJ9FBTRR)\n* [Aer Travel Kit 2](https://aersf.com/products/travel-kit-2) w/Toiletries\n* 2 [Tom Bihn Ghost Whale pouches](https://www.tombihn.com/collections/accessories/products/ghost-whale-organizer-pouch?variant=42603108139197) with bars &amp; tea bags\n* 16\" MacBook Pro\n* [Tom Bihn Side Hustle](https://www.tombihn.com/products/side-hustle?variant=43859349668029) (quick grab bag for the plane)\n   * 11\" iPad Pro\n   * Apple AirPods Max headphones\n   * [Sea to Summit Inflatable travel pillow](https://www.rei.com/product/150317/sea-to-summit-aeros-premium-traveller-pillow)\n   * [Matador Travel eye mask](https://www.rei.com/product/233882/matador-blackout-sleep-mask-and-earplugs)\n   * misc: wipes, lens cleaning wipes, computer glasses \n\n# What I've added on for the additional volume:\n\n* A pair of [On Cloudflyer 4](https://www.amazon.com/ON-On-Cloudflyer-4-Mens/dp/B0C56QV336) Size 11 Wide\n* A pair of [Crestwood Mid Waterproof](https://www.zappos.com/p/mens-columbia-crestwood-mid-waterproof-black-charcoal/product/9244542/color/133) Size 11 Wide\n\nBoth pairs of shoes are in shoe bags because that's the way I would realistically pack (and no there is no real reason I can think of I would actually pack these both on a trip).\n\nI didn't go for a water bottle this time around because... I forgot.  We've seen enough of the water bottle pockets of these bags, though.\n\nSo, let's get into it!\n\n# Aer Travel Pack 3: [https://imgur.com/a/nZjmghj](https://imgur.com/a/nZjmghj)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzswftdcqn3d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ef710528805505b66b5255b61af7a086766e58\n\nThe TP3 did well.  I did have to use the secondary compartment as there is useful space available in there.  I should've rearranged so the Side Hustle is on top or in the admin panel, but this was what I could do quickly.  The main compartment is fairly tall which made it relatively easy to pack shoes in there.  I think the TP3 is an admirable bag and holds up well.  There is still room if I need to fit anything small in the main compartment (like in between the big items).\n\n# Evergoods CTB35: [https://imgur.com/a/DwSQZ3J](https://imgur.com/a/DwSQZ3J)\n\n\n\n[Y'all order your patches from Alpinehound, right?](https://preview.redd.it/goithjlrvn3d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14a3b57f7a2a9cf3138694411d6e3bbc12697bfb)\n\nFunny story.  I grabbed my CTB35, packed it with the previous packing list and got the one pair of On Cloudflyer shoes in.  Got it all closed up and wondered if that was really all another 5L should fit.  As I went to see how much space I still had available in the front dump and slash pockets, I couldn't find the dump pocket.  That's when I realized I had grabbed the CPL28!  I was very pleasantly surprised and reminded how spacious the CPL28 is!\n\nAnyways... The CTB35 took some effort to get fully closed up and the laptop compartment was NOT happy.  However, with some optimization, I'm sure I could've made this an easier pack.  I didn't use the front slash, dump, or the yoke pockets so I had a lot of extra ways to optimize the pack and have some extra room.  So, yet another Evergoods bag showing how it exceeds expectations!\n\nNote: I'm really appreciating all the Evergoods bags with their little zipper-pulling-leverage-point-thingies.  Even though it was tough to close, it was made so much more easy by having somewhere to hold.  I am starting to dislike bags that don't give me a leverage point.\n\nAnother note: The cat was all over me today.  I think she might take 2-3L - I don't think she'd fit today!\n\nAnd now, the reason I've gathered you all here today...\n\n# ULA Dragonfly 36: [https://imgur.com/a/HNQPR6O](https://imgur.com/a/HNQPR6O)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khkaebwsvn3d1.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b11ff848c774b408b44629f5bf26e4a1ec6c6a9\n\nThe Dragonfly *almost* kept up with the other bags.  I think the Ghost Whale pouch with the CPAP hoses probably would've fit inside, but I initially forgot to pack it so I threw it in a side mesh pocket (isn't that what those are for?).  The Slim Pouch with the power adapters wasn't really fitting inside so I put in the front mesh pocket, which was fine (though bulgy).  I didn't hate it but I don't really like using that front mesh pocket.  This is the only bag that really didn't have extra room.\n\nSo... now what?  All the bags fit about the same, we all know they're all great bags, so what do I keep and what do I sell/return??  I think the CTB35 is in the permanent collection (for now).  The TP3 can be sold and the Dragonfly 36 could be sold or returned.  Lemme know your thoughts in the comments!",

        "selftext": "EDIT: Thanks for the questions, everyone. As of today (3/16/19), I'm done with this thread. Hope it was helpful! \n\nHello, fellow one-baggers!  I posted a little over a week ago, asking about this bag.  There are no reviews online yet, but it checked a lot of boxes for me so I went ahead and bought it.  It is available on eBags, who in addition to their recurring sales offer a 25% off coupon for first-time purchases.  I think this extends to the whole order, though I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAnyway, my wife and I are planning a 2-week trip to Europe this summer, and already own a Minaal 2.0 that we've used on various jaunts abroad.  We love it!  Unfortunately, I can't afford $300+ for a second one, so I was looking for something that was similar without breaking the bank.  When all was said and done, I paid around $125 for the Thule.    I'll include the Minaal in a couple pictures for reference and comparisons.\n\n**First my likes** (and be forewarned, there are many!):\n\n* **The security features of the bag.**  The Landmark has a couple minor details that really make this, in my humble opinion, a very secure bag for traveling:\n   * The main compartment has a \"hidden\" zippered pocket at the top, directly underneath the SafeZone (I'll just use the names that Thule has given the bag's features) compartment.  The zipper can easily be hidden, and it is perfect for hiding valuables that you don't need immediate access to - travel documents, passport, extra cash, etc.\n   * Any one of the four compression straps on the outside of the bag can be aligned to pass through the loops attached to the zippers of the main compartment.  These zippers are also lockable.\n   * Finally, the zippers on the SafeZone compartment at the top of the bag have loops that can be threaded through a small plastic piece to deter thieves.  The SafeZone compartment also opens backwards, that is, the hinge is not right next to your back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The SafetyZone zippers affixed by a small plastic bit.  Nice theft deterrent. ](https://i.redd.it/au4dg9vmssi21.jpg)\n\n[Threading exterior compression strap through loops attached to the main zippers, which are also lockable if you buy a lock separately.  ](https://i.redd.it/fqra8hwmssi21.jpg)\n\n[Threaded and clipped.  ](https://i.redd.it/k42wea1nssi21.jpg)\n\n[Kind of hard to see, but this is the internal secret stash pocket.  Top of the interior compartment, just underneath the SafetyZone pocket. ](https://i.redd.it/rrvepqvmssi21.jpg)\n\n* Unlike the clamshell-style Minaal, **the Thule opens like a duffel bag**.\n   * This worried me at first, since duffels with backpack straps typically carry like... Duffels with backpack straps, and not a true backpack.  However, once I loaded it up with approximately a week's worth of clothes and carried it around the house, it felt fine.\n   * Much like a duffel, you can shove your shit in this fairly easily.  I had about four medium packing cubes and my dop kit in the bag and also shoved my Chacos and a jacket in, and felt like I could fit more if necessary.\n   * There are two internal compression straps.  These are useful for locking everything in place, though I will definitely be using my packing cubes in the future.\n   * The four exterior compression straps I mentioned before each attach to the duffel opening.  The female ends of the clips are recessed into the opening panel, offering a clean look.  There are also loops on the sides of the bag you can use to organize the straps.\n* **The straps and hip belt can be stowed**.\n   * I have seen the guys at PackHacker call this the #danglefreelife or something similar, but it was one of the things I was looking for in a bag.  To stow, you simply unclip the shoulder straps, undo the hip belt, and shove into the openings at the top and bottom of the bag.\n   * The straps are pretty well-padded, as is the back of the bag.  I won't know for sure until I get a chance to travel with the bag (next month, likely), but I suspect they will acquit themselves well.  In terms of thickness, the straps feel almost exactly the same as those on the Minaal.\n* **The laptop compartment** is well-padded, and has room for both a tablet and a laptop.\n* **The SafeZone pocket** at the top of the bag has a hard shell, useful for protecting delicate items like your phone, sunglasses, etc.  It also has some webbing for organization, and is fleece-lined.\n* **There are no garish colors**.  I looked at one of the Osprey bags at REI last month, can't recall if it was the Farpoint or a similar model, and the inside of the bag was some neon caca that made me want to throw up.  This bag has a pretty tasteful interior, a light brown with a vague triangular pattern.  I'm a dad, dammit - I don't need no neon.\n* **The water bottle pocket** fit my HydroFlask pretty well, and zips away if you don't need it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[My Minaal 2.0 and the Thule side by side.  The Minaal is a bit taller. ](https://i.redd.it/rvmthhr5tsi21.jpg)\n\n[Open and empty.  You can see the internal compression straps.  You'll probably want to use packing cubes with this given the lack of internal organization.  All parts of the interior compartment are easily accessible. ](https://i.redd.it/2aopufs5tsi21.jpg)\n\n[Minaal and Thule side by side opened, so you can appreciate the difference between the two designs.  The sticker on the top of the Thule has not been removed yet.  ](https://i.redd.it/4t885tr5tsi21.jpg)\n\n**On to dislikes!**  I do consider a lot of these minor qualms, and not enough to warrant returning the bag.\n\n* **The laptop compartment zipper is the only zipper on the bag that doesn't have some kind of security device**.  A bit of an oversight, in my opinion.\n* The part of the laptop compartment that I assume is for a tablet has a false bottom; the other section does not.  No biggie; you can probably slip a few pairs of socks or (clean) undies at the bottom to make up for this.  #nopooponthelaptop\n* **The straps are a wee bit problematic**:\n   * Stowing them is a bit of a chore.  You have to really shove them in and I worry that over time, this could cause an issue.  However, the openings have reinforced stitching and after some experimentation I discovered that it works better to stash the hip belt first, followed by the shoulder straps.  In comparison, the Minaal has a fabric panel that zips shut over the straps, is quick and easy to use, and has a much cleaner look.\n   * There is no adjuster near the top of the straps.  This could be an issue with heavier loads.\n   * The clip that attaches the shoulder straps to the bottom is plastic, and doesn't seem to be heavy duty.  If it breaks, your bag is going to be out of commission until you replace it.\n   * I had to adjust the sternum strap (which is removable, but I don't feel like there is any danger of losing it) to the largest option for it to feel comfortable.  For reference, I am a skosh under 5'11\", and have a bit of a barrel chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[All straps stowed. ](https://i.redd.it/sve3bwantsi21.jpg)\n\n[Hip belt stowed, shoulder straps half in and half out. ](https://i.redd.it/b7awmy7ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[One issue - the shoulder strap is secured by one plastic clip.  If it breaks, you are officially F'd in the A.](https://i.redd.it/0be0su8ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[Straps fully deployed!](https://i.redd.it/r5ydwh8ntsi21.jpg)\n\n[Ther sternum strap is adjustable and removable. ](https://i.redd.it/s34520entsi21.jpg)\n\n* **I wish the bottom of the bag were reinforced**.  My daily backpack is some old Timbuk2 thing I inherited from a friend of a friend, and the heavy-duty bottom has saved my stuff on more than one occasion.\n\n**Overall** \\- pretty pleased with the purchase.  This isn't perfect, but is pretty darn close and will work great for me.  I think I got a great bag for not a ton of money, and I look forward to taking it on trips both at home and abroad.  If anyone has any questions, fire away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Here a couple pictures of the bag packed, per request:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bag packed \\(with pillows\\)](https://i.redd.it/o68f2o0n8yi21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Side view of packed bag.
