Then about 13 miles into the Ochocos, where we camped in National Forest land.\n\nThe paved climb is incredibly quiet once you get out of Prineville, then turns to gravel at the summit. We saw no cars for about a day and a half.\n\nThere were four river crossings, which were knee deep at the highest. If it rains, this route wouldn’t be fun, because after the fourth creek crossing there’s PB mud for a few miles. It would be miserable.\n\nWe stopped for snacks at the ghost town of Ashwood (bring cash), and then camped by the John Day river.\n\nThe next day we took it slow and stopped at the Painted Hills before sleeping at the Spoke’n Hostel in Mitchell and getting a beer and a burger at the brewery. What a great little town!\n\nThe final day we wanted to head up and over Mt Pisgah (6400 feet, the highest point on the route) which turned out to be snow covered for a couple of miles. We pushed our bikes through snow. There is a go around, but we were stubborn. 🙂\n\nThen the most glorious paved downhill into Prineville. Eventually you rejoin the highway, which is annoying because it has a bad shoulder. But the first part of that downhill is heaven!",

If it rains, this route wouldn’t be fun, because after the fourth creek crossing there’s PB mud for a few miles. It would be miserable.\n\nWe stopped for snacks at the ghost town of Ashwood (bring cash), and then camped by the John Day river.\n\nThe next day we took it slow and stopped at the Painted Hills before sleeping at the Spoke’n Hostel in Mitchell and getting a beer and a burger at the brewery. What a great little town!\n\nThe final day we wanted to head up and over Mt Pisgah (6400 feet, the highest point on the route) which turned out to be snow covered for a couple of miles.

Then about 13 miles into the Ochocos, where we camped in National Forest land.\n\nThe paved climb is incredibly quiet once you get out of Prineville, then turns to gravel at the summit. We saw no cars for about a day and a half.\n\nThere were four river crossings, which were knee deep at the highest. If it rains, this route wouldn’t be fun, because after the fourth creek crossing there’s PB mud for a few miles. It would be miserable.\n\nWe stopped for snacks at the ghost town of Ashwood (bring cash), and then camped by the John Day river.\n\nThe next day we took it slow and stopped at the Painted Hills before sleeping at the Spoke’n Hostel in Mitchell and getting a beer and a burger at the brewery. What a great little town!\n\nThe final day we wanted to head up and over Mt Pisgah (6400 feet, the highest point on the route) which turned out to be snow covered for a couple of miles. We pushed our bikes through snow. There is a go around, but we were stubborn. 🙂\n\nThen the most glorious paved downhill into Prineville. Eventually you rejoin the highway, which is annoying because it has a bad shoulder. But the first part of that downhill is heaven!",

            "body": "**INTRO**\n\nI had been searching for something smaller to replace my Aer Dopp Kit 2. Its a terrific piece of kit, but its size makes me want to carry more than I need. and packed into my bag, it takes up a considerable portion of space. So, went on a holiday sale tear and took a look at several dopp kits of various shapes and sizes.\n\n**Review Criteria:**\n\n* smaller, flatter shape: wanna be able to pack it easily into my Aer Travel Pack 2, namely the front pocket to keep it away from anything else in case of spillage.\n* design: if i'm paying more for a ziplock bag, i'd want some thoughtful materials and org\n* easy to clean: i'm a messy person, but love a clean bag\n* accessibility: how easy is it to get to my ish\n* fun factor: as a manybagger, that's why we here!\n\n1-5 pts each criteria for a possible total of 25 pts.\n\n**Toiletries:**\n\n1. matador soap case (hair/body bar)\n2. matador flatpak (face wash)\n3. matador flatpak (hair conditioner)\n4. quip floss kit\n5. humangear stax (face lotion)\n6. humangear stax (clay pomade)\n7. tooth brush\n8. mini toothpaste\n9. 7” comb\n10. mini deodorant\n\nI'll go in the order I received and tried them. Mind you, I've only traveled a few times since with one or two of them, so not alot of time with them, but I did try to \"live\" out of them for a few days in my bathroom to get a feel.\n\nI actually ended up with a surprising pic!\n\n**Peak Designs Wash Pouch Small**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 1\n* design: 4\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 4\n\nTotal: 15 pts\n\nI wanted to really like this pouch. First glance, its a gorgeous little dopp kit. Best looking of the bunch by a long shot with its sage green outer shell and herringbone like interior liner.\n\nAnd it was markedly smaller than the aer. Really loved the materials and funky shape. super unique and fun to use. lots of pockets, and loved how i could clean it so easily with the pull out tabs. and most of all, i liked the smaller footprint on my counter. the metal hook is a terrific touch.\n\nbut the materials really stood out to me. wonderful handfeel! made me want a larger backpack! was definitely the fanciest and nicest bag of the bunch.\n\nunfortunately, while the shape was fun to hold and look at, it was kinda awkward to use. the criss cross pockets looked cool, and i liked how it held the bag together while open. but each pocket didnt really feel as useful: smaller ones too small, big ones not big enough? and maybe it needed breaking in, but it wouldnt quite open as i'd like, nor sit on the counter stable.\n\nbut the real kicker was the odd shape, which made it pack not much better than my dopp 2. sure, its smaller, but when fully loaded, the bulgy odd triangular tube shape took up room in my bag in such a way that it didnt let the other items in my bag sit together as neatly. and did NOT pass front pocket test. i could wedge it in there, but it was pretty ugly.\n\n**Matador Flatpak Case (The non-zippered one.)**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 5\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 19 pts\n\nI purchased this after really loving their smaller flatpaks that i regularly use for travel. When i got it, was surprised at how big it was. and yet, given that its a rolltop, it can scrunch down pretty small.\n\nEasily fit all my tolietries, but not only that the big open top made it really easy to get to everything. and the material allowed light to shine thru, so i could see everything quickly and easily. Its just a big ol' bag made of super high tech materials.\n\nbest of all, i got this due to the dry-through tech. I travel with a scrub towel, and love how the membrane was able to dry thru it!\n\nThe flatter design was great too for packing into my bag no matter how much i dumped into it. and its the lightest weight of the bunch.\n\nbut after a while, the detailed organizer in me would have liked some pockets to keep things nicely separated. and would have been nice to separate the wash cloth from other items and not gunk up the other items while it dried inside.\n\nalso, while it takes up little space on a tight sink, and stands up ok, it does tend to slump over when full. i had stuff spill out all over my bathroom floor a few times using it. and i do like the loop, but a hook would have been much preferred.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Slim**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 5\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 17 pts\n\nAnother bag i really wanted to love. had a super flat shape. and loved all the pockets! so many cool places to put various things. and i liked the loop / hook design which made it really easy to hang.\n\nThe materials were MUCH nicer in hand. in pictures and videos, just looks like any other plastic'y nylon material. but in hand, feels much more luxe and soft and doesnt chaff. i really like it. and best of all, when packed, it fit super nicely in the front pocket of my aer travel pack 2.\n\nbut ultimately for me, each pocket was just a little too tight. and while the materials were easy to clean, the various tight pockets made it actually hard to clean. and due to the open face design, its made to be hanging from your towel rack. and it takes up alot of counterspace, especially when folded out.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Mini**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 4\n* accessibility: 3\n* fun factor: 5\n\nTotal: 20 pts\n\nI thought I was going to hate this little guy. Seems kinda fat, and its just two pockets. why bother? and yet, every review i read or heard kept on touting how great it was, so i reluctantly purchased it. but over time using it, i realized, this might be the one!\n\nAs like the explorer slim, love the materials. solid, robust, and luxe. in hand, just felt great and much better than expected.\n\nReally like the rubberized handles and zipper pulls, and the loop makes it easy to hang and place in any cramped space. Nevermind, helpful to pull from my pack. a rubber loop seems innocuous, but really made the bag fun to use.\n\nIts not much bigger than a large pencil case and sure, just two simple pockets. but that's all i really needed. fit all my toiletries with a packed but comfy fit. only once, did i have to do a full bag dump. the zippers open up rather wide to help you really dig into it.\n\noverall, as definitely smallest of the lot, it could fit anywhere in my travel pack without taking up too much space. the rectangular shape lent itself to any packing tetris, as it felt half the size of my old aer dopp kit 2. And it soft materials lends itself to a real smush if need be.\n\nbest of all, its only a touch thicker than the explorer slim, and whaddya know, fit the front pocket ok! if the main compartment is packed, it is pretty tight, but it can work.\n\nAnd since its just two pockets, made it really easy to clean and wash after the week's \"trip\".\n\nMy own issues are the black interior. would be nice to have something hi-vis ish. And if its really packed, accessibility does take a nose dive where i might do a complete bag dump. but that was rare.\n\nAlso, due to the rounded edges, the big pocket zipper sometimes doesnt quite close all the way, and there's a small gap. but i just have to tug just a bit more to get it closed right.\n\nBut for $39 (was actually $29 with some helpful discount codes during the holidays), cant complain too much.\n\nI feel like i went on waaaay too much on a bag that only has 2 pockets, but other than that, this is my new travel dopp kit!\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe gravel explorer line really impressed me. on paper, and in pictures, have to admit, not so impressive. but in hand, wow, totally different experience.\n\nbut the mini is the truth. easy to use, packs great, materials feel solid and terrific. what more do i need?\n\nwell, maybe the matador, as i could totally see myself using it as well, not only standalone, but also as an addition to the explorer mini to hold my shower scrub towel, since it packs so flat and small.\n\nas for the peak designs wash pouch small, just a wonderful little thing to behold. just wish its unique oddness worked for me. heck, i just may get the larger one for those long tours, where i'll need everything in my bathroom cabinet. the materials are wonderful, and the design is top notch. on those longer trips, normally, i take a roller, and i'm sure i can find room for it.\n\nCongrats to you for making it to the end!",

            "body": "**INTRO**\n\nI had been searching for something smaller to replace my Aer Dopp Kit 2. Its a terrific piece of kit, but its size makes me want to carry more than I need. and packed into my bag, it takes up a considerable portion of space. So, went on a holiday sale tear and took a look at several dopp kits of various shapes and sizes.\n\n**Review Criteria:**\n\n* smaller, flatter shape: wanna be able to pack it easily into my Aer Travel Pack 2, namely the front pocket to keep it away from anything else in case of spillage.\n* design: if i'm paying more for a ziplock bag, i'd want some thoughtful materials and org\n* easy to clean: i'm a messy person, but love a clean bag\n* accessibility: how easy is it to get to my ish\n* fun factor: as a manybagger, that's why we here!\n\n1-5 pts each criteria for a possible total of 25 pts.\n\n**Toiletries:**\n\n1. matador soap case (hair/body bar)\n2. matador flatpak (face wash)\n3. matador flatpak (hair conditioner)\n4. quip floss kit\n5. humangear stax (face lotion)\n6. humangear stax (clay pomade)\n7. tooth brush\n8. mini toothpaste\n9. 7” comb\n10. mini deodorant\n\nI'll go in the order I received and tried them. Mind you, I've only traveled a few times since with one or two of them, so not alot of time with them, but I did try to \"live\" out of them for a few days in my bathroom to get a feel.\n\nI actually ended up with a surprising pic!\n\n**Peak Designs Wash Pouch Small**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 1\n* design: 4\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 4\n\nTotal: 15 pts\n\nI wanted to really like this pouch. First glance, its a gorgeous little dopp kit. Best looking of the bunch by a long shot with its sage green outer shell and herringbone like interior liner.\n\nAnd it was markedly smaller than the aer.

So, went on a holiday sale tear and took a look at several dopp kits of various shapes and sizes.\n\n**Review Criteria:**\n\n* smaller, flatter shape: wanna be able to pack it easily into my Aer Travel Pack 2, namely the front pocket to keep it away from anything else in case of spillage.\n* design: if i'm paying more for a ziplock bag, i'd want some thoughtful materials and org\n* easy to clean: i'm a messy person, but love a clean bag\n* accessibility: how easy is it to get to my ish\n* fun factor: as a manybagger, that's why we here!\n\n1-5 pts each criteria for a possible total of 25 pts.\n\n**Toiletries:**\n\n1. matador soap case (hair/body bar)\n2. matador flatpak (face wash)\n3. matador flatpak (hair conditioner)\n4. quip floss kit\n5. humangear stax (face lotion)\n6. humangear stax (clay pomade)\n7. tooth brush\n8. mini toothpaste\n9. 7” comb\n10. mini deodorant\n\nI'll go in the order I received and tried them. Mind you, I've only traveled a few times since with one or two of them, so not alot of time with them, but I did try to \"live\" out of them for a few days in my bathroom to get a feel.\n\nI actually ended up with a surprising pic!\n\n**Peak Designs Wash Pouch Small**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 1\n* design: 4\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 4\n\nTotal: 15 pts\n\nI wanted to really like this pouch. First glance, its a gorgeous little dopp kit. Best looking of the bunch by a long shot with its sage green outer shell and herringbone like interior liner.\n\nAnd it was markedly smaller than the aer. Really loved the materials and funky shape. super unique and fun to use. lots of pockets, and loved how i could clean it so easily with the pull out tabs. and most of all, i liked the smaller footprint on my counter. the metal hook is a terrific touch.\n\nbut the materials really stood out to me. wonderful handfeel! made me want a larger backpack! was definitely the fanciest and nicest bag of the bunch.\n\nunfortunately, while the shape was fun to hold and look at, it was kinda awkward to use. the criss cross pockets looked cool, and i liked how it held the bag together while open. but each pocket didnt really feel as useful: smaller ones too small, big ones not big enough? and maybe it needed breaking in, but it wouldnt quite open as i'd like, nor sit on the counter stable.\n\nbut the real kicker was the odd shape, which made it pack not much better than my dopp 2. sure, its smaller, but when fully loaded, the bulgy odd triangular tube shape took up room in my bag in such a way that it didnt let the other items in my bag sit together as neatly. and did NOT pass front pocket test. i could wedge it in there, but it was pretty ugly.\n\n**Matador Flatpak Case (The non-zippered one.)**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 5\n* accessibility: 4\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 19 pts\n\nI purchased this after really loving their smaller flatpaks that i regularly use for travel. When i got it, was surprised at how big it was. and yet, given that its a rolltop, it can scrunch down pretty small.\n\nEasily fit all my tolietries, but not only that the big open top made it really easy to get to everything. and the material allowed light to shine thru, so i could see everything quickly and easily. Its just a big ol' bag made of super high tech materials.\n\nbest of all, i got this due to the dry-through tech. I travel with a scrub towel, and love how the membrane was able to dry thru it!\n\nThe flatter design was great too for packing into my bag no matter how much i dumped into it. and its the lightest weight of the bunch.\n\nbut after a while, the detailed organizer in me would have liked some pockets to keep things nicely separated. and would have been nice to separate the wash cloth from other items and not gunk up the other items while it dried inside.\n\nalso, while it takes up little space on a tight sink, and stands up ok, it does tend to slump over when full. i had stuff spill out all over my bathroom floor a few times using it. and i do like the loop, but a hook would have been much preferred.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Slim**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 2\n* accessibility: 5\n* fun factor: 2\n\nTotal: 17 pts\n\nAnother bag i really wanted to love. had a super flat shape. and loved all the pockets! so many cool places to put various things. and i liked the loop / hook design which made it really easy to hang.\n\nThe materials were MUCH nicer in hand. in pictures and videos, just looks like any other plastic'y nylon material. but in hand, feels much more luxe and soft and doesnt chaff. i really like it. and best of all, when packed, it fit super nicely in the front pocket of my aer travel pack 2.\n\nbut ultimately for me, each pocket was just a little too tight. and while the materials were easy to clean, the various tight pockets made it actually hard to clean. and due to the open face design, its made to be hanging from your towel rack. and it takes up alot of counterspace, especially when folded out.\n\n**Gravel Explorer Mini**\n\n* smaller, flatter: 5\n* design: 3\n* easy to clean: 4\n* accessibility: 3\n* fun factor: 5\n\nTotal: 20 pts\n\nI thought I was going to hate this little guy. Seems kinda fat, and its just two pockets. why bother? and yet, every review i read or heard kept on touting how great it was, so i reluctantly purchased it. but over time using it, i realized, this might be the one!\n\nAs like the explorer slim, love the materials. solid, robust, and luxe. in hand, just felt great and much better than expected.\n\nReally like the rubberized handles and zipper pulls, and the loop makes it easy to hang and place in any cramped space. Nevermind, helpful to pull from my pack. a rubber loop seems innocuous, but really made the bag fun to use.\n\nIts not much bigger than a large pencil case and sure, just two simple pockets. but that's all i really needed. fit all my toiletries with a packed but comfy fit. only once, did i have to do a full bag dump. the zippers open up rather wide to help you really dig into it.\n\noverall, as definitely smallest of the lot, it could fit anywhere in my travel pack without taking up too much space. the rectangular shape lent itself to any packing tetris, as it felt half the size of my old aer dopp kit 2. And it soft materials lends itself to a real smush if need be.\n\nbest of all, its only a touch thicker than the explorer slim, and whaddya know, fit the front pocket ok! if the main compartment is packed, it is pretty tight, but it can work.\n\nAnd since its just two pockets, made it really easy to clean and wash after the week's \"trip\".\n\nMy own issues are the black interior. would be nice to have something hi-vis ish. And if its really packed, accessibility does take a nose dive where i might do a complete bag dump. but that was rare.\n\nAlso, due to the rounded edges, the big pocket zipper sometimes doesnt quite close all the way, and there's a small gap. but i just have to tug just a bit more to get it closed right.\n\nBut for $39 (was actually $29 with some helpful discount codes during the holidays), cant complain too much.\n\nI feel like i went on waaaay too much on a bag that only has 2 pockets, but other than that, this is my new travel dopp kit!\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe gravel explorer line really impressed me. on paper, and in pictures, have to admit, not so impressive. but in hand, wow, totally different experience.\n\nbut the mini is the truth. easy to use, packs great, materials feel solid and terrific. what more do i need?\n\nwell, maybe the matador, as i could totally see myself using it as well, not only standalone, but also as an addition to the explorer mini to hold my shower scrub towel, since it packs so flat and small.\n\nas for the peak designs wash pouch small, just a wonderful little thing to behold. just wish its unique oddness worked for me. heck, i just may get the larger one for those long tours, where i'll need everything in my bathroom cabinet. the materials are wonderful, and the design is top notch. on those longer trips, normally, i take a roller, and i'm sure i can find room for it.\n\nCongrats to you for making it to the end!",
