Hope this helps anyone looking for an affordable sling.\n\nTook a photo of it next to the toshi sling to compare.",

A big seller for me is that you can take off the strip with no dangle and use it as a large tech pouch that doesn't look out of place. The strip can be placed in that bottom strip holder area, too. The strip does not dig into your back much when wearing it front side with a backpack in back. Fits an ipad mini. I will probably use this for flights on city trips and the rei on trips to tropical vacations or outdoors.",

        "selftext": "While searching for a simple larger sling for front carry on flights, I found this. At the moment, it's on sale for 39 us dollars on the rei site. Not much reviews of it online. Hit a lot of the marks I was looking for. No crazy branding, simple black, 5 to 10L, comfy enough,  back passport pocket, can carry ipad mini. Kind of stealth. Bith sides unclip to make it a pouch with carry handle. Foam backing for sweat and structure. Cons: not the best fabric compared to what people are use to on this reddit but it's decent and will hold up for casual use. REI is a decent brand for warranty. Not as water resistant as others. Not the best looker but not the worst. Not a fan of hip style but it works as a large hip if need and is comfy enough.\n\nI am happy with it and don't have to baby it cause it was affordable. Hope this helps anyone looking for an affordable sling.\n\nTook a photo of it next to the toshi sling to compare.",

        "selftext": "I originally got this bag as a first gen in 2014. Kept it until 2020, then I had some issues with the back lining wearing weird so I contacted them and sent it in. They gave me a brand new second gen bag. It was great for the most part, but I had some issues with the drawstring and the handle strap. Sent it in and it was fixed without any issues. 2 weeks total. Their warranty service is top notch from my experience.\n\nAside from all that... I really like this bag. I guess the biggest thing for me is the opening top part (I know there's a nerd term for it.. the brain?). I've used it countless times to fit things that were more than 26L. It's nice to have the option to have it open up and pop whatever the fuck it is you're carrying out the top.\n\nI also don't really mind the minimalism to DSPTCH stuff. Two major things that I would love though are a key ring and a hidden pocket. Otherwise I'm good with just stuffing shit in and/or using cubes/packs.\n\nI've attached some pics of a normal load out I'm doing for my usual trip back home to see my family.\n\nThere's still some room for sandwiches and whatnot...\n\n\n\n",

It is also pretty heavy due to the handles, which do absolutely nothing, and the pack is uncomfortable under any sort of \"heavy\" load. The backpack straps are thin and have no padding. The look is nice of it's fully packed out, but otherwise it gets super floppy and flaccid. But then if it's packed out, it gets uncomfortable to carry. \n\nAnother thing that was annoying was the side access zipper only to get to the main compartment. And some models have the buckles covering the zipper, so it's even more annoying to get into. \n\nI ended up going for something else entirely after using it for a month or so. I figured that the utility of a bag is more important and went for a CPL 24 and haven't looked back. I realized what was important for me in a pack and I realized I like clamshell opening and durable materiels with structure to the pack. Just my 2 ¢",

            "body": "I have two Witzman backpacks and have used them for all travel for the past five years.  They are comfortable to carry. well built, seem pretty durable (no visible damage after 30+ trips with each bag). They are both convertible (backpack or shoulder bag), have a main compartment for clothes, with laptop sleeve/pocket and multiple outside pockets. It is comfortable to wear for extended walks (thick padded straps with sternum strap) and I usually have them pretty full.  I do 2-3 days of travel and when possible, I prefer not to check in a bag.\n\n* The denim model is very light and has a more casual appearance. I would have preferred it without the synthetic leather, but to their credit, the fake leather has held up.  [https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/travel-backpack-carry-on-luggage-backpack?\\_pos=2&amp;\\_fid=f0dc19b7b&amp;\\_ss=c](https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/travel-backpack-carry-on-luggage-backpack?_pos=2&amp;_fid=f0dc19b7b&amp;_ss=c)\n* For work travel I purchased the nylon version because it looks a little more professional.  It is a sturdy bag and just 1/2 lbs heavier than the denim version.  A non-issue for most airlines, but some of the discount airlines weigh your hand luggage too... so be aware. [https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/carry-on-travel-backpack-nylon-bag?\\_pos=5&amp;\\_fid=25e23816a&amp;\\_ss=c](https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/carry-on-travel-backpack-nylon-bag?_pos=5&amp;_fid=25e23816a&amp;_ss=c) \n\nFor the build quality and durability, I think they are well worth their &lt; $100 price.  Just searching for top travel backpacks, the prices seem to be in the $250-$350 range.      \n  \nHope this helps.",

            "body": "I was as well and got one of these bags. They are terrible quality. Calling the interior lining paper thin would be giving too much credit. It is also pretty heavy due to the handles, which do absolutely nothing, and the pack is uncomfortable under any sort of \"heavy\" load. The backpack straps are thin and have no padding. The look is nice of it's fully packed out, but otherwise it gets super floppy and flaccid. But then if it's packed out, it gets uncomfortable to carry. \n\nAnother thing that was annoying was the side access zipper only to get to the main compartment. And some models have the buckles covering the zipper, so it's even more annoying to get into. \n\nI ended up going for something else entirely after using it for a month or so. I figured that the utility of a bag is more important and went for a CPL 24 and haven't looked back. I realized what was important for me in a pack and I realized I like clamshell opening and durable materiels with structure to the pack. Just my 2 ¢",

They are comfortable to carry. well built, seem pretty durable (no visible damage after 30+ trips with each bag). They are both convertible (backpack or shoulder bag), have a main compartment for clothes, with laptop sleeve/pocket and multiple outside pockets. It is comfortable to wear for extended walks (thick padded straps with sternum strap) and I usually have them pretty full.  I do 2-3 days of travel and when possible, I prefer not to check in a bag.\n\n* The denim model is very light and has a more casual appearance. I would have preferred it without the synthetic leather, but to their credit, the fake leather has held up.  [https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/travel-backpack-carry-on-luggage-backpack?\\_pos=2&amp;\\_fid=f0dc19b7b&amp;\\_ss=c](https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/travel-backpack-carry-on-luggage-backpack?_pos=2&amp;_fid=f0dc19b7b&amp;_ss=c)\n* For work travel I purchased the nylon version because it looks a little more professional.  It is a sturdy bag and just 1/2 lbs heavier than the denim version.  A non-issue for most airlines, but some of the discount airlines weigh your hand luggage too... so be aware. [https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/carry-on-travel-backpack-nylon-bag?\\_pos=5&amp;\\_fid=25e23816a&amp;\\_ss=c](https://www.witzman.com/collections/travel-backpacks/products/carry-on-travel-backpack-nylon-bag?_pos=5&amp;_fid=25e23816a&amp;_ss=c) \n\nFor the build quality and durability, I think they are well worth their &lt; $100 price.  Just searching for top travel backpacks, the prices seem to be in the $250-$350 range.      \n  \nHope this helps.",

                "body": "So I finally got my AC Daily Plus along with the DSPTCH strap and was able to mount the strap and test it. It's the C (Daypack) length.\nAs you can see from the pics below, it fits well over both my luggage handles - and most importantly over the wider one where other of my bags did not fit over.\nI have yet to test the comfort of wearing the packed out bag with the strap attached, but mostly plan on removing it once I have arrived at destination and use the bag for a day pack. This brings me to the only downside I have already identified - the two clips at either end of the strap are a real PITA to open, and especially to then remove from the backpack once attached. I hope they break in and get easier to open with time.\nThe backpack itself seems great so far (cordura version) and the hidden pocket at the top of the back panel is perfect for stowing the DSPTCH strap when not in use.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/sunvu57",

        "selftext": "This is my second DSPTCH Daypack. This time in Dyneema.\n\nI got my first Daypack at the DSPTCH store on Valencia in SF after much, much research. It stayed with me for almost 10 years, four continents, and literally hundreds of flights.\n\nI should be clear- my original one is still in my closet and still in fantastic shape. I just started getting itchy, wondering what else was out there. I went for a $600 Tumi gamer bag (seemed the techiest they offered) and it lasted about 6 months before I got frustrated with its limited capacity and awkward compartments. After that- and much time in this sub- I went with a Sympl Designs bag that seemed close to this DSPTCH but was very uncomfortable. I have very many other complaints about that backpack but I’ll save them because the DSPTCH Daypack is the focus here.\n\nI loved my original DSPTCH so much I decided to upgrade to the premium model. It weighs like no pounds and is built like a tank but otherwise identical to its predecessor- with the exception that the shoulder straps- minimal in their cushion but nonetheless all-day worthy- are even more dialed in and I have not had to readjust the length once.\n\nIt’s perfect. Stylish, comfortable exactly the right amount of compartments (the top mesh bag is perfect for my AirPods, charging cable, and random things I need quick access to). I adore this bag so much and I just wanted to tell you all. ",

        "selftext": "I bought the Gregory Tetrad 40 and used it once when I returned from Santa Fe to Seattle. Here are my initial impressions. Hopefully this will be helpful to anyone who is considering it. Overall I'm happy with it. The best thing is the suspension system and the worst is the laptop/tech compartment. This bag is reasonable alternative to the Osprey Farpoint 40.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Front view](https://preview.redd.it/9f6dnxg35ij31.jpg?width=2885&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=528773fd3a12ba0c7cacc202ca7526caa68048f7)\n\n**About me and why I bought this one**\n\nI'm new to one bag travel. Most of the time I travel I do short carries from my house to the airport via train or cab and then when I arrive getting to the rental car facility. I don't need much - I could lug a 20lb 40 liter duffel bag if I had to and that wouldn't be too bad. Or a rolling carry-on with small day pack. But when I visited New York several months ago I spent a lot of time hauling a bag several blocks to the subway, descending the steps, getting to my train and transferring to other trains, navigating through the train station, taking shuttles at the airport, etc. and I want this process to be easier next time. It would be a breeze going hands-free with a backpack. Maybe someday I'll do a lot of extensive traveling - hopping from one city to another via train - and I wanted to buy a bag I could use for this purpose. Also, I recently became intrigued by the idea of travelling with less and hope it might make travelling more enjoyable.\n\nI purchased a backpack from DSPTCH based on reviews from Chase Reeves and was very excited when it arrived. I loved the color, indestructible ballistic nylon, the design, beefy zippers, etc. When I loaded it up the total weight was around 21lb and it was uncomfortable to carry around the block - I started to feel strain in my neck and shoulders. I'm a strong and athletic 5' 9\" guy. The main problem was that the bag did not have a decent weight-bearing hip belt. For a true minimalist the answer is to just take a lot less, in which case you don’t need a hip belt. But I thought I did a good job paring down my stuff and had trouble getting the total weight, including 15\" laptop, below around 20lb. I loaded up the AER Travel Pack and although the hip belt helped, the torso size was wrong and the bag pulled me backward (they removed load lifters). So I decided that a key criteria for me in choosing a bag was that it fit properly and have some of the features you'd find in a backpacking backpack - torso adjustment, load lifters, weight-bearing hip belt, breathable back-panel, and good shoulder straps. This ruled out a huge number of exciting bags. I tried the REI Ruckpack 40 and though it was comfortable, it is really a top-loader and I found it awkward to work with. I tried the Farpoint 40 at REI and even with help from the people there could not get the sternum strap in the right place - it felt like it was choking me. That pack does not have an adjustable torso and comes in exactly 2 sizes. Peak Designs was a pretty good fit despite not having a lot of adjustment. For 95% of my usage scenarios, the Peak Designs probably would have worked better than the Gregory. But I worried a bit about the weight, cost, didn't like the buckles, and thought the back panel might not have enough ventilation. Didn't have a chance to see the Eagle Creek or Tortuga.\n\nI chose the Gregory Tetrad 40 because it had a solid suspension system, adjustable torso, about 40 liters of space, clamshell opening, space for a laptop, and a reasonable price - $180.\n\n**Suspension**\n\nThe suspension system is very nice. I quickly walked about 1/2 mile through Seattle streets on a hot day with no fatigue or sweating. My back did not get very hot. The pack plus contents weighed about 18 pounds. I did not bring a laptop so it is possible that if I had an extra 5 pounds on the front of the pack it might feel awkward. I used the hip belt, load lifters, and sternum strap. You can adjust the torso to your specific body size by sliding the shoulder straps up or down; they are attached with Velcro. There is a small wire metal frame around the back that helps the pack keep its shape and distribute the weight to the hips. The back seems to have good padding and is breathable. I was able to get it adjusted nearly perfectly for my body at REI.\n\n[Back and straps](https://i.redd.it/ye7ol15gthj31.jpg)\n\n[Adjustable torso, Velcro](https://i.redd.it/f69o4mvhthj31.jpg)\n\n[Wire frame at top of shoulder straps](https://i.redd.it/mzaqr2vtuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Decent fit, close to body (raised it an inch after photo taken)](https://i.redd.it/bmp3lrxkthj31.jpg)\n\n**ActiveShield**\n\nThere is a permanently attached zipper-close bag inside the main body that is supposed to be used for dirty clothes and muddy boots. You can wipe it clean with a sponge. I tried to use it for shoes and dirty laundry and it worked fine to isolate these items. The problem is that it causes the base of the clamshell to be bumpy and then was not as satisfying to lay down my packing cubes. I felt the need to fill in the bumps with my jacket, belt, and other miscellaneous items. You can choose not to use it at all, in which case it smooshes down to the bottom.\n\n[Shield not used, mostly flat](https://i.redd.it/a9t7nreqthj31.jpg)\n\n[Shield open with stuff inside, not zipped up yet](https://i.redd.it/7s4mv14sthj31.jpg)\n\n**Laptop Storage**\n\nThe front of the pack has space for your laptop, tablet, clipboard, papers, magazines, Kindle, and other flat items. There is one big padded slot. I could fit a 15\" Surface Book 2 in there with some room to spare. It is padded on all sides. There is a smaller sleeve in front you could use for something else, but it is not padded on the front.\n\nThis is my biggest disappointment with the bag. For weight distribution it is best to have the laptop on the back. I also travel with a lot of flat items and I wish this section of the bag had more pockets and more structure. It just isn't satisfying to put my papers and other items in slots that are kind of wobbly. My computer or clipboard gives it some structure. I also wish the frontmost slot had padding so my Kindle (or Tablet) was protected if the bag got checked. The newer tech backpacks, like AER and Tortuga, do an awesome job with this. Most of the time I won't be checking the bag. And if it ever did get checked, I probably would have removed the tech items ahead of time to use during the flight or ride, so I don't anticipate this being a big deal. The FarPoint has a much nicer looking laptop area despite also being in the wrong place.\n\n[With 15\\\\\" Surface Book](https://i.redd.it/buefxemuthj31.jpg)\n\n[Before put anything in, kind of wobbly without structure](https://i.redd.it/vzvt978xthj31.jpg)\n\n**Cover**\n\nThe pack comes with a detached cover. They call it a 3-in-1 cover since it can protect against rain, provide security, and completely enclose the bag if it ever got checked or thrown in the bottom of a bus.\n\nThe cover is somewhat bulky and durable - it doesn't compress well. They ship the bag to you with the cover in the quick access pocket on the top of the bag but I'd never put it in that prime real estate.\n\nI believe the cover is very waterproof; there are taped seams on the inside.\n\nIt took a little while to figure out how to use the cover. One way to use it is to just cover the front of the bag, which provides rain and security protection, but leave the back straps exposed. You need to roll up the zippered flap and store it at the base of the cover so it isn't in the way. When my bag was stuffed pretty tight the cover still fit ok. I put the cover on like this before boarding the airplane. You definitely wouldn't want to try putting the pack inside the cover once you get to your seat and people are waiting behind you; that would probably take too much time. I wore it with the straps and once I got to my seat chucked it in the overhead bin upside down with straps facing up without zipping the cover closed. That worked fine. The flight attendant had to move it to another compartment and he had no problem using the single grab handle for that.\n\nAfter I got off the plane I zipped the whole thing closed, just to see how that worked. It creates a nice safely protected package (other than the front of the tech compartment). There is a single grab handle on top.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about the cover yet. I'll probably try to never use it unless there is massive rain, I'm deeply concerned about security, or someone forces me to check it or chuck it into the bottom of a bus. For the case of zipping away the straps, the Farpoint and REI Ruckpack is probably a simpler quicker solution that allows you to still access the contents of the pack.\n\n[Cover taken out of bag](https://i.redd.it/gj1qk5p1uhj31.jpg)\n\n[Cover on and not zipped up](https://i.redd.it/q7awx19buhj31.jpg)\n\n**Storage and quick access**\n\nThere are no water bottle slots. I put my water bottle in the large stash pocket on the front which is better for weight distribution anyway. I'm a little concerned the elastic material there will get stretched out - time will tell. The 1 liter fit ok but I'd feel better with a slightly narrower bottle that doesn't stretch out the pocket as much.\n\nI really like the quick access pocket on the top. It can hold a decent amount of stuff - glasses, small earphones, snack, pen, ticket, and phone.\n\nThe clamshell experience was pretty good. It doesn't open 100% but close enough. I tried loading all my things into the Farpoint 40 and the bags are very similar size. I didn't like the bumpy bottom caused by the ActiveShield. The lid of the clamshell has a zippered mesh pocket; you can't see the contents inside that well. It is easy to partially unzip the clamshell to get bigger items out of the top of it, like your 3-1-1 liquid kit.\n\nThere is a mesh zippered security pocket at the top of the clamshell. I didn't use it.\n\nOnce the compression straps are locked down the zippers are stuck and you can't get to the bottom of the pack, though you can still access items at the top. I don't think you can get into the tech pocket without loosening the compression straps.\n\n[Clamshell open, not fully packed out with my stuff](https://i.redd.it/1epr5bvfuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Top of clamshell lid, can't see through mesh that easily](https://i.redd.it/zzjvv31iuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Security pocket](https://i.redd.it/1cq7m8oluhj31.jpg)\n\n[Quick access at top, fits plenty of things](https://i.redd.it/xpdacx1nuhj31.jpg)\n\n[Stash pocket](https://i.redd.it/hdgds4ipuhj31.jpg)\n\n**Materials and miscellaneous**\n\nThe pack seems well made and with durable materials. The zippers are YKK though the main compartment zipper is not as beefy as I'd like and not as big as Farpoint. I'm hoping Gregory knows what they are doing here and that they won't break down. I like the plastic buckles - they are easy to work with.\n\nThere are lots of dangly straps and no keepers to stop that from happening.\n\nWhen fully packed out (without water bottle in stash pocket) the pack is 21\" long, 14\" wide, and about 9\" deep.\n\nMy biggest complaint has more to do with one-bag travel than this pack. I like having certain conveniences with me on the plane, and transferring those items from the backpack to a structureless packable day pack just before takeoff is a hassle. Transferring those items back into the backpack after I arrive is also a hassle. Functionally it is nicer to have my clothes (and other stuff I will not touch in transit) in a duffel and all my office and tech stuff (laptop, papers, magazines, pens, Kindle) and snacks and 3-1-1 kit in a small high quality day pack that I can use in transit under my seat and once I get there. The Osprey Duplex seemed like a promising idea but I wasn't able to try it out.",

I had a customer a week ago come in and together we decided the tetrad was the best bag with a decent suspension that we carried in store. Nice to hear some real world reviews. I’m a Gregory fan myself for the fact that they like their gadgets and features. I’d never buy a Gregory - I do the smaller 25-35L onebag/ Ultralight thing - but I do appreciate what they offer the general public. Good stuff and I appreciated the pictures for reference.",

The Gregory has totally adjustable torso size while the FarPoint comes in just two sizes - men’s and women’s. I assume if you’re “average” height either one will fit decently. If you’re mostly doing short walks to the hotel or something it probably doesn’t matter. I thought the tech pockets on the FarPoint seemed much nicer and appeared to have more attention to detail even though on both packs the laptop is in the wrong place. They both hold about the same. The Tetrad has a center stash pocket, which I like, and don’t think it has size water bottle holders. They have a different cover mechanism. The FarPoint is easy to zip up the straps at the last minute while the Gregory is a little more involved and can cover the entire pack and function just as a rain cover.",
