        "selftext": "I'll try to be brief in hopes to get as much help as possible. About 10-12 times a year I travel for just 2 nights. I've never really put much thought into it before but have recently become intrigued by the thought of one bag travel. Two of the weekend trips are more outdoors but the bag remains in a cabin for the most part. The others are buisness travel (planes and hotels). I'm attempting a one bag travel system. (Is this really possible without the reg travel bag or the ctb35?..part of me thinks im wasting my time with 26 and 28L but thats for a different time maybe)\n\nTrying to decide between two great bags.\n\nCtb26 layout is great especially when coupled with a few cap1 and 2s. I'd rather have my cables and tech organized in something I can throw on a nightstand than in an admin panel. I find there is just a smart way to pack everything I need in the ctb26 without things floating or feeling out of place. It also seems bigger than the travel pack 3 small despite on paper the tp3s having 2 extra liters.\n\nThe straps on the travel pack are significantly more comfortable. When I activate the load lifters ever when fully packed the bag disappears. I love the padded handle on the tp3s and the center side carry handle.\n\nI own the evergoods cap set in xpac /coyote which I love but not sure about the bag in xpac. I'm worried about how it will wear. I significantly prefer the heavy Cordura.\n\nOver all Evergoods layout and color scheme with the coyote interior are very attractive but the straps and comfort on the travel pack are great.\n\nThe perfect bag for me would be a CTB26 in the TP3S cordura! (Should I hold for an Oct launch?)\n\nAny short or long term users of both with purchasing advice? ",

The CTB will fit marginally more than the Synik, though not as well organized, so I’m assuming it’ll be fine for longer term travel.\n\nYour choices are, to you: a more comfortable bag to wear or an easier bag to pack and use. This seems like an easy choice if you know what kind of travel you’ll be doing. To me I’d assume you’d prefer the CTB since it doesn’t sound like you’ll be doing a ton of walking around. There is no right and wrong, keep whichever you enjoy more on your trips and sell the other.",

I have only used the ultra bag on one trip so far, but it does seem a little easier to clean than x-pac. The weight difference will likely not be noticeable when packed out.\n\nOne thing to note is the hardware (side compression strap buckles) are slightly different on the ultra version and the interior is grey with some lime green on the ultra version. In my experience, the orange makes it easier to find things if accessing the bag in a dark room, on a plane, or at night. Also, I believe the top pocket of the x-pac version is fleece lined vs more of a ripstop fabric in the ultra version if that makes a difference.\n\nIn terms of durability, both will probably be fine as they are both solid materials, but I haven't had each bag very long. I did notice wrinkles and creases in the ultra bag were easier to see due to the shinier surface of the fabric.",

I have only used the ultra bag on one trip so far, but it does seem a little easier to clean than x-pac. The weight difference will likely not be noticeable when packed out.\n\nOne thing to note is the hardware (side compression strap buckles) are slightly different on the ultra version and the interior is grey with some lime green on the ultra version. In my experience, the orange makes it easier to find things if accessing the bag in a dark room, on a plane, or at night. Also, I believe the top pocket of the x-pac version is fleece lined vs more of a ripstop fabric in the ultra version if that makes a difference.\n\nIn terms of durability, both will probably be fine as they are both solid materials, but I haven't had each bag very long. I did notice wrinkles and creases in the ultra bag were easier to see due to the shinier surface of the fabric.",

It can stand on its own when properly packed as seen on the photos [[1]](https://i.imgur.com/q9I9i9a.jpg) [[2]](https://i.imgur.com/WdtgFAd.jpg)\n\n2. I can strap an M size jacket from Old Navy with no problem. Haven't had it snap open the fidlock yet\n\n3. The padding helps with the comfort and doesn't make the bag feel as heavy as it should be. The carry handles are very comfortable as well.\n\n4. Able to fit iunder the economy seat of a Korean Air 777-300ER  (77W) [[1]](https://i.imgur.com/2pkn4xP.jpg)\n\nGiven another chance, I would probably choose the ULA dragonfly over this, adjusting my packing habits as i would not need all the extra organization and reduce my overall load. Still pretty happy about the purchase.\n\nUpdate: Fits under the seat on a domestic PAL Airbus 320-200 with subjectively more leg room than on my international flight probably because of the IFE box.

A lot of the organization is also designed with EDC in mind, pockets for pens, notebooks, cables, and devices, not optimized for travel. Lastly, the weight of the bag for its size is just ridiculous, even in x-pac. \n\nSome less practical, and more personal knit-picks were that the bag is too rigid and structured, the buckled compression straps compressed quite minimally because the bag itself has such thick padding and material, the zippers were loud and jangly.\n\nAll-in-all, I think the pack is a solidly sleek EDC bag. Tons of organization for what I would carry going to the office everyday, or on a work trip.

I'm a gadget guy so I don't mind a zillion pockets etc.  It's the feasibility of compressing that thing down to (say) 5.5-6 inches depth (which is what it appears in that pic) that's my big question\n\nWhen you say \"compresses pretty ok\" -- how representative do you think the picture is?",

            "body": "I've been looking for the perfect pack for me.   I've got a bunch of requirements, of which one of them is expandability.  I discovered by using a different pack that most days I can make due with an 18-22L pack, and want it to be nice and low profile.  Sometimes, I need closer to 26-30L pack.  The thing is, I don't want two packs for this: I figured out that basically, I still want everything I carry everyday in the 18-22L, and just want to add more stuff to it.  For example, if I'm going to a hotel for the night, I still want everything in my usual pack, plus throw in toiletries, pajamas, clothes for next day -- very ponderous to have to move my regular EDC back and forth between packs.\n\nSo of course, I started looking at the expandables, and then ruled them all out one by one for various reasons.   Then I saw the picture above, and realized maybe I'd been thinking about this the wrong way... maybe instead of a zip-open expandable pack, I could get a 26-30L pack with great compression straps, and just compress it down on lighter days.   Which is why the picture above is so intriguing.   This pack hits EVERY ONE of my other requirements.  Plus the compression straps don't block the zippers, which is one major annoyance removed.\n\nSo the question, for anyone who has this pack: do the compression straps really work as well as the above picture seems to show?  Have any of you with this pack compressed it down, and it stays as low-profile as that pic?  Do you (or would you) use the pack compressed?\n\nThanks for any help!",
