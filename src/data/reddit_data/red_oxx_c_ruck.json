The Grey backpack is about 2 weeks old, the green messenger/notebook bag is about 6 months, and the teal bags are roughly 20 years and 100s of 1000s of miles old. The teal bags have seen 4 continents, 3 hemispheres, been slung out of the back of my truck at interstate speeds, handled by all kinds of airport employees and on countless hinting and camping trips. If I remember tomorrow I will edit with a picture of my \"tool\" bag. Which is their toiletry bag. This bag was underground with me in a hard rock mine, in the backend oilfield, and currently with me at a smelter. The railroad workers use it so much they have a line dedicated to it.  I cannot speak highly enough of their stuff, and their company/customer service. All hand made in Montana!",

        "selftext": "I received my atlas pioneer v4 in the mail today and there doesn't seem to be much info online about it yet, so I wanted to talk about my initial thoughts and see if anyone else had any insight! \n\nPhotos are 17 discs in main compartment (obviously plenty of room left over), orange disc is a zone, and two putters in the putter pocket. I've seen people say they can fit 4 in the v3, but I feel my usual 2 fit well. The bag showed up flat, and the side supports were very bent out of shape. I left it out with no discs in it for a few hours and it already started seeming to straighten up. I now have discs in the bag and it seems to be a lot better than when I got it. \n\nIt says online that the bags come with an extra support for the putter pouch. I did receive a rectangular support piece that fits in the pouch, but I have no clue what it's supposed to be doing and have sent an email asking someone to explain it so maybe I can get some benefit out of it. If you have one and know, please enlighten me! \n\nThe two rails on the bottom seem to work about as well as anything else I've used and I'm sure the bag will have no issues staying upright. Also like the 2 big water bottle holders and the huge side pockets on the side, but the small pocket in front of the putter pouch isn't super valuable to me. For reference my s23 ultra barely fits and requires shoving it in pretty good (that's what she said). \n\nAnyone else tried one yet or plan on picking one up? I was very surprised at the lack of content about the bag considering who owns it.",

        "selftext": "I received my atlas pioneer v4 in the mail today and there doesn't seem to be much info online about it yet, so I wanted to talk about my initial thoughts and see if anyone else had any insight! \n\nPhotos are 17 discs in main compartment (obviously plenty of room left over), orange disc is a zone, and two putters in the putter pocket. I've seen people say they can fit 4 in the v3, but I feel my usual 2 fit well. The bag showed up flat, and the side supports were very bent out of shape. I left it out with no discs in it for a few hours and it already started seeming to straighten up. I now have discs in the bag and it seems to be a lot better than when I got it. \n\nIt says online that the bags come with an extra support for the putter pouch. I did receive a rectangular support piece that fits in the pouch, but I have no clue what it's supposed to be doing and have sent an email asking someone to explain it so maybe I can get some benefit out of it. If you have one and know, please enlighten me! \n\nThe two rails on the bottom seem to work about as well as anything else I've used and I'm sure the bag will have no issues staying upright. Also like the 2 big water bottle holders and the huge side pockets on the side, but the small pocket in front of the putter pouch isn't super valuable to me. For reference my s23 ultra barely fits and requires shoving it in pretty good (that's what she said). \n\nAnyone else tried one yet or plan on picking one up? I was very surprised at the lack of content about the bag considering who owns it.",

I did some research, saw that the side pockets can fit a 48oz Nalgene and was sold. These bags are expensive BUT they’re worth it. I’ve went on 4 trips since buying this bag and have zero regrets. This bag carries more than any carry-on I’ve ever owned and yet because it’s a backpack that doesn’t look too big, airlines never give me any trouble with it. \n\nThe build quality is incredible. I have no doubt in my mind that it’s buy it for life quality. \n\nBefore investing the money into this pack, I struggled finding any information/reviews of it online. So, if you’re curious/interested in this pack, ask away! I’m happy to answer questions about my ownership experience.\n\n",
