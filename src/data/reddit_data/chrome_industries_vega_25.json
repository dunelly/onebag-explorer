The USSR states didn't trade with the West frequently, they really only traded a tiny bit with the US for some grain (to feed animals, and produce meat to imitate western lifestyles) and Japan a bit. Maybe it's best English was the language of science, and for scientists in the USSR they participated in the international scientific community?",

Prior to Stalin (who had a huge boner for watches) wrist watches were fundamentally luxury items in Russia, and there weren't really any domestic manufacturers, he basically ordered a watch industry to be created over night. And it was actually very successful as wrist watches quickly became common across Russia \n\nPoint being however that these aren't Omegas we're talking about. They were mass produced items, built to be hardy and lasting, but still mass produced factory made none the less, not expertly crafted precision instruments \n\nBasically I'm saying soviet watches should be viewed in terms of \"pound for pound\" quality. In which case as far as comparable mass produced cheap watches go they're still pretty damn good. \n\nI've never had any Podebas so I can't speak on them, but I've never seen anyone complain about their Vostoks before. The Vostok Amphibia is pretty renowned for its ruggedness and reliability. And the original Sturmanskie design, often called the Gagarin (for obvious reasons), was the first watch in space",

Intel used to publish them often but it seems like AMD publishes them once every couple of years.\n\nIt shows that the CPU manufacturers are aware of some of the bugs experienced by tech enthusiasts, but they never publicly acknowledge the bugs other than in these documents. I guess there is no way to fix these bugs without major silicon revisions, which they won't do because the lifespan of the products are usually so short.\n\nFor instance there is an Errata in this AMD document, errata 1157, that says that when the PCIE root port automatically changes to PCIE gen 4, link status is reported incorrectly. My guess, is that when automatic speed downshifing is allowed, like GPUs switching to PCIE 1.1 or 2 to save power, as they shift back to PCIE 4, the link status is not correctly exerted, causing problems.\n\nCould this be the problem on Ryzen with PCIE 4 and USB? It seems that one solution offered to fix the USB problems was to set the BIOS to PCIE gen 3....\n\nHmmmm. I LOVE these errata documents.\n\n\n\nBIG EDIT:\n\nAfter reading the entire document I noticed several other errata. Most seem to relate to the IO die as far as I can tell and PCIE specifically seems to be very problematic, along with USB and AHCI! This would seem explain the SATA problems on X570, along with the USB problems on Ryzen and X570 since the x570 is just a Ryzen IO Die on the motherboard.\n\nFor instance:\n\nPCIE erratas #:\n\n1165- Accumulate errors when PCIE Gen 3 with 1 or 4 lanes\n1166- Accumulate errors when PCIE Gen 4 with 2 lanes\n1171-PCIE Vendor Defined Messages dont work correctly\n1185-PCIE receive buffer errors\n1356-PCIE link may incorrectly train and drop to PCIE Gen 1\n\n1390- PCIE Hot plug problems\n\nUSB erratas #:\n\n1200- XHCI host may hang with full speed or high speed  hub!!!!!\n\n1294-XHCI host may drop data during isochronous transfer\n\nIOMMU erratas #:\n1216\n1277\n\nAHCI erratas#\n1305- Data device may train at lower link speeds\n\nSMBUS errata#\n\n1394- SMBUS collisions may not correctly read SPD from DIMM!!!!",

Maybe I'm naive but it felt like Google never tried to put some $$ behind awareness. The value props were there! What gives?\n\nEdit: wording",

Even when things clearly were not moving in the right direction we trusted so much the technology behind it that we believed Google would still give us a shot.\n\nThe release date was exciting but I think the biggest mistake was not calling it a Beta product and requiring a Controller and chromecast to play. Our user numbers were way below expectations and the amount of dumb post from the media outlets of people clearly misunderstanding Stadia and playing it on bad networks didn‚Äôt help.\n\nWhen I personally started worrying was in Feb 2021, when Stadia announced the closure of Stadia Games and Entertainment and ‚Äútransitioned‚Äù (aka laid off internally) several folks from businesses departments.\n\nThat was when we had a exec decision to keep the lights on but shift to a B2B model\n\nBut even with that shift it was still a surprise for everyone when they decided to shut it down.\n\n*Edit*: I wanted to highlight that many of the discussions are pinpointed on what went wrong. I wanted to share that I had a great experience on Stadia and am very fortunate to had been part of it. Everyone in the team had the understanding of how groundbreaking the tech was.

(For most of your issues) Most computers units use are woefully outdated, and for whatever reason those units refuse to purchase new hardware. My unit got new laptops relatively recently (year and a half or so) and they are fast. I think they have an I7, 32gb of ram, and an SSD for storage. My computer boots up, logs in, and finishes all its pop up crap in less than a minute. PDFs take no time to open, and I rarely run into issues with stuff being slow. \n\nThere are issues with the DoDIN, and AfNet too (things like MyFSS being garbage). But slow load times for things like login, pdf's, and even webpages is client side, not network side. You need better equipment but your unit doesn't want to spend the money. \n\n(I need to make a coverall copy paste bc I've said this like three times today, and there are more and more posts popping up about this)\n\nEdit: Larger bases probably go through the Base ECO for this process, smaller bases usually do what I said.",
