        "selftext": "Hi backpack redditors,\n\nI made this for backpacks and figured this would be a great place to get some feedback on it.  I call it Bakspacer.  It's a flexible accessory that attaches to most two strap adult sized backpacks designed to help just about anyone who wears a backpack and deals with sweat or sore shoulders/back.\n\nThe ribs look odd but are actually suprisingly comfortable because they direct the weight of the backpack to the meaty parts of your back, taking the pressure off your spine and reducing strain on your shoulders and lower back.  Been testing it for months and I'm trying to make this a real product, so would love to hear your thoughts.\n\nPicture of the product and some with and without test results from biking, same load, same distance, same day.  Used biking because it produces more sweat than walking.  You can check out [https://www.bakspacer.com/testing](https://www.bakspacer.com/testing) if you want more details of testing I've done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/561vcsg6qau31.jpg?width=5760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78e9bcb63679242bfb4e861626b815a1e4683bdd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6mi597iyqau31.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8af101a1802a091e0b98f4e43feee89dc4522e28\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dkta5jhjxu31.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c1490bc533255387f5e7814886d16f30c99d694\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxuce6kjjxu31.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bb6bb5502f81427a9219cd92b9bb89101397d17",

My question is how does it compare to packs that have built in breathability feats like how most bags have a suspended cavity / trampoline system. This seems like an issue that would more affect people who are into hiking and biking like you said but those people are also most likely to buy bags that already counter this kind of thing.\n\nAlso what is the sort of maximum sizes/dimensions of the product itself. Packs come in different shapes and sizes from torso length to width.\n\nWhat is the cost of this likely to be? And how much does he weigh?",

                "body": "Thanks for the thorough questions!  I like answering these.\n\n1. Most non-hiking bags for normal use that include \"airflow technology\" are just small channels cut out into the padding.  Or padding placed in specific places.  The problem is most of that padding is still pressed up against your body and the foam in the padding acts as a great insulator.  Bakspacer reduces the surface area contact dramatically.\n2. The channels/cavities of those bags also don't have access to the side airflow moving around a person.  This does.  If you look at the link below, it shows airflow analysis of a cyclist.  Bakspacer catches some of that fast moving air wrapping around the body from under the arms and channels it into the back.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWvdaPMLM4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyWvdaPMLM4)\n\n3) On larger packs with mesh/frame systems work great when you're standing up or walking but not as great when you're on a bike and are hunched over.  Your back presses through the mesh and closes the gap back there.  This maintains the gap whether standing or arched.\n\n4) Lots of people already have backpacks and buying purpose built bags is either too expensive or doesn't function for their other needs.  Example, I couldn't use my camera or hiking bag for work.  Combination of functionality to carry things and sometimes color/design.  Same reason panniers don't work for me when biking.  A good backpack serves a lot of purposes and once you find one, you don't have to stop using it.  Bakspacer just attaches to that bag.\n\n5) Price point I hope will be around $36 shipped if/when it goes to retail.  I have lower price points on my kickstarter right now, starting at $27 shipped for early bird.  So this is much less than getting a purpose built backpack and you can move it around to all the other backpacks you own if you are switching off.\n\nEdit \\*forgot to answer a question\\*\n\n6) It will fit backpacks around 14-18\" long from straps to bottom of the bag and 11-14\" wide from where the straps attach on the sides.  The final part should be just over a pound.  It was designed to work with most two strap bags I could come across at REI, dicks sporting goods, target, walmart, gander mountain, etc.\n\nMuch more information on the website, [bakspacer.com](https://bakspacer.com) and on the kickstarter page.",

Unfortunately, the 80mm 5v fan I had did not provide enough juice to move any through.\n\nIf my kickstarter funds, I do have a whole line of accessories to add onto bakspacer to personalize it, help it move more air, and even active cooling like described above.",

I don't have any merino wool clothing other than socks and forgot I had this.  Picked it up in Peru about 6 years ago.

Bag had about 20 lbs in it, mainly my bike locks and some camera gear.  Did stairs, slow walk, fast walk, bouncing walks, short jog, standing around, etc.  It did nothing to the sweater.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpMFxvT2twU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpMFxvT2twU)",

As long as it doesn't leave angry red welts on my back after use, then this seems like a winner idea.\n\nI like that it can be used on multiple backpacks. It would also be great for hot and humid weather like anywhere in South East Asia. That can be a market for you to think about later. If you're manufacturing in China, then it's even easier to ship or dropship from there to South East Asia.\n\nAnother attachment/design idea: if the backpack is turned sideways, can your product be used as a trolley strap? The suitcase handle would slip in between the bakspacer and the bag's back. Then you could pull it along that way.

They don't hurt and aren't raw, just skin indents like if you put a rubber band around your wrist and the line it leaves behind or wear glasses and the pads leave little indents on your nose.\n\nThe final version will be injection molded from a TPE type material with a rounded head so less to catch anything on.  Also, the finish will be smooth, unlike the prototypes that sometimes has small burrs on it from the 3d printing process.  I try to cut all of them off with clippers but tiny ones that I can't get are still present.\n\nBut even with the deficiencies of the prototypes, they work extremely well and are comfortable to use.  The ribs do a great job distributing weight and maintaining shape but are flexible enough to absorb small motions and deform completely if needed.\n\nI have thought about SE asia but trying to get traction here first.  Would definitely appreciate any support you can give to my kickstarter campaign.\n\nAnd bakspacer is a little too floppy to use as a luggage strap but I'll certainly see if I can make it work somehow!",
