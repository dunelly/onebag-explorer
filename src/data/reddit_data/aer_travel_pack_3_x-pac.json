            "body": "I recently purchased these items from AliExpress. I've never owned an AER product before but they certainly look and feel legit. I have closely inspected them and not found any obvious issues. The packaging was pretty basic, and there were no product string tags attached. I was able to save a lot of money not only because these are priced cheaper, but also shipping was just a couple dollars (arrived in 1 week). Plus, they put an even lower value on the customs declaration, so there was no Duty/VAT collected, which would have been \\~30% in my country if I had ordered the legit bag from AER. I really wanted the X-Pac version of the TravelPack 3, and it was considerably more costly than the standard version on AE, so I could have saved a lot more money just buying the standard bag.\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox. I won't be sharing any links here or by DM.\n\n**EDIT 2: July 2024 UPDATE** -- I've received many requests for an updated review. I have since used this bag for backpacking around Thailand and Indonesia - nearly two months of living exclusively out of this bag.\n\nPOSITIVE: It is extremely durable, there is not a single scratch or stain or pulled thread or busted zip. Everything is super strong, quite frankly far better than I'd expect from a \"knockoff\", I'd say it's gotta be at least as good as the legit version. The bag is super comfortable to carry both on my back or by one of the side handles. I also purchased the waist strap but ended up never using it as I never walked far enough where I felt I really needed it.\n\nNEGATIVES: Unfortunately, the X-Pac with the special zips were not enough to keep the inside of my bag dry after a three hour long speedboat trip with several meter high swells splashing into the boat. While the bag was not inundated with water, it did get heaps of spray and upon opening it, my clothes were all slightly damp. I had expected far better. Other negatives: I didn't need or use at least 50% of the features of this bag. I have no notebook or tablet, so the entire padded section in the back was of no use for me. Also the equally large front zip section which contains those pockets and slots for odds and ends was of no use to me either. I'd gladly trade those two unused sections for an expanded central container section. Lastly, this bag was just not large enough for all my stuff. I ended up carrying another small backpack everywhere as well and even that was full up. I brought 7 days of clothes + toiletries + snorkel+mask  + 3 cameras and a mini-drone. After all that, there was no room for even a spare pair of shoes.\n\nMy next bag will likely be appx 5 litres larger, non-xpac (waste of money imo), and will have fewer divisions. That said, this bag is still in perfect condition so I'll likely get a lot more miles out of it.",

            "body": "I recently purchased these items from AliExpress. I've never owned an AER product before but they certainly look and feel legit. I have closely inspected them and not found any obvious issues. The packaging was pretty basic, and there were no product string tags attached. I was able to save a lot of money not only because these are priced cheaper, but also shipping was just a couple dollars (arrived in 1 week). Plus, they put an even lower value on the customs declaration, so there was no Duty/VAT collected, which would have been \\~30% in my country if I had ordered the legit bag from AER. I really wanted the X-Pac version of the TravelPack 3, and it was considerably more costly than the standard version on AE, so I could have saved a lot more money just buying the standard bag.\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox. I won't be sharing any links here or by DM.\n\n**EDIT 2: July 2024 UPDATE** -- I've received many requests for an updated review. I have since used this bag for backpacking around Thailand and Indonesia - nearly two months of living exclusively out of this bag.\n\nPOSITIVE: It is extremely durable, there is not a single scratch or stain or pulled thread or busted zip. Everything is super strong, quite frankly far better than I'd expect from a \"knockoff\", I'd say it's gotta be at least as good as the legit version. The bag is super comfortable to carry both on my back or by one of the side handles. I also purchased the waist strap but ended up never using it as I never walked far enough where I felt I really needed it.\n\nNEGATIVES: Unfortunately, the X-Pac with the special zips were not enough to keep the inside of my bag dry after a three hour long speedboat trip with several meter high swells splashing into the boat. While the bag was not inundated with water, it did get heaps of spray and upon opening it, my clothes were all slightly damp. I had expected far better. Other negatives: I didn't need or use at least 50% of the features of this bag. I have no notebook or tablet, so the entire padded section in the back was of no use for me. Also the equally large front zip section which contains those pockets and slots for odds and ends was of no use to me either. I'd gladly trade those two unused sections for an expanded central container section. Lastly, this bag was just not large enough for all my stuff. I ended up carrying another small backpack everywhere as well and even that was full up. I brought 7 days of clothes + toiletries + snorkel+mask  + 3 cameras and a mini-drone. After all that, there was no room for even a spare pair of shoes.\n\nMy next bag will likely be appx 5 litres larger, non-xpac (waste of money imo), and will have fewer divisions. That said, this bag is still in perfect condition so I'll likely get a lot more miles out of it.",

            "body": "I recently purchased these items from AliExpress. I've never owned an AER product before but they certainly look and feel legit. I have closely inspected them and not found any obvious issues. The packaging was pretty basic, and there were no product string tags attached. I was able to save a lot of money not only because these are priced cheaper, but also shipping was just a couple dollars (arrived in 1 week). Plus, they put an even lower value on the customs declaration, so there was no Duty/VAT collected, which would have been \\~30% in my country if I had ordered the legit bag from AER. I really wanted the X-Pac version of the TravelPack 3, and it was considerably more costly than the standard version on AE, so I could have saved a lot more money just buying the standard bag.\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox. I won't be sharing any links here or by DM.\n\n**EDIT 2: July 2024 UPDATE** -- I've received many requests for an updated review. I have since used this bag for backpacking around Thailand and Indonesia - nearly two months of living exclusively out of this bag.\n\nPOSITIVE: It is extremely durable, there is not a single scratch or stain or pulled thread or busted zip. Everything is super strong, quite frankly far better than I'd expect from a \"knockoff\", I'd say it's gotta be at least as good as the legit version. The bag is super comfortable to carry both on my back or by one of the side handles. I also purchased the waist strap but ended up never using it as I never walked far enough where I felt I really needed it.\n\nNEGATIVES: Unfortunately, the X-Pac with the special zips were not enough to keep the inside of my bag dry after a three hour long speedboat trip with several meter high swells splashing into the boat. While the bag was not inundated with water, it did get heaps of spray and upon opening it, my clothes were all slightly damp. I had expected far better. Other negatives: I didn't need or use at least 50% of the features of this bag. I have no notebook or tablet, so the entire padded section in the back was of no use for me. Also the equally large front zip section which contains those pockets and slots for odds and ends was of no use to me either. I'd gladly trade those two unused sections for an expanded central container section. Lastly, this bag was just not large enough for all my stuff. I ended up carrying another small backpack everywhere as well and even that was full up. I brought 7 days of clothes + toiletries + snorkel+mask  + 3 cameras and a mini-drone. After all that, there was no room for even a spare pair of shoes.\n\nMy next bag will likely be appx 5 litres larger, non-xpac (waste of money imo), and will have fewer divisions. That said, this bag is still in perfect condition so I'll likely get a lot more miles out of it.",

            "body": "I recently purchased these items from AliExpress. I've never owned an AER product before but they certainly look and feel legit. I have closely inspected them and not found any obvious issues. The packaging was pretty basic, and there were no product string tags attached. I was able to save a lot of money not only because these are priced cheaper, but also shipping was just a couple dollars (arrived in 1 week). Plus, they put an even lower value on the customs declaration, so there was no Duty/VAT collected, which would have been \\~30% in my country if I had ordered the legit bag from AER. I really wanted the X-Pac version of the TravelPack 3, and it was considerably more costly than the standard version on AE, so I could have saved a lot more money just buying the standard bag.\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox. I won't be sharing any links here or by DM.\n\n**EDIT 2: July 2024 UPDATE** -- I've received many requests for an updated review. I have since used this bag for backpacking around Thailand and Indonesia - nearly two months of living exclusively out of this bag.\n\nPOSITIVE: It is extremely durable, there is not a single scratch or stain or pulled thread or busted zip. Everything is super strong, quite frankly far better than I'd expect from a \"knockoff\", I'd say it's gotta be at least as good as the legit version. The bag is super comfortable to carry both on my back or by one of the side handles. I also purchased the waist strap but ended up never using it as I never walked far enough where I felt I really needed it.\n\nNEGATIVES: Unfortunately, the X-Pac with the special zips were not enough to keep the inside of my bag dry after a three hour long speedboat trip with several meter high swells splashing into the boat. While the bag was not inundated with water, it did get heaps of spray and upon opening it, my clothes were all slightly damp. I had expected far better. Other negatives: I didn't need or use at least 50% of the features of this bag. I have no notebook or tablet, so the entire padded section in the back was of no use for me. Also the equally large front zip section which contains those pockets and slots for odds and ends was of no use to me either. I'd gladly trade those two unused sections for an expanded central container section. Lastly, this bag was just not large enough for all my stuff. I ended up carrying another small backpack everywhere as well and even that was full up. I brought 7 days of clothes + toiletries + snorkel+mask  + 3 cameras and a mini-drone. After all that, there was no room for even a spare pair of shoes.\n\nMy next bag will likely be appx 5 litres larger, non-xpac (waste of money imo), and will have fewer divisions. That said, this bag is still in perfect condition so I'll likely get a lot more miles out of it.",

While the bag was not inundated with water, it did get heaps of spray and upon opening it, my clothes were all slightly damp. I had expected far better. Other negatives: I didn't need or use at least 50% of the features of this bag. I have no notebook or tablet, so the entire padded section in the back was of no use for me. Also the equally large front zip section which contains those pockets and slots for odds and ends was of no use to me either. I'd gladly trade those two unused sections for an expanded central container section. Lastly, this bag was just not large enough for all my stuff. I ended up carrying another small backpack everywhere as well and even that was full up. I brought 7 days of clothes + toiletries + snorkel+mask  + 3 cameras and a mini-drone. After all that, there was no room for even a spare pair of shoes.\n\nMy next bag will likely be appx 5 litres larger, non-xpac (waste of money imo), and will have fewer divisions. That said, this bag is still in perfect condition so I'll likely get a lot more miles out of it.",

I have closely inspected them and not found any obvious issues. The packaging was pretty basic, and there were no product string tags attached. I was able to save a lot of money not only because these are priced cheaper, but also shipping was just a couple dollars (arrived in 1 week). Plus, they put an even lower value on the customs declaration, so there was no Duty/VAT collected, which would have been \\~30% in my country if I had ordered the legit bag from AER.

I was able to save a lot of money not only because these are priced cheaper, but also shipping was just a couple dollars (arrived in 1 week). Plus, they put an even lower value on the customs declaration, so there was no Duty/VAT collected, which would have been \\~30% in my country if I had ordered the legit bag from AER. I really wanted the X-Pac version of the TravelPack 3, and it was considerably more costly than the standard version on AE, so I could have saved a lot more money just buying the standard bag.\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox. I won't be sharing any links here or by DM.\n\n**EDIT 2: July 2024 UPDATE** -- I've received many requests for an updated review. I have since used this bag for backpacking around Thailand and Indonesia - nearly two months of living exclusively out of this bag.\n\nPOSITIVE: It is extremely durable, there is not a single scratch or stain or pulled thread or busted zip. Everything is super strong, quite frankly far better than I'd expect from a \"knockoff\", I'd say it's gotta be at least as good as the legit version. The bag is super comfortable to carry both on my back or by one of the side handles. I also purchased the waist strap but ended up never using it as I never walked far enough where I felt I really needed it.\n\nNEGATIVES: Unfortunately, the X-Pac with the special zips were not enough to keep the inside of my bag dry after a three hour long speedboat trip with several meter high swells splashing into the boat. While the bag was not inundated with water, it did get heaps of spray and upon opening it, my clothes were all slightly damp. I had expected far better. Other negatives: I didn't need or use at least 50% of the features of this bag. I have no notebook or tablet, so the entire padded section in the back was of no use for me. Also the equally large front zip section which contains those pockets and slots for odds and ends was of no use to me either. I'd gladly trade those two unused sections for an expanded central container section. Lastly, this bag was just not large enough for all my stuff. I ended up carrying another small backpack everywhere as well and even that was full up. I brought 7 days of clothes + toiletries + snorkel+mask  + 3 cameras and a mini-drone. After all that, there was no room for even a spare pair of shoes.\n\nMy next bag will likely be appx 5 litres larger, non-xpac (waste of money imo), and will have fewer divisions. That said, this bag is still in perfect condition so I'll likely get a lot more miles out of it.",

            "body": "I recently purchased these items from AliExpress. I've never owned an AER product before but they certainly look and feel legit. I have closely inspected them and not found any obvious issues. The packaging was pretty basic, and there were no product string tags attached. I was able to save a lot of money not only because these are priced cheaper, but also shipping was just a couple dollars (arrived in 1 week). Plus, they put an even lower value on the customs declaration, so there was no Duty/VAT collected, which would have been \\~30% in my country if I had ordered the legit bag from AER. I really wanted the X-Pac version of the TravelPack 3, and it was considerably more costly than the standard version on AE, so I could have saved a lot more money just buying the standard bag.\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox. I won't be sharing any links here or by DM.\n\n**EDIT 2: July 2024 UPDATE** -- I've received many requests for an updated review. I have since used this bag for backpacking around Thailand and Indonesia - nearly two months of living exclusively out of this bag.\n\nPOSITIVE: It is extremely durable, there is not a single scratch or stain or pulled thread or busted zip. Everything is super strong, quite frankly far better than I'd expect from a \"knockoff\", I'd say it's gotta be at least as good as the legit version. The bag is super comfortable to carry both on my back or by one of the side handles. I also purchased the waist strap but ended up never using it as I never walked far enough where I felt I really needed it.\n\nNEGATIVES: Unfortunately, the X-Pac with the special zips were not enough to keep the inside of my bag dry after a three hour long speedboat trip with several meter high swells splashing into the boat. While the bag was not inundated with water, it did get heaps of spray and upon opening it, my clothes were all slightly damp. I had expected far better. Other negatives: I didn't need or use at least 50% of the features of this bag. I have no notebook or tablet, so the entire padded section in the back was of no use for me. Also the equally large front zip section which contains those pockets and slots for odds and ends was of no use to me either. I'd gladly trade those two unused sections for an expanded central container section. Lastly, this bag was just not large enough for all my stuff. I ended up carrying another small backpack everywhere as well and even that was full up. I brought 7 days of clothes + toiletries + snorkel+mask  + 3 cameras and a mini-drone. After all that, there was no room for even a spare pair of shoes.\n\nMy next bag will likely be appx 5 litres larger, non-xpac (waste of money imo), and will have fewer divisions. That said, this bag is still in perfect condition so I'll likely get a lot more miles out of it.",

But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

With the 40 lite, I believe they removed their admin pocket and it’s all internal storage with maybe one zipper on the outside for a few items.

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

        "selftext": "\nHeading to Australia for 15 days in November and Singapore/Malaysia for 15 days in January. I packed more shirts than I probably need but I don’t plan on stopping for laundry until the end as I’ll be on the go. I’ll be sink/hand washing underwear, socks, shorts along the way and a few shirts if needed. \n \nLarge packing cube (14x10x4)\n- 11 shirts ( I’ll probably cut this down to 8)\n \nLarge packing cube\n- 3 shorts\n- 2 pants \n\nSmall packing cube (10x7x4)\n- 3 darn tough socks\n- 6 under armor underwear \n\nToiletry \n- toothbrush\n- toothpaste\n- loofa\n- razor\n- 90ml shampoo \n- 90ml body wash\n- lotion \n- hand sanitizer\n- packable towel \n\n\nMisc\n- teva meacham\n- international charger \n- 5pk film \n\nChrome Kadet 9l\n- Olympus trip 35s\n- portable charger block\n- 2 charging cables + 1 box \n- AirPod \n- iPad Air \n- TNF packable rain jacket  \n\n\n\nTortuga 30l- 17.2 lbs\nSurprisingly, everything fit in the 30l, but it was a real tight fit. Could I get rid of some stuff to make this bag work? Sure, and I still might as I’m still considering this bag. But I’m not trying to compromise what I need to take for the sake of taking a smaller bag. I would also prefer a little extra space for anything I may want to bring back. For those able to keep their needs low, I recommend this bag. \n\nPros: smaller bag if that’s what you’re looking for. I really like the clamshell opening with the huge mesh pocket. That pretty much fit my small packing cube and fitting and toiletry bag. The facts that it fit everything I needed was impressive. I also like the hidden side and top pocket as it’s got some good volume. \n\nCon: not a lot of cons besides the tech pocket that has too many small pockets. It has credit card pockets which seem a bit out of date. I would have preferred larger pockets like the AER. \n\n\nAER TP3 Xpac - 16.4 lbs \nThis is the initial bag I wanted but needed to be sure. While this is ultimately the bag I chose, I’m not entirely in love with it though. \n\nPros: this thing is absolutely built like a tank, material feels pretty damn tough, my favorite designs of all the bags. It’s the lightest of all 3 while fitting the sweet spot between too small and too big. I walked around fully loaded for about an hour and felt great. Compression straps seemed great but they’re not as effective as I’d like. There’s also quite a bit of pull on the zipper where it’s located, which may eventually tear after some time. \n\nCons: tech pockets will probably be useless for me. Besides a iPad and a MacBook Air on rare occasions, all the tech I need I fit in my chrome kadet sling. When the main compartment is fully loaded, you really can’t fit much in that pocket either, making it kind of pointless, though this may be a problem as you can get rid of a tech pouch and use that pocket instead. I would have preferred more volume on the inside like the mesh pocket on the tortuga. The waterbottle pocket is also useless if the entire pocket is fully 2 loaded. I used a student discount for the Tortuga, so this ended up being the most expensive bag (not really a con)\n\nTortuga 40l - 17.8 lbs \nIt’s crazy how this bag is barely a few inches bigger and fits another 10L. It’s obviously the biggest of the 3, though the AER IS almost similar in size. I fit everything in the main compartment and still have room for another small packing cube at the top. It’s the heaviest bag which is the reason I didn’t choose it. This is a great 40l bag and recommend it for anyone looking for this size bag.",

Worked great and packed up nicely on the way there.   \n\nWhile visiting my parents, I added 8 boxes of girl scout cookies, another 8 Magic Treehouse books, and a handful of Christmas ornaments, and it STILL carried well, and most importantly fit in the Lufthansa overhead without any questions, measuring or weighing. \n\nReally happy with how much this can fit.",

For Frontier, in the picture above I think it is for the smaller Personal article. Your TP3 (35L) would likely have to go in the overhead bin. As it would be too big for under seat.

        "selftext": "Let me tell you about this absolute beast of a travel bag - the AER Travel Pack 3 X-Pac. So after falling in love with my AER Day Pack, I wanted something that could double as a daily EDC &amp; Travel Bag. So I landed on the Travel Pack 3. I went with X-Pac as I wanted the weather resistance and the orange interior.\n\nFirst up, I tried using it as my daily carry and at 35L, it's definitely overkill for just hauling around your laptop and lunch. Found myself walking around with a half-empty bag that still looked like I was headed to the airport. Lesson learned - this isn't really meant to be your everyday sidekick.\n\nBut man, when it comes to actual travel? This is where this bad boy really shines. It's found its true calling as my go-to travel companion, and it absolutely crushes it in that role.\n\nThe X-Pac material is like giving your bag a superhero cape - water bounces right off it, and it's tough as nails while being lighter than the regular version. Plus, it's got this sweet technical look with a subtle X pattern that makes it stand out.\n\nThe organization game is on point. Pop this thing open like a suitcase, and bam - everything's right there where you need it. No more diving headfirst into your bag looking for that one t-shirt.

I went with X-Pac as I wanted the weather resistance and the orange interior.\n\nFirst up, I tried using it as my daily carry and at 35L, it's definitely overkill for just hauling around your laptop and lunch. Found myself walking around with a half-empty bag that still looked like I was headed to the airport. Lesson learned - this isn't really meant to be your everyday sidekick.\n\nBut man, when it comes to actual travel? This is where this bad boy really shines. It's found its true calling as my go-to travel companion, and it absolutely crushes it in that role.\n\nThe X-Pac material is like giving your bag a superhero cape - water bounces right off it, and it's tough as nails while being lighter than the regular version. Plus, it's got this sweet technical look with a subtle X pattern that makes it stand out.\n\nThe organization game is on point. Pop this thing open like a suitcase, and bam - everything's right there where you need it. No more diving headfirst into your bag looking for that one t-shirt.

            "body": "I've been looking for the perfect pack for me.   I've got a bunch of requirements, of which one of them is expandability.  I discovered by using a different pack that most days I can make due with an 18-22L pack, and want it to be nice and low profile.  Sometimes, I need closer to 26-30L pack.  The thing is, I don't want two packs for this: I figured out that basically, I still want everything I carry everyday in the 18-22L, and just want to add more stuff to it.  For example, if I'm going to a hotel for the night, I still want everything in my usual pack, plus throw in toiletries, pajamas, clothes for next day -- very ponderous to have to move my regular EDC back and forth between packs.\n\nSo of course, I started looking at the expandables, and then ruled them all out one by one for various reasons.   Then I saw the picture above, and realized maybe I'd been thinking about this the wrong way... maybe instead of a zip-open expandable pack, I could get a 26-30L pack with great compression straps, and just compress it down on lighter days.   Which is why the picture above is so intriguing.   This pack hits EVERY ONE of my other requirements.  Plus the compression straps don't block the zippers, which is one major annoyance removed.\n\nSo the question, for anyone who has this pack: do the compression straps really work as well as the above picture seems to show?  Have any of you with this pack compressed it down, and it stays as low-profile as that pic?  Do you (or would you) use the pack compressed?\n\nThanks for any help!",

It can stand on its own when properly packed as seen on the photos [[1]](https://i.imgur.com/q9I9i9a.jpg) [[2]](https://i.imgur.com/WdtgFAd.jpg)\n\n2. I can strap an M size jacket from Old Navy with no problem. Haven't had it snap open the fidlock yet\n\n3. The padding helps with the comfort and doesn't make the bag feel as heavy as it should be. The carry handles are very comfortable as well.\n\n4. Able to fit iunder the economy seat of a Korean Air 777-300ER  (77W) [[1]](https://i.imgur.com/2pkn4xP.jpg)\n\nGiven another chance, I would probably choose the ULA dragonfly over this, adjusting my packing habits as i would not need all the extra organization and reduce my overall load. Still pretty happy about the purchase.\n\nUpdate: Fits under the seat on a domestic PAL Airbus 320-200 with subjectively more leg room than on my international flight probably because of the IFE box.

A lot of the organization is also designed with EDC in mind, pockets for pens, notebooks, cables, and devices, not optimized for travel. Lastly, the weight of the bag for its size is just ridiculous, even in x-pac. \n\nSome less practical, and more personal knit-picks were that the bag is too rigid and structured, the buckled compression straps compressed quite minimally because the bag itself has such thick padding and material, the zippers were loud and jangly.\n\nAll-in-all, I think the pack is a solidly sleek EDC bag. Tons of organization for what I would carry going to the office everyday, or on a work trip.

But the middle zipper on yours looks pretty straight…  Can you post more pics, especially when the bag is full?",

I obviously disagree. I'm going to return the X-Pac and keep the cordura model. Overall I'm a little bummed out just because it's not perfect, but I am very happy with the bag that I am keeping.",
