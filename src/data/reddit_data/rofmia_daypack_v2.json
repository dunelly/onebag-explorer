If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If people travel with this, it makes it a pain to access when they’re on the go. I’m also worried that a lid might come loose and eff my laptop up LOL. \n\nPerhaps I missed it in your text, but how’s the strap comfort with heavy loads over long periods of time?",

Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped.

Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2.

If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If people travel with this, it makes it a pain to access when they’re on the go. I’m also worried that a lid might come loose and eff my laptop up LOL. \n\nPerhaps I missed it in your text, but how’s the strap comfort with heavy loads over long periods of time?",

Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped.

Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods.

If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If you put your zipper in the middle of the bag you're limiting the modularity of packing. It's not really deep enough to stack things on either side of the clamshell and have them stay. The bag doesn't really have much depth until it's half closed and then it's hard to organize. Even the 26 would feel like a lot less usable space for me than a ruck 21 or something similar.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

If people travel with this, it makes it a pain to access when they’re on the go. I’m also worried that a lid might come loose and eff my laptop up LOL. \n\nPerhaps I missed it in your text, but how’s the strap comfort with heavy loads over long periods of time?",

Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

            "body": "**FOREWORD** \n\nRight off the bat I have to admit that I am partial to Black Ember products. They’re a small innovative team based in San-Francisco that has been pushing the boundaries of what everyday carry (EDC) can be for urban dwellers and beyond. I was fortunate enough to review the WaterProofRollTop (WPRT article) as well as the TechKitSling (TKS article) which both left me impressed and very intrigued to see what else Black Ember would release in the future.\n\nEnter The Shadow (comes in 22L and 26L), their latest backpack that was, once again, funded using Kickstarter (raising almost 30000% of its original goal) and currently on preorder at their website ([https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks](https://blackember.com/pages/best-everyday-backpacks) ). \n\nBlack Ember was kind enough to provide me with the 26L version of the bag, which was tested over the course of 8 weeks. This mainly as an EDC in an urban environment, basically as a mobile office.\n\nDoes the Shadow 26 live up to expectations? How is it different from previous Black Ember offerings (such as the similarly sized R2 with 25L capacity)? And most importantly, should you consider the Shadow for your EDC?\n\nRead on to find out.\n\n**WHO IT SUITS**\n\n* Minimalists seeking a simple and practical backpack.\n* Anyone looking for a waterproof bag and who values the peace of mind of having the contents dry no matter the weather.\n* Those who want a durable, long-lasting bag backed by a lifetime warranty.\n\n**WHO IT DOESN’T**\n\n* Black Ember’s design and aesthetics might not work for everyone.\n* If you need dedicated access to your laptop you might not enjoy the need to get into the main compartment to get your gear.\n* Unlike previous Black Ember offerings, the Shadow is not modular so if you want a customizable bag or hope to reuse existing mods and accessories the Shadow might disappoint.\n\n**ABOUT THE BAG**\n\n\\* PRICE: $229 ( Pre-order price $183)\n\n\\* DIMENSIONS: 19 x 12 x 7.5 in (483x305x191)\n\n\\* WEIGHT: 1.1 kg (22L) and 1.4 kg (26L)\n\n\\* CAPACITY: 22L and 26L\n\nAs all Black Ember products, the Shadow 26 came in a stylish black, reusable soft bag secured by drawstring. Upon taking the bag out, it immediately and unmistakably felt like a Black Ember product. Featuring the same sleek, clean silhouette and offering one of the best water resistances in the industry, thanks to the innovative fabrics and bonding process used.\n\nUnlike previous BE backpacks (WPRT, R2, Forge) which in some way or another were modular (even the minimal versions offered a degree of customization thanks to the rich ecosystem of accessories designed in-house) the Shadow is essentially “what you see is what you get”. Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section.

The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped.

Despite it being a departure from the previous direction, many will welcome this change. After all, modularity means that to fully spec out the bag you need to invest considerably in the ecosystem of accessories and mods. With the Shadow however you get the bag and you are set.\n\nIt makes sense to compare the Shadow 26 to the R2. They have similar capacity (26 vs 25L), full clamshell opening, a nearly identical harness system and both occupy the niche of EDC bags. Unlike the R2 however the Shadow 26 has a few key differences:\n\n* The front pocket has much more dimension and is therefore way more usable compared to the flat pocket on the R2.\n* No modularity, as mentioned before. \n* The top and side grab handles are permanently attached.\n* The shape of the bag is more streamlined with rounded corners and easier on the eye compared to the more ‘boxy’ look of the R2.\n* The fabric and structure of the bag are very different. The fabric is much softer which also means that the bag can look very different empty and full. This in stark contrast to the R2 which looks the same regardless of the load, thanks to the built-in structure of the bag.\n* Laptop access is strictly from the main compartment, unlike the dedicated laptop compartment accessed from the top of the R2.\n* The Shadow has built-in organizations very similar to the TKS.\n\nThese differences are quite substantial and make the Shadow a very interesting addition to the product line and not necessarily a replacement for any existing bag in Black Ember’s portfolio.",

                "body": "**COMFORT**\n\nAs with all Black Ember bags comfort is excellent and the harness system is nearly identical to the R2 and Forge. Nicely padded, contoured shoulder straps in combination with a dense, yet soft, back panel make carrying this bag a very pleasant experience regardless of the load.\n\nI am sure Black Ember has tried countless iterations of the harness before choosing this one and based on my experience using multiple Black Ember bags, I can say they nailed the comfort.\n\n**DESIGN &amp; FEATURES**\n\nMinimal. Clean. Streamlined. These words come to mind when looking at and using the Shadow. Deep black color with matching YKK Aquaguard zippers and subtly branded hypalon zipper pulls all come together nicely. There is nothing flashy about it, but I can’t possibly call the Shadow a boring product. It revels in its stealthy technical identity.\n\nThere are many little things Black Ember incorporated in the Shadow which made using the bag a joy. Some of the noteworthy features include:\n\n* Internal organization of the front pocket, including a magnetic red key clip.\n* Internal organization of the main compartment with light grey mesh for a beautiful silver interior, which is also great for visibility!\n* 2 side handles.\n* Full clamshell opening for extreme access and packing convenience. \n* The bonding process, the fabric and the YKK AquaGuard zippers make the Shadow essentially impregnable for the elements. \n\nOverall, despite the design being clearly minimal, the pack feels polished and complete with just enough features to be useful without getting complicated.\n\n**MATERIALS &amp; ORGANIZATION**\n\nBlack Ember is well known for having some materials wizards and the Shadow 26 does not disappoint with a new innovative fabric called HTX. The main material is a three layer high tenacity fabric that offers supreme durability and waterproofing. Soft to the touch and less structured compared to the R2, it no longer has a “rubbery” feeling and also allows the pack to be compressed well when empty. This was certainly not the case with the R2.\n\nThe hardware is brilliant across the board. The custom-made aluminum hardware and YKK Aquaguard zippers complement the stealthy, technical look of the pack extremely well.  \n\nThe inner liner is also great and a joy to use, the matte silver 200d ripstop is durable and offers wonderful visibility in the main compartment.\n\nSubtle branding, laser etched on the hypalon zipper pulls, is very appreciated and goes well with the ninja aesthetic of the Shadow. The attention to detail and commitment to making the Shadow the best EDC bag one could ask for really paid off here.\n\nThe organization is just right. The front pocket on the R2 was too flat to be truly useful (it reminded me of Goruck’s front pockets in that regard) but in the Shadow the pocket finally has some dimension and, more importantly, subtle yet efficient organization with an included magnetic key clip. Conveniently there is a cable passthrough that goes from the main compartment to the front pocket, allowing you to charge your device with a powerbank placed in the main compartment.\n\nThe main compartment has everything one could possibly need: a fleece lined and suspended laptop sleeve, tablet sleeve, mesh zippered and open pockets with some healthy dimension and of course the TKS-style accordion organizer secured with a WooJin Magic Catcher (South Korean alternative to Fidlock buckle). I loved everything about the built-in organization apart from the accordion section, which added some bulk. It can also feel too rigid when in use. This is specific to me as I tend to rotate many bags and have a few org pouches with my essentials that I simply transition from one bag to another. This means that I don’t need the sophisticated organization offered by the Shadow’s accordion section. I did try to use it though and ultimately preferred other solutions to organize the little things I carry. Your mileage may vary and will depend on how you currently organize your EDC. The Shadow 26 would be perfect for those who have zero pouches/organizers, so they can fully utilize the built-in organization offered by the bag.\n\n**WHAT’S HOT**\n\n* Excellent build and materials\n* Extremely weatherproof (claimed to be waterproof)\n* Very comfortable, as expected from a Black Ember bag\n* Thoughtful built-in organization \n* Fair and reasonable pricing considering the overall quality and lifetime warranty\n* Comes in 2 sizes to accommodate different needs and body types\n\n**WHAT’S NOT**\n\n* Not compatible with existing Black Ember mods and accessories.\n* Can look floppy when not full.\n* TKS-like internal organization adds bulk and is not as convenient to use as I hoped. Some will find it a godsend, others (like myself) nearly useless due to other solutions in place.\n* No external access to your laptop (unlike previous BE bags), forcing you to get into the main compartment whenever you need it.\n\n**VERDICT**\n\nThe Shadow 26 is a cool pack. It is unmistakably a Black Ember product with the brand’s DNA (blacked out, waterproof, minimal, sleek) all over it. At the same time, it shows a clear departure from the modularity and structure seen in previous products, which for some people could be a huge benefit (no need to invest in a sophisticated ecosystem of mods and accessories to reveal the pack’s full potential) and for others a significant drawback (especially for those who have already heavily invested in the BE ecosystem, which is not compatible with the Shadow).\n\nPersonally I enjoyed using the bag and, based on my experience with other Black Ember products, I can clearly see that the Shadow fits well in the existing BE line-up. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you are looking for a supremely comfortable, slick and minimal EDC bag, the Shadow should be on top of your list. Just be aware that if you use existing organization solutions some of the cool built-in organization of the Shadow might become useless and will still be a permanent part of the bag.",

Thanks for the detailed words about it.\n\nI agree with another commenter about placing the zipper in the middle of the compartment and limiting depth within the pouch.\n\nI do really like the zipper security though, that’s a really nice touch. \n\nFor some reason, the water bottle pouch on the inside makes me feel uncomfortable. If people travel with this, it makes it a pain to access when they’re on the go. I’m also worried that a lid might come loose and eff my laptop up LOL. \n\nPerhaps I missed it in your text, but how’s the strap comfort with heavy loads over long periods of time?",

You will need to change full sets of soaking wet clothes frequently.\n\n\n Congrats for  procreating and have fun and stay relaxed and get enough sleep..",

I’m trying to front load sleep these next few months because we’ve been told that’s going to be one of the hardest things to battle through. \n\nAs for the Quechua, I agreeit is pretty sleek and it seems to be hitting all the right points and for a super reasonable price. As you already called out having no black option might be it’s only weakness outside of I’m not super sure how I would handle a roll top bag, but I’m sure it would just take some getting used to like anything else. \n\nAnother plus is the 10yr warranty. Can you speak to the quality of the bag overtime? At the price I’m curious how the materials are holding up over time. \n\nAgain, thanks for the rec and general baby tips!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/ine9n8/rofmia_backpack_v2_detailed_initial_impressions/",
        "selftext": "#Intro\n\nI recently purchased the rofmia Backpack v2 new and it arrived last week.  Because of COVID-19, I haven't been able to put it to good use traveling or wearing about, but wanted to provide some impressions now because info on the backpack is a bit scarce.  \n\nTo start let me be blunt:  this bag is expensive (~$800 with shipping), but to me it's worth the price - *it's one of the most premium feeling, well-designed bag I've handled*.  I'll try to be thorough in my impressions, but it's very hard for me to find any cons with the bag.  \n\n##[&gt;&gt; PICS &lt;&lt;](https://imgur.com/a/BX08otr)\n\n_(Pics also linked inline below in context.)_\n\n#Impressions\n\n#####Top Quick Access Pocket\n\n* Quick access pocket at top is a game changer.  It's small, but [perfectly fits my wallet attached by key strap](https://i.imgur.com/yafdR0u.jpg) (it has [a small hidden keyring](https://i.imgur.com/ZYV52Fh.jpg) that I can attach the strap to).\n\n* Quick access pocket is made of stretch fabric so it's accommodating in size.  [It does stretch/take a little space away from the main compartment of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/vM0B06l.jpg), but that isn't a big deal because top space isn't well used anyways. \n\n* The zipper is a folding zipper, and [there's a small webbing garage](https://i.imgur.com/OFkLeNV.jpg) so it's out of the way when closed. \n\n#####Laptop Side Pocket\n\n* Runs along back side of the bag and zips/unzips smoothly.  \n  - Much easier to use [than the one on my custom rofmia backpack v1](https://i.imgur.com/9F2t2N2.jpg), where the zipper would get caught on the compression snaps and be annoying to zip/unzip.  \n  - note [rolltop closure bottom button on v2 is attached via webbing loop now and stands stiffly away from the laptop zipper](https://i.imgur.com/mftO1DP.jpg), so it never gets in the way.\n\n* There's padding on both front/back of the laptop pocket, and it's suspended about 1cm off the ground.  Wish it was suspended a little bit more, but it's honestly fine.\n\n* [Easily fits my 13\" retina macbook pro with room to spare](https://i.imgur.com/MywGM9r.jpg).  I could see this fitting a 16\" macbook pro, or even thicker gaming laptops (though taller laptops [may interfere with the top quick access pocket when full](https://i.imgur.com/vM0B06l.jpg)).  The opening is [very generous and the laptop is very easy to slip in and out](https://i.imgur.com/37sX1eN.jpg).\n\n* [The zipper tucks neatly under a triangle-shaped garage at the top when zipped shut](https://i.imgur.com/CFTVajf.jpg). The zipper doesn't interfere with carry comfort at all.\n\n#####Water Bottle Pockets\n\n* The stretch fabric is dense and actually has some structure, and the top 1.5\" or so is reinforced with an additional layer of stretch fabric to keep it stable.  \n\n* The pockets seem deep and flexible enough to accommodate many different bottle sizes.  \n  - They fit [my rivers water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/dVOUXeQ.jpg), a [generic 18L stainless steel water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/UKDtcOL.jpg), and even [my 18L blender bottle](https://i.imgur.com/VYdTpPY.jpg) just fine.  \n  - Unfortunately I don't have bigger water bottles to test with, but I think it could fit a nalgene 1L water bottle okay - the 2.9oz dyneema on the sides is flexible and allows larger water bottles to expand inwards towards the bag as needed.\n  - EDIT:  [here’s a pic with two 1L water bottles](https://imgur.com/a/5rBlANX).\n\n* When not in use they're pretty inoffensive looking and lie pretty flat.  Again, water bottles seem to mould into the bag a little than jut outwards, helping keeping the bottle centered closer in the bag, and [keeping the bag more streamlined even with a larger water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/VYdTpPY.jpg).\n\n* Because the rolltop fidlock kinda juts outwards, it [helps trap the water bottle](https://i.imgur.com/N8xIEF7.jpg), so it's harder for it to fall out.\n\n#####Front Access Panel\n\n* It's amazing how much more sturdy the stretch fabric pocketing feels over the more crinkly nylon ripstop pocketing of the v1.\n\n* [Bottom pocket opening has been oriented diagonally](https://i.imgur.com/QfdVb3v.jpg) so it's easier to access when backpack is swung over the right shoulder.  \n  - There's a small pen loop which is really just a webbing loop.  \n  - The pocket opening makes it difficult to fit larger items (e.g. a notebook) in there because of the smaller opening, but smaller things like a portable charger + cables fits in easily and securely.  \n  - Pocket runs the width of the bag so it's sizable.\n\n* Internal zippered pocket has one of those \"lay-flat\" ykk zippers which is nice (no jiggle).  It's generously sized (runs width of the bag), and [seems like a great place to fit my passport and wallet or other small accessories](https://i.imgur.com/J9NFJxH.jpg).  \n\n* It's hard to see, but there's also a small webbing loop at the top.  I've found [it's the perfect place for me to put my outlier key piece](https://i.imgur.com/y9BQEE4.jpg) - that way, my keys are attached, but I can easily detach/reattach with minimal fiddling.\n\n* Like v1, [there's a zipper along the side that opens to get full access to the main compartment of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/sPYHFrk.jpg).  I think this is smart, as it allows [easy access to all contents of the bag](https://i.imgur.com/CbMfnuu.jpg) (even contents at the bottom) when swung off the right shoulder, while also protecting the contents from the elements [because it's protected behind two zippers and an outer flap covering](https://i.imgur.com/XjOtEOg.jpg).  \n\n* Small detail, pbut the front access pocket is actually gusseted so it can expand to fit more items](https://i.imgur.com/vfJKMfN.jpg).  I can see myself [putting the Tom Bihn medium cafe bag freudian slip there](https://i.imgur.com/Qfbj68N.jpg) for additional organization (it fits perfectly), or other accessorieslike a hat on top of the front panel organization.\n\n#####Top Rolltop Access\n\n* Revised fidlock system works very well in practice.  \n  - It doesn't allow half-turns like the old buckle system; however, I always rolled it down in full turns anyways, and [the easy detatch and magnetically guided attach makes the tradeoff worthwhile for me](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d088a3_171e7538bf394f91b64b65aeb2a4ee4e~mv2.gif).\n  - With buckles, re-attaching is a two-handed practice requiring attention:  you have to find the buckle, then attach it.  But with the fidlocks, it's one-handed:  the attachment point is stiff so all you have to do is get close and the magnets guide it securely into place - so much easier.\n  - The lack of dangling and distracting compression straps [makes attaching the rolltop fidlocks simpler and more straightforward](https://i.imgur.com/mftO1DP.jpg).  \n\n* [Internal compression system removes any dangling compression straps](https://i.imgur.com/X7hXCh3.jpg).  \n  - Despite looking easy to adjust/loosen (it's just held in place by thin nylon webbing), it takes some work as the buckle's slots hold the straps securely in place; you have to pull the webbing through the buckle slot manually to get it to adjust.  \n  - As I don't expect to adjust the rolltop compression frequently, I like that it isn't easy to adjust, as I'd prefer to have it not loosen unexpectedly when I'm walking about.\n\n* The fidlocks [snap to two buttons on the top of the rolltop when fully undone](https://i.imgur.com/RBSjJAS.jpg).  This was actually a lot nicer than I thought - just very nice and satisfying to have the large buckles out of the way/not dangling/rattling when trying to get something in/out of the main compartment.\n\n#####Main Compartment\n\n* Massive bucket:  [can easily fit a tom bihn tristar medium packing cube](https://i.imgur.com/PhYz5tB.jpg) (I think a large aeronaut 45 packing cube would fit in here too), with room on the top to spare for items like a toiletries kit, jacket, etc.  Because the DCF is whitish on the inside, things are actually pretty visible. \n\n* When rolltop is closed, everything still accessible via side zip (as already mentioned).\n\n* Side stretch fabric water bottle pockets [actually provide some structure to the sides so doesn't collapse inwards](https://i.imgur.com/PRIJN4V.jpg) when accessing the main compartment.\n\n* Laptop pocket is separated from main compartment by a 3/8\" eva foam padding (though [it is open at the top so it can be inserted top-access](https://i.imgur.com/PRIJN4V.jpg), but why would you do that)\n\n#####Shoulder Straps\n\n* [Very plush and pliable](https://i.imgur.com/H92kQBK.jpg), with [comfortable curved shape and edgeless design](https://i.imgur.com/OOunMxf.jpg).  \n  - Kinda like the tom bihn edgeless straps in that they both conform to the body, but with the backpack v2's 3/8\" padding being less plush than the tom bihn's 1/2\" straps (the tradeoff here is the rofmia straps have a lower profile and lighter weight because of the thinner padding).  \n  - They're a good length and width too.\n\n* The straps are a lot more comfortable than the daypack v2 when new.  \n  - I think it's because the 2.9oz on the backpack v2 straps is more pliable/flexible than the daypack v2's when new, so it better conforms to the body than the daypack's, which feel more rigid in comparison.\n\n* [Fidlock on sternum strap is makes attaching/reattaching trivially esay.](https://i.imgur.com/6SY91E7.jpg)\n  - I usually hate wearing sternum straps (even though it helps stabilize the bag with heavier loads) because attaching the buckles usually requires fiddling with both hands to find both sides and snapping them together -- just a tedious process to do quickly.\n  - With the fidlock it becomes a one handed operation:  [as one side stays in place (it's short)](https://i.imgur.com/xxvIQmD.jpg), it's easy to magnetically guide the other side to the buckle with one hand.  I find myself using the sternum straps more when I use ones with fidlocks.\n\n* Load-lifting straps do work well; [they help bring the top of the bag closer to the body, which helps keep the bag from tipping backwards and straining your shoulders](https://i.imgur.com/OKcXfj4.jpg).  Hidden benefit is that it increases the top strap width distance, which makes it more comfortable if you have a larger neck/wider frame.  \n  - Strap keepers make adjusting the load-lifters more difficult (more friction), but it's not that bad:  pull on the strap to tighten, lift up on the nifco plastic adjuster to loosen.  Can be done with one hand, but works better with two hands.\n\n* [Strap keepers](https://i.imgur.com/Og7yfY3.jpg) for the bottom straps helps keep dangling straps out of the way.  Not having dangling straps fluttering when you're bike riding or just generally walking around is nice.\n\n* Back panel is padded with a semi-rigid 1/2\" piece of EVA foam.  Although technically a \"hard flat plate against your back\", it works for me because it just rests comfortably above my waist (I'm 5'8\").\n\n#####Design Details and Construction\n\n* Zippers:\n  - Zippers are aquaguard, but [have a nice almost leathery texture to them](https://i.imgur.com/9vDAEsS.jpg) that feel more premium than most other ykk aquaguard zippers, which feel plasticky in comparison.\n  - Zippers for laptop compartment, front access, and main bag side internal access have [pulls that are small and slightly chiselled](https://i.imgur.com/pFyowzW.jpg), look premium, and are pretty quiet (don't jangle).\n  - Zippers for top quick access, front internal pocket, and rolltop top are [\"lay-flat\" kind that don't jiggle around and lay flat and low-profile](https://i.imgur.com/OFkLeNV.jpg).\n\n* Construction is immaculate.  \n  - Stitching is even, stitched multiple times for added durability at high-use areas.\n  - [All seams are finished](https://i.imgur.com/XjOtEOg.jpg) (although not taped, but that shouldn't be too big a problem since it's a rolltop)\n  - Stiffer/slightly more structured 5.0oz DCF is used on bottom, front, and back for durability\n  - More flexible 2.9oz DCF is used on rolltop, sides, and straps where added flexibility is desirable (sides benefit for compression and accommodating varying water bottle sizes)\n  - [Webbing used has a softer texture and matte look](https://i.imgur.com/TZMrTWP.jpg) than most other slippery nylon webbings on other bags\n\n##### Design Discussion and Size Comparison\n\n* The bag seems to have been meticulously designed to eliminate excess and distraction, which helps make using the bag feel more zen, focused, and easy to use..\n  - Zipper pulls are small to avoid excessive clanking/noise\n  - Compression straps have been eliminated [in favor of stretch interior compression, with no straps](https://i.imgur.com/IiL37bv.jpg).\n  - Rolltop compression straps [has been redesigned so all the \"adjustment\" is internal, with strap management to prevent dangling straps](https://i.imgur.com/X7hXCh3.jpg).\n  - All other straps have strap keepers to keep them out of the way.  \n  - All the zippers are smooth, fidlocks make attaching the rolltop closure/sternum strap easy one-handed gestures.  \n\n* [The tri-tone of subtly lighter-colored 5.0oz DCF, darker 2.9oz DCF, and matte black stretch fabric creates a sophisticated modern aesthetic](https://i.imgur.com/Ut9Trlz.jpg).  And without the compression straps it looks a lot cleaner than the backpack v1.\n\n* DCF rolltop design is excellent for rain protection since there's no top zipper for rain to seep through, yet contents are still easily accessible through the front side pocket.  Addition of laptop back access pocket is great convenience improvement over v1 - now you really can just keep the rolltop always closed, and access the laptop/other EDC items easily through the other access pockets.\n\n##### Size and Weight Comparisons\n\n* Size seems perfect for one-bag travel.  I think it's just small enough that it can maybe get away as a personal item, which was one of the big draws of the bag for me.  Compared to the 40L v1 I had before, it's just so slightly smaller and feels just right.  I don't think I would've used the 40L as a daypack, but I can definitely see this 35L (25L when rolltop is compressed) doing well as a daypack.  \n  - [Compared with Tom Bihn Aeronaut 30](https://i.imgur.com/XErj2w1.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Aer Travel Pack 2 X-Pac](https://i.imgur.com/d2QYtIT.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Tom Bihn Synapse 19](https://i.imgur.com/7AJmnrS.jpg)\n  - [Compared with Daypack v1](https://i.imgur.com/mt7X3ij.jpg) (sold rofmia daypack v2 and custom backpack v1, so no size comparison unfortunately)\n  - [Flattened (nothing inside)](https://i.imgur.com/M3HMrWc.jpg)\n  - [Moderately packed (rolltop not extended full)](https://i.imgur.com/OKcXfj4.jpg)\n\n* Much much lighter weight than other travel bags:  \n  - backpack v2 is 1.75lbs \n  - vs Aeronaut 30 (2.38lbs in halcyon)\n  - vs Aer Travel Pack 2 X-Pac (3.4lbs in x-pac)\n  - vs synik 22L (2.49lbs in halcyon)\n  - vs synik 30L (2.85lbs in halcyon)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nRofmia mentioned that over 15 prototype Backpacks were made before the final v2 form was created; that should speak to how thoroughly designed and well thought-out this v2 version is.  Effort was put into removing any distraction (excess straps, noisy zippers) and designing what's left to be simple and easy to use (fidlocks, smooth zippers).  \n\nEvery aspect of the design feels deliberate and premium, and it really is a joy to handle and use.  It's an expensive bag at $800, but I feel it's well worth it in craftmanship and design.  I hope I could communicate some of the great details of this bag in the bullets above.  \n\n**_Overall:_**  *I'm very glad I bought mine and highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium bag that can be used for both EDC and travel.  10/10.*\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading.  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to answer them.  I hope to write more follow-up impressions once I get to travel with it.\n\nCheers!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(EDIT:  realized I didn't put the product link, here it is:  https://en.rofmia.com/product-page/backpack-v2)\n\n^(EDIT:  added some photos with [two 32oz water bottles fitting in the side pockets](https://imgur.com/a/5rBlANX).)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n^(p.s. These impressions took me many hours over several days to take all the pictures and write up.  If you liked this, please consider upvoting!  )",

It is crinkly, picks up dirt, and is not durable. This material is used by many thruhikers for their tents/packs and this is pretty common feedback, but that trade-off is worth it for that use-case. My experience is with the Hyperlite Mountain Gear 3400 pack and a Zpacks tent both made from DCF.",

                "body": "AFAIK, the use of DCF in Rofmia's daypack and Boston bags is an inner laminate, but the outer material is a woven polyester (i.e., it is not just a single layer or dual layer Dyneema laminate as used by HMG or Zpacks).  I have Rofmia's Boston bag, and I haven't been able to find a lot of info, but it is very similar or the same material used in [this day pack](https://ghostly.com/products/ghostly-x-rpmfg-dyneema-backpack) (that I also own) which describes the material as \"2.92oz Hybrid Dyneema Composite Fabric\".  AFAIK that pack uses [this material](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/2-92-oz-dyneema-composite-fabric-hybrid-ct5k-18-wov-32c?variant=1007084765210).  I would believe it if Rofmia was using the same stuff.  So, the DCF in Rofmia's bags is more providing a lightweight waterproof backing, and the outer woven fabric adds abrasian resistance (and I think looks/feels quite nice).\n\nI'm interested to see if any cottage manufacturers try to make bags out of the \"Dyneema Black\" stuff that Vollebak used in [this thing](https://www.vollebak.com/product/indestructible-puffer/).  It's absolutely not ultralight, but it would be very strong.  I know woven Dyneema is used for ropes where strength is paramount.",

The Granville isn't terrible, but it's not a very comfortable carry under heavier loads either. \n\nThe Granville wins in terms of space usage. The two bags in the pictures have similar loads. Surprisingly, the Nomin feels pretty tightly packed whereas the Granville still has space in its front pocket. The Nomin's two pockets seem like a good size, but can't fit much in reality. \n\nOverall, both bags have their strengths and weaknesses. The Nomin has hands down the most comfortable straps I've ever used, but the space is very inefficient for its size. The Granville is smaller and fits a surprisingly amount, but its straps really let it down. \n\nWould be nice if they made something Granville sized but with the Nomin's straps. Anyone have any feedback from the Rofmia Daypack and if that fits the bill?",
