It was one of my first \"nice\" backpacks but I really can't recommend it at this point for several reasons. The first is the material, it feels nice and soft but it is such a pain to keep clean and it isnt durable at all compared to industry standards - it flexes and creases within a handful of wears. Second, it has a completely black interior which makes visibility rough. Third, its harness system is lacking compared to top of the line bags in its price category (no sternum strap or real back padding). Positives are I actually quite like the pocket layout and it has impressive capacity for its physical size (in part because the material is so stretchy).",

            "body": "My strap started fraying weeks upon receiving it.  I waited until the strap came apart, and then the warranty department said that straps coming off the bag are normal wear and tear and aren't covered under the warranty.\n\nI feel strongly that this was a legitimate manufacturing problem, so I tried to have them re-evaluate and also tried to escalate the case, so far with no success.  The current Surge backpack reviews indicate this is now a common experience.",
