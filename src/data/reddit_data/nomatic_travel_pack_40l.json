            "body": "My review of the Gravel Travel System.\n\nFull disclosure: I was contacted by Gravel during the development phase of the Gravel Travel System to provide some thoughts and ideas into the system. In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

            "body": "My review of the Gravel Travel System.\n\nFull disclosure: I was contacted by Gravel during the development phase of the Gravel Travel System to provide some thoughts and ideas into the system. In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag.

I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

            "body": "My review of the Gravel Travel System.\n\nFull disclosure: I was contacted by Gravel during the development phase of the Gravel Travel System to provide some thoughts and ideas into the system. In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces!

            "body": "My review of the Gravel Travel System.\n\nFull disclosure: I was contacted by Gravel during the development phase of the Gravel Travel System to provide some thoughts and ideas into the system. In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

            "body": "My review of the Gravel Travel System.\n\nFull disclosure: I was contacted by Gravel during the development phase of the Gravel Travel System to provide some thoughts and ideas into the system. In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

            "body": "My review of the Gravel Travel System.\n\nFull disclosure: I was contacted by Gravel during the development phase of the Gravel Travel System to provide some thoughts and ideas into the system. In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket. On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

On the front and top, there are small quick access pockets, but they are relatively flat so you’ll probably want to just keep smaller items in there like sunglasses or your wallet. The top access pocket is lined with a felt material and would be a good pocket for your sunglasses. Something else to note is on the main zippers, where you would have valuables such as your laptop, there are lockable zippers, with nice large zipper pulls to quickly get to your items.\n\nMoving to the smaller, 11L day bag, it’s essentially a shrunken down version of the main bag. As the name suggests, once you arrive at your destination, you conveniently pull out this bag from the front pocket of the main bag, and voila, you have a day bag! The difference on this bag is that you have an internal water bottle pocket, and that you can hide away the backpack straps and use the tote straps. I’m unsure if it’s just the version that I have or if it’s on all the day bags, but my tote straps did not have any strap savers, which would have been nice to have. You’ll see that on the top of the backpack straps are G-hooks, which you can use to either strap to the front or the back of the main bag to expand your carrying capacity. I had no problem fitting my ipad, 24oz Hydroflask, my Boundary Supply tech pouch, a Patagonia Micropuff hoodie, and keys, wallet, and AirPods Pro, which would be a perfect office or cafe load out. There’s also that same sweet padded side grab handle in case you wanted to carry this briefcase style in a more professional setting. There isn’t a grab handle up top, which I found strange, but I found out you’re suppose to use one of the tote straps as a top grab handle. I’ve yet to try it out but I do foresee it being a bit awkward to grab, seeing that the tote straps are floppy. Also, in the main compartment, I thought it was a wasted opportunity to not put some sort of organization or pocket on the flap, but it’s not that big of a deal. \n\nThe 2L Sling belt is definitely a nifty little guy. Alone, it is a sling belt, but together with the main 42L bag, it acts as a waist belt. It connects to the main bag via hidden buckles, and is very easily removable for when you’re on a flight. You can pop off the sling belt, which has your essentials, and stow the main bag in the overhead compartment. You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

            "body": "My review of the Gravel Travel System.\n\nFull disclosure: I was contacted by Gravel during the development phase of the Gravel Travel System to provide some thoughts and ideas into the system. In return, I received the system free of charge.\n\nHey everyone, I received the Gravel Travel System after the conclusion of their KickStarter and Indiegogo, and I wanted to showcase it for everyone and provide my feedback for anyone curious about it.\n\nThe Travel System consists of 3 main parts: The main, 42L Carry-on backpack, the 11L day bag, and the 2L Sling belt/waist belt. The thought process was to have 1 complete travel system to get your things to where you need to go, and then have ancillary bags to accommodate you once you’ve arrived at your destination, without the need of unpacking the main bag. \n\nAll bags are made of a 300D Polyester w/TPO Coating w/Outer PU Coating, complimented by YKK Aquaguard zippers on the exterior and standard YKK zippers on the inside. There are strap savers on pretty much all loose straps (elastic on the larger straps and Velcro on smaller straps), which is a very nice attention to detail. It feels very durable with good weatherproofing, so I have no doubts that this bag will last a long time and be able to handle everything you throw at it, including a walk in mild to medium rain.\n\nStarting with the main, 42L bag, my first thought was this was a big bag (21.65\" tall x 14\" wide x 9.25\" deep). Once I put it on though, it felt nice on my back with beefy padding. You can adjust the straps at the top to fit your frame, which is a nice touch. Aside from the beefy padding, there are also load lifters to help alleviate weight and make it more pleasant to haul a heavier load. There are also large padded grab handles on the top and 1 side, which make grabbing the bag without looking much easier. The sternum strap reminds me of Boundary Supply’s sternum system, but the tolerance between each notch is tight enough where you will not have to worry about the sternum strap popping out and losing it. If anything, its a tad too tight, but once you set it up once, you’ll probably never mess with it again. There is kind of a small, awkward grab handle just above the top back padding, which is unnecessary given the top grab handle. You’ll find that the bag fully opens up to the side, with some dividers and lash points to help you organize your clothes and strap them down. I like the ability to organize it how you want, and you probably could get away without using packing cubes. There’s also a small zipper pocket at the bottom on the inside so you can either put their laundry bag in, or you can use it as a small hidden pocket.

You can fit smaller, flatter items in the sling belt like your phone, AirPods, a small book or notebook, snacks, etc. I tried to squeeze in my Micropuff hoodie, as it would be sweet to to store it in there when out and about, but it was a tad too thick for the sling belt. \n\nAside from the system, there are a few awesome small details. The bag that the smaller items come in (11L day bag, sling belt, accessories) is not plastic, but is a biodegradable material. The main 42L bag  comes in this bag that can be turned into a decently large tote bag. I definitely appreciate the Earth consciousness of the packaging and is a detail that isn’t needed at all, but is a very nice touch.\n\nI’ll be using this system on my road trip next weekend and look forward to putting it through its paces! If anyone has any questions or want more pics of anything specific, please don’t hesitate to ask!",

Here are some more photos, including ones next to my GRXC2 and my wife’s black bag for reference as to the color. Also note the 210 back is a deep black with no hint of green (the GRXC2 shoulder strap molly is like a green-black).  The new photos (wood floor) are taken under 3500k LED can lighting and I think the material looks more black than under office fluorescent lighting.\n\nThings to note: the aqua guard zippers are louder than the YKK zippers on the GRXC2 and my Bullets. They are very smooth though. \n\nThe bag stands up on its own. \n\nThe Ultra material is not very crinkly nor is it loud when running your fingers across it. It feels very durable - it feels like it will last a very long time without issue. \n\nThe interior feels smooth and almost waxy to the touch. This pack feels like it will be a breeze to clean if you get it dirty (contrary to the GRXC2). \n\nMy 15inch M15 Alienware fits in the laptop sleeve just fine. I hope this helps.",

        "title": "ILE Travel Pack 40L: Rugged and Comfortable [Review + Pics]",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1k7x3do/ile_travel_pack_40l_rugged_and_comfortable_review/",
        "selftext": "Hey r/onebag, I want to share my experience with the Inside Line Equipment (ILE) Travel Pack 40L. There aren't too many reviews out here on this one, and I've really loved using it so far. I recently took it on a 4-day Hawaii trip, and have taken it on international trips before, and it's quickly become my favorite for larger loads.\n\nOver time, I've moved away from pure ultralight minimalism. For my trips, I need room for essentials, but also for any \"nice-to-have\" items that can really improve my quality of life on the road. I also like to occasionally pick up an item or two on my trips.\n\nThe problem I've found is that fully packed bags can be pretty uncomfortable when maxed out, especially on my broader shoulders (I'm 6'0\"), and many leave no room if I need to stuff anything in last minute or just to hold my partner's jacket. After trying numerous packs that would either dig into my shoulders or sag uncomfortably when fully loaded, this is where the ILE Travel Pack really shines - being able to handle larger loads while remaining remarkably comfortable throughout long travel days.\n\n## The Basics\n\n- **Capacity**: 40L main compartment + 5-10L expandable beavertail\n- **Style**: Panel-loading with roll-top/Cobra buckle combo\n- **Materials**: VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers\n- **Price**: $380 USD\n- **Notable feature**: AustriAlpin Cobra buckle, expandable beavertail, and hip belt (though I didn't use this)\n\n## Bag Layout &amp; Organization\n\nThe ILE Travel Pack has a straightforward but effective organization system:\n\n- **Main compartment**: Spacious clamshell opening with two mesh pockets inside, an area for dirty laundry, and two zippable pockets along the sides I used for smaller items\n- **Laptop compartment**: Front-facing sleeve that fits up to a 16\" laptop\n- **Beavertail**: Expandable front section that buckles with the Cobra clip\n- **Top pocket**: Quick access pocket... but has a major quirk I'll mention later.\n- **Front pocket**: Built into the beavertail for small items\n- **Side water bottle pockets**: One on each side -- zippable so you can use these for storage too\n\n## What I Packed &amp; Where\n\nThe clamshell main compartment makes packing simple and straightforward. Its boxy shape is perfect for maximizing usable space:\n\n- **Main compartment**:\n    - Peak Design medium packing cube with 4 days of clothes\n    - Peak Design shoe cube containing size 10 running shoes\n    - Peak Design wash kit\n    - Airpods Max headphones on top\n    - Sandals\n    - Mini first aid kit, airtag, and face masks\n- **Top mesh pocket**:\n    - Passport\n    - Tom Bihn Nik's minimalist wallet\n    - Battery pack\n- **Bottom mesh pocket**:\n    - Chargers and cables\n- **Front pocket**: Airpods, pen, and quick-access items - perfect for grabbing by just swinging the bag over one shoulder\n- **Top pocket**: Sunglasses in a case. This is my least favorite pocket. Its volume starts at the zipper toward the front, so if you open it with the bag on its back, items can fall out. I use the front pocket for most quick-access needs instead.\n- **Laptop compartment**: MacBook Air and Supernote Manta (feels slightly off-balance when the main compartment's empty, but adding a jacket inside fixes this minor quirk)\n\nThe beavertail is an expandable front section that adds that extra 5-10L of overflow space. What I love about it is the flexibility it provides - it gives me serious peace of mind knowing I have that extra space for anything from my partner's jacket to souvenirs picked up along the way. Unbuckling the Cobra is required for bigger items, but that's a minor inconvenience for the flexibility it provides.\n\nOne small note: The water bottle pockets are quite tight when the main compartment is fully packed. They probably couldn't fit a Nalgene if the main compartment is totally packed, but I don't typically use them for that purpose.\n\n## Comfort: Where This Bag Really Excels\n\nI've tried quite a few travel bags over the years - the Tom Bihn Synik 30, Patagonia Black Hole 32L, and even the Tom Bihn Technonaut 45L. Most of them start to get uncomfortable or sag when fully packed out, especially with my broader shoulder frame. What sets the ILE Travel Pack apart is how it handles weight distribution. The thick foam straps and substantial frame sheet distribute 15-20 lbs with ease, no hip belt needed.\n\nWhat impressed me most is how the weight stays close to my back with zero sagging, even after hours of airport trudging. While not designed as a hiking pack, for urban travel and airport marathons, it's remarkably comfortable. The most surprising comparison was with my Technonaut 45L - despite similar capacity ratings, the ILE carries more comfortably with noticeably less sag when both are fully loaded, which makes a huge difference during long travel days.\n\n## Travel Experience\n\nThe AustriAlpin Cobra buckle is both a high-end hardware choice and genuinely functional. It's satisfyingly solid to clip and keeps both the rolltop and beavertail secure. When you unbuckle it, you get top-loader style access for grabbing things like a jacket, headphones, or your laptop. There's a slight learning curve, but you get used to it quickly.\n\nThe bag fits under airplane seats (somewhat snugly) and slides into overhead bins without issue. The beavertail proved invaluable for stashing souvenirs and extra gear on the return journey. One downside worth noting: the panel-loader design needs space to open fully, so accessing everything in cramped environments can be challenging. However, the Cobra buckle gives you that top-loader style access when you're in tight spaces.\n\n## Day-to-Day Use\n\nWhile this served as my day bag in my travels (both in Hawaii and on business trips to Europe), at 40L it's admittedly bulky for everyday carry, especially if you have a smaller frame. When cinched down with the side compression straps, it's manageable but not ideal. The front-placed laptop compartment also feels slightly awkward when the main compartment is empty. If I had options, I'd grab a smaller bag for EDC.\n\n## Durability\n\nThis pack is built like a tank. The VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers, and Cobra buckle are all premium components designed to last. I've already taken it through rain on a previous trip, and everything stayed completely dry. I've tossed it in bins, dragged it across airports—no scratches or signs of wear.\n\n## The Verdict\n\n### Pros\n\n- Top-tier comfort for broad shoulders and heavier loads\n- Spacious 40L plus 5-10L beavertail overflow (even without overflow, fits more than Tom Bihn Technonaut rated at 45L)\n- Bombproof VX21, YKK zips, Cobra buckle\n- Cobra buckle provides quick top-loader style access\n- Clean, functional organization\n- Outstanding weight distribution with zero sag\n\n### Cons\n\n- Top pocket design can be problematic - items can fall out when opened with the bag on its back\n- Laptop compartment feels off-balance when main compartment's empty (adding a jacket or light item helps fix this)\n- Water bottle pockets are tight when fully packed\n- Too bulky for daily use for many people\n- Premium price point at $380\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nI didn't expect to love the ILE Travel Pack 40L as much as I do. For those who prioritize comfort, durability, and thoughtful design over ultralight minimalism or tech maximalism, this pack delivers. Its quirks (top pocket, laptop placement) are managable, but would be great if they could fix them. For comfort-first travel with room for both essentials and some luxuries, it's become my new go-to.\n\nFor those wanting pure minimalism or tons of organizational compartments, look elsewhere. But if you want a bomber bag that can handle serious loads without punishing your shoulders, the ILE Travel Pack 40L is one to consider.\n\nQuestions? Want specific details?

Even the manufacturer's website did not specify the weight (never a good sign), but according to another independent review the weight is 4 lbs 4 oz / 1.93 kg.  Not too bad given the features and apparent robustness, but definitely not a bag for lightweight fans.   \n\n**Dimensions**.  12 x 8 x 21 inches / 30.5 x 20.3 x 53.3 cm.  This computes to 33.0 L, which is 7L different from the stated 40L capacity, although per the website photos 40L seems visually about right.  Of course dimensions and capacity can be tricky to measure with complete accuracy and consistency.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1k7x3do/ile_travel_pack_40l_rugged_and_comfortable_review/",
        "selftext": "Hey r/onebag, I want to share my experience with the Inside Line Equipment (ILE) Travel Pack 40L. There aren't too many reviews out here on this one, and I've really loved using it so far. I recently took it on a 4-day Hawaii trip, and have taken it on international trips before, and it's quickly become my favorite for larger loads.\n\nOver time, I've moved away from pure ultralight minimalism. For my trips, I need room for essentials, but also for any \"nice-to-have\" items that can really improve my quality of life on the road. I also like to occasionally pick up an item or two on my trips.\n\nThe problem I've found is that fully packed bags can be pretty uncomfortable when maxed out, especially on my broader shoulders (I'm 6'0\"), and many leave no room if I need to stuff anything in last minute or just to hold my partner's jacket. After trying numerous packs that would either dig into my shoulders or sag uncomfortably when fully loaded, this is where the ILE Travel Pack really shines - being able to handle larger loads while remaining remarkably comfortable throughout long travel days.\n\n## The Basics\n\n- **Capacity**: 40L main compartment + 5-10L expandable beavertail\n- **Style**: Panel-loading with roll-top/Cobra buckle combo\n- **Materials**: VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers\n- **Price**: $380 USD\n- **Notable feature**: AustriAlpin Cobra buckle, expandable beavertail, and hip belt (though I didn't use this)\n\n## Bag Layout &amp; Organization\n\nThe ILE Travel Pack has a straightforward but effective organization system:\n\n- **Main compartment**: Spacious clamshell opening with two mesh pockets inside, an area for dirty laundry, and two zippable pockets along the sides I used for smaller items\n- **Laptop compartment**: Front-facing sleeve that fits up to a 16\" laptop\n- **Beavertail**: Expandable front section that buckles with the Cobra clip\n- **Top pocket**: Quick access pocket... but has a major quirk I'll mention later.\n- **Front pocket**: Built into the beavertail for small items\n- **Side water bottle pockets**: One on each side -- zippable so you can use these for storage too\n\n## What I Packed &amp; Where\n\nThe clamshell main compartment makes packing simple and straightforward. Its boxy shape is perfect for maximizing usable space:\n\n- **Main compartment**:\n    - Peak Design medium packing cube with 4 days of clothes\n    - Peak Design shoe cube containing size 10 running shoes\n    - Peak Design wash kit\n    - Airpods Max headphones on top\n    - Sandals\n    - Mini first aid kit, airtag, and face masks\n- **Top mesh pocket**:\n    - Passport\n    - Tom Bihn Nik's minimalist wallet\n    - Battery pack\n- **Bottom mesh pocket**:\n    - Chargers and cables\n- **Front pocket**: Airpods, pen, and quick-access items - perfect for grabbing by just swinging the bag over one shoulder\n- **Top pocket**: Sunglasses in a case. This is my least favorite pocket. Its volume starts at the zipper toward the front, so if you open it with the bag on its back, items can fall out. I use the front pocket for most quick-access needs instead.\n- **Laptop compartment**: MacBook Air and Supernote Manta (feels slightly off-balance when the main compartment's empty, but adding a jacket inside fixes this minor quirk)\n\nThe beavertail is an expandable front section that adds that extra 5-10L of overflow space. What I love about it is the flexibility it provides - it gives me serious peace of mind knowing I have that extra space for anything from my partner's jacket to souvenirs picked up along the way. Unbuckling the Cobra is required for bigger items, but that's a minor inconvenience for the flexibility it provides.\n\nOne small note: The water bottle pockets are quite tight when the main compartment is fully packed. They probably couldn't fit a Nalgene if the main compartment is totally packed, but I don't typically use them for that purpose.\n\n## Comfort: Where This Bag Really Excels\n\nI've tried quite a few travel bags over the years - the Tom Bihn Synik 30, Patagonia Black Hole 32L, and even the Tom Bihn Technonaut 45L. Most of them start to get uncomfortable or sag when fully packed out, especially with my broader shoulder frame. What sets the ILE Travel Pack apart is how it handles weight distribution. The thick foam straps and substantial frame sheet distribute 15-20 lbs with ease, no hip belt needed.\n\nWhat impressed me most is how the weight stays close to my back with zero sagging, even after hours of airport trudging. While not designed as a hiking pack, for urban travel and airport marathons, it's remarkably comfortable. The most surprising comparison was with my Technonaut 45L - despite similar capacity ratings, the ILE carries more comfortably with noticeably less sag when both are fully loaded, which makes a huge difference during long travel days.\n\n## Travel Experience\n\nThe AustriAlpin Cobra buckle is both a high-end hardware choice and genuinely functional. It's satisfyingly solid to clip and keeps both the rolltop and beavertail secure. When you unbuckle it, you get top-loader style access for grabbing things like a jacket, headphones, or your laptop. There's a slight learning curve, but you get used to it quickly.\n\nThe bag fits under airplane seats (somewhat snugly) and slides into overhead bins without issue. The beavertail proved invaluable for stashing souvenirs and extra gear on the return journey. One downside worth noting: the panel-loader design needs space to open fully, so accessing everything in cramped environments can be challenging. However, the Cobra buckle gives you that top-loader style access when you're in tight spaces.\n\n## Day-to-Day Use\n\nWhile this served as my day bag in my travels (both in Hawaii and on business trips to Europe), at 40L it's admittedly bulky for everyday carry, especially if you have a smaller frame. When cinched down with the side compression straps, it's manageable but not ideal. The front-placed laptop compartment also feels slightly awkward when the main compartment is empty. If I had options, I'd grab a smaller bag for EDC.\n\n## Durability\n\nThis pack is built like a tank. The VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers, and Cobra buckle are all premium components designed to last. I've already taken it through rain on a previous trip, and everything stayed completely dry. I've tossed it in bins, dragged it across airports—no scratches or signs of wear.\n\n## The Verdict\n\n### Pros\n\n- Top-tier comfort for broad shoulders and heavier loads\n- Spacious 40L plus 5-10L beavertail overflow (even without overflow, fits more than Tom Bihn Technonaut rated at 45L)\n- Bombproof VX21, YKK zips, Cobra buckle\n- Cobra buckle provides quick top-loader style access\n- Clean, functional organization\n- Outstanding weight distribution with zero sag\n\n### Cons\n\n- Top pocket design can be problematic - items can fall out when opened with the bag on its back\n- Laptop compartment feels off-balance when main compartment's empty (adding a jacket or light item helps fix this)\n- Water bottle pockets are tight when fully packed\n- Too bulky for daily use for many people\n- Premium price point at $380\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nI didn't expect to love the ILE Travel Pack 40L as much as I do. For those who prioritize comfort, durability, and thoughtful design over ultralight minimalism or tech maximalism, this pack delivers. Its quirks (top pocket, laptop placement) are managable, but would be great if they could fix them. For comfort-first travel with room for both essentials and some luxuries, it's become my new go-to.\n\nFor those wanting pure minimalism or tons of organizational compartments, look elsewhere. But if you want a bomber bag that can handle serious loads without punishing your shoulders, the ILE Travel Pack 40L is one to consider.\n\nQuestions? Want specific details?

When cinched down with the side compression straps, it's manageable but not ideal. The front-placed laptop compartment also feels slightly awkward when the main compartment is empty. If I had options, I'd grab a smaller bag for EDC.\n\n## Durability\n\nThis pack is built like a tank. The VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers, and Cobra buckle are all premium components designed to last. I've already taken it through rain on a previous trip, and everything stayed completely dry. I've tossed it in bins, dragged it across airports—no scratches or signs of wear.\n\n## The Verdict\n\n### Pros\n\n- Top-tier comfort for broad shoulders and heavier loads\n- Spacious 40L plus 5-10L beavertail overflow (even without overflow, fits more than Tom Bihn Technonaut rated at 45L)\n- Bombproof VX21, YKK zips, Cobra buckle\n- Cobra buckle provides quick top-loader style access\n- Clean, functional organization\n- Outstanding weight distribution with zero sag\n\n### Cons\n\n- Top pocket design can be problematic - items can fall out when opened with the bag on its back\n- Laptop compartment feels off-balance when main compartment's empty (adding a jacket or light item helps fix this)\n- Water bottle pockets are tight when fully packed\n- Too bulky for daily use for many people\n- Premium price point at $380\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nI didn't expect to love the ILE Travel Pack 40L as much as I do. For those who prioritize comfort, durability, and thoughtful design over ultralight minimalism or tech maximalism, this pack delivers. Its quirks (top pocket, laptop placement) are managable, but would be great if they could fix them. For comfort-first travel with room for both essentials and some luxuries, it's become my new go-to.\n\nFor those wanting pure minimalism or tons of organizational compartments, look elsewhere. But if you want a bomber bag that can handle serious loads without punishing your shoulders, the ILE Travel Pack 40L is one to consider.\n\nQuestions? Want specific details?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1k7x3do/ile_travel_pack_40l_rugged_and_comfortable_review/",
        "selftext": "Hey r/onebag, I want to share my experience with the Inside Line Equipment (ILE) Travel Pack 40L. There aren't too many reviews out here on this one, and I've really loved using it so far. I recently took it on a 4-day Hawaii trip, and have taken it on international trips before, and it's quickly become my favorite for larger loads.\n\nOver time, I've moved away from pure ultralight minimalism. For my trips, I need room for essentials, but also for any \"nice-to-have\" items that can really improve my quality of life on the road. I also like to occasionally pick up an item or two on my trips.\n\nThe problem I've found is that fully packed bags can be pretty uncomfortable when maxed out, especially on my broader shoulders (I'm 6'0\"), and many leave no room if I need to stuff anything in last minute or just to hold my partner's jacket. After trying numerous packs that would either dig into my shoulders or sag uncomfortably when fully loaded, this is where the ILE Travel Pack really shines - being able to handle larger loads while remaining remarkably comfortable throughout long travel days.\n\n## The Basics\n\n- **Capacity**: 40L main compartment + 5-10L expandable beavertail\n- **Style**: Panel-loading with roll-top/Cobra buckle combo\n- **Materials**: VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers\n- **Price**: $380 USD\n- **Notable feature**: AustriAlpin Cobra buckle, expandable beavertail, and hip belt (though I didn't use this)\n\n## Bag Layout &amp; Organization\n\nThe ILE Travel Pack has a straightforward but effective organization system:\n\n- **Main compartment**: Spacious clamshell opening with two mesh pockets inside, an area for dirty laundry, and two zippable pockets along the sides I used for smaller items\n- **Laptop compartment**: Front-facing sleeve that fits up to a 16\" laptop\n- **Beavertail**: Expandable front section that buckles with the Cobra clip\n- **Top pocket**: Quick access pocket... but has a major quirk I'll mention later.\n- **Front pocket**: Built into the beavertail for small items\n- **Side water bottle pockets**: One on each side -- zippable so you can use these for storage too\n\n## What I Packed &amp; Where\n\nThe clamshell main compartment makes packing simple and straightforward. Its boxy shape is perfect for maximizing usable space:\n\n- **Main compartment**:\n    - Peak Design medium packing cube with 4 days of clothes\n    - Peak Design shoe cube containing size 10 running shoes\n    - Peak Design wash kit\n    - Airpods Max headphones on top\n    - Sandals\n    - Mini first aid kit, airtag, and face masks\n- **Top mesh pocket**:\n    - Passport\n    - Tom Bihn Nik's minimalist wallet\n    - Battery pack\n- **Bottom mesh pocket**:\n    - Chargers and cables\n- **Front pocket**: Airpods, pen, and quick-access items - perfect for grabbing by just swinging the bag over one shoulder\n- **Top pocket**: Sunglasses in a case. This is my least favorite pocket. Its volume starts at the zipper toward the front, so if you open it with the bag on its back, items can fall out. I use the front pocket for most quick-access needs instead.\n- **Laptop compartment**: MacBook Air and Supernote Manta (feels slightly off-balance when the main compartment's empty, but adding a jacket inside fixes this minor quirk)\n\nThe beavertail is an expandable front section that adds that extra 5-10L of overflow space. What I love about it is the flexibility it provides - it gives me serious peace of mind knowing I have that extra space for anything from my partner's jacket to souvenirs picked up along the way. Unbuckling the Cobra is required for bigger items, but that's a minor inconvenience for the flexibility it provides.\n\nOne small note: The water bottle pockets are quite tight when the main compartment is fully packed. They probably couldn't fit a Nalgene if the main compartment is totally packed, but I don't typically use them for that purpose.\n\n## Comfort: Where This Bag Really Excels\n\nI've tried quite a few travel bags over the years - the Tom Bihn Synik 30, Patagonia Black Hole 32L, and even the Tom Bihn Technonaut 45L. Most of them start to get uncomfortable or sag when fully packed out, especially with my broader shoulder frame. What sets the ILE Travel Pack apart is how it handles weight distribution. The thick foam straps and substantial frame sheet distribute 15-20 lbs with ease, no hip belt needed.\n\nWhat impressed me most is how the weight stays close to my back with zero sagging, even after hours of airport trudging. While not designed as a hiking pack, for urban travel and airport marathons, it's remarkably comfortable. The most surprising comparison was with my Technonaut 45L - despite similar capacity ratings, the ILE carries more comfortably with noticeably less sag when both are fully loaded, which makes a huge difference during long travel days.\n\n## Travel Experience\n\nThe AustriAlpin Cobra buckle is both a high-end hardware choice and genuinely functional. It's satisfyingly solid to clip and keeps both the rolltop and beavertail secure. When you unbuckle it, you get top-loader style access for grabbing things like a jacket, headphones, or your laptop. There's a slight learning curve, but you get used to it quickly.\n\nThe bag fits under airplane seats (somewhat snugly) and slides into overhead bins without issue. The beavertail proved invaluable for stashing souvenirs and extra gear on the return journey. One downside worth noting: the panel-loader design needs space to open fully, so accessing everything in cramped environments can be challenging. However, the Cobra buckle gives you that top-loader style access when you're in tight spaces.\n\n## Day-to-Day Use\n\nWhile this served as my day bag in my travels (both in Hawaii and on business trips to Europe), at 40L it's admittedly bulky for everyday carry, especially if you have a smaller frame. When cinched down with the side compression straps, it's manageable but not ideal. The front-placed laptop compartment also feels slightly awkward when the main compartment is empty. If I had options, I'd grab a smaller bag for EDC.\n\n## Durability\n\nThis pack is built like a tank. The VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers, and Cobra buckle are all premium components designed to last. I've already taken it through rain on a previous trip, and everything stayed completely dry. I've tossed it in bins, dragged it across airports—no scratches or signs of wear.\n\n## The Verdict\n\n### Pros\n\n- Top-tier comfort for broad shoulders and heavier loads\n- Spacious 40L plus 5-10L beavertail overflow (even without overflow, fits more than Tom Bihn Technonaut rated at 45L)\n- Bombproof VX21, YKK zips, Cobra buckle\n- Cobra buckle provides quick top-loader style access\n- Clean, functional organization\n- Outstanding weight distribution with zero sag\n\n### Cons\n\n- Top pocket design can be problematic - items can fall out when opened with the bag on its back\n- Laptop compartment feels off-balance when main compartment's empty (adding a jacket or light item helps fix this)\n- Water bottle pockets are tight when fully packed\n- Too bulky for daily use for many people\n- Premium price point at $380\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nI didn't expect to love the ILE Travel Pack 40L as much as I do. For those who prioritize comfort, durability, and thoughtful design over ultralight minimalism or tech maximalism, this pack delivers.

I also like to occasionally pick up an item or two on my trips.\n\nThe problem I've found is that fully packed bags can be pretty uncomfortable when maxed out, especially on my broader shoulders (I'm 6'0\"), and many leave no room if I need to stuff anything in last minute or just to hold my partner's jacket. After trying numerous packs that would either dig into my shoulders or sag uncomfortably when fully loaded, this is where the ILE Travel Pack really shines - being able to handle larger loads while remaining remarkably comfortable throughout long travel days.\n\n## The Basics\n\n- **Capacity**: 40L main compartment + 5-10L expandable beavertail\n- **Style**: Panel-loading with roll-top/Cobra buckle combo\n- **Materials**: VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers\n- **Price**: $380 USD\n- **Notable feature**: AustriAlpin Cobra buckle, expandable beavertail, and hip belt (though I didn't use this)\n\n## Bag Layout &amp; Organization\n\nThe ILE Travel Pack has a straightforward but effective organization system:\n\n- **Main compartment**: Spacious clamshell opening with two mesh pockets inside, an area for dirty laundry, and two zippable pockets along the sides I used for smaller items\n- **Laptop compartment**: Front-facing sleeve that fits up to a 16\" laptop\n- **Beavertail**: Expandable front section that buckles with the Cobra clip\n- **Top pocket**: Quick access pocket... but has a major quirk I'll mention later.\n- **Front pocket**: Built into the beavertail for small items\n- **Side water bottle pockets**: One on each side -- zippable so you can use these for storage too\n\n## What I Packed &amp; Where\n\nThe clamshell main compartment makes packing simple and straightforward. Its boxy shape is perfect for maximizing usable space:\n\n- **Main compartment**:\n    - Peak Design medium packing cube with 4 days of clothes\n    - Peak Design shoe cube containing size 10 running shoes\n    - Peak Design wash kit\n    - Airpods Max headphones on top\n    - Sandals\n    - Mini first aid kit, airtag, and face masks\n- **Top mesh pocket**:\n    - Passport\n    - Tom Bihn Nik's minimalist wallet\n    - Battery pack\n- **Bottom mesh pocket**:\n    - Chargers and cables\n- **Front pocket**: Airpods, pen, and quick-access items - perfect for grabbing by just swinging the bag over one shoulder\n- **Top pocket**: Sunglasses in a case. This is my least favorite pocket. Its volume starts at the zipper toward the front, so if you open it with the bag on its back, items can fall out. I use the front pocket for most quick-access needs instead.\n- **Laptop compartment**: MacBook Air and Supernote Manta (feels slightly off-balance when the main compartment's empty, but adding a jacket inside fixes this minor quirk)\n\nThe beavertail is an expandable front section that adds that extra 5-10L of overflow space. What I love about it is the flexibility it provides - it gives me serious peace of mind knowing I have that extra space for anything from my partner's jacket to souvenirs picked up along the way. Unbuckling the Cobra is required for bigger items, but that's a minor inconvenience for the flexibility it provides.\n\nOne small note: The water bottle pockets are quite tight when the main compartment is fully packed. They probably couldn't fit a Nalgene if the main compartment is totally packed, but I don't typically use them for that purpose.\n\n## Comfort: Where This Bag Really Excels\n\nI've tried quite a few travel bags over the years - the Tom Bihn Synik 30, Patagonia Black Hole 32L, and even the Tom Bihn Technonaut 45L. Most of them start to get uncomfortable or sag when fully packed out, especially with my broader shoulder frame. What sets the ILE Travel Pack apart is how it handles weight distribution. The thick foam straps and substantial frame sheet distribute 15-20 lbs with ease, no hip belt needed.\n\nWhat impressed me most is how the weight stays close to my back with zero sagging, even after hours of airport trudging. While not designed as a hiking pack, for urban travel and airport marathons, it's remarkably comfortable. The most surprising comparison was with my Technonaut 45L - despite similar capacity ratings, the ILE carries more comfortably with noticeably less sag when both are fully loaded, which makes a huge difference during long travel days.\n\n## Travel Experience\n\nThe AustriAlpin Cobra buckle is both a high-end hardware choice and genuinely functional. It's satisfyingly solid to clip and keeps both the rolltop and beavertail secure. When you unbuckle it, you get top-loader style access for grabbing things like a jacket, headphones, or your laptop. There's a slight learning curve, but you get used to it quickly.\n\nThe bag fits under airplane seats (somewhat snugly) and slides into overhead bins without issue. The beavertail proved invaluable for stashing souvenirs and extra gear on the return journey. One downside worth noting: the panel-loader design needs space to open fully, so accessing everything in cramped environments can be challenging. However, the Cobra buckle gives you that top-loader style access when you're in tight spaces.\n\n## Day-to-Day Use\n\nWhile this served as my day bag in my travels (both in Hawaii and on business trips to Europe), at 40L it's admittedly bulky for everyday carry, especially if you have a smaller frame. When cinched down with the side compression straps, it's manageable but not ideal. The front-placed laptop compartment also feels slightly awkward when the main compartment is empty. If I had options, I'd grab a smaller bag for EDC.\n\n## Durability\n\nThis pack is built like a tank. The VX21 fabric, water-sealed YKK zippers, and Cobra buckle are all premium components designed to last. I've already taken it through rain on a previous trip, and everything stayed completely dry. I've tossed it in bins, dragged it across airports—no scratches or signs of wear.\n\n## The Verdict\n\n### Pros\n\n- Top-tier comfort for broad shoulders and heavier loads\n- Spacious 40L plus 5-10L beavertail overflow (even without overflow, fits more than Tom Bihn Technonaut rated at 45L)\n- Bombproof VX21, YKK zips, Cobra buckle\n- Cobra buckle provides quick top-loader style access\n- Clean, functional organization\n- Outstanding weight distribution with zero sag\n\n### Cons\n\n- Top pocket design can be problematic - items can fall out when opened with the bag on its back\n- Laptop compartment feels off-balance when main compartment's empty (adding a jacket or light item helps fix this)\n- Water bottle pockets are tight when fully packed\n- Too bulky for daily use for many people\n- Premium price point at $380\n\n## Wrap-Up\n\nI didn't expect to love the ILE Travel Pack 40L as much as I do. For those who prioritize comfort, durability, and thoughtful design over ultralight minimalism or tech maximalism, this pack delivers. Its quirks (top pocket, laptop placement) are managable, but would be great if they could fix them. For comfort-first travel with room for both essentials and some luxuries, it's become my new go-to.\n\nFor those wanting pure minimalism or tons of organizational compartments, look elsewhere. But if you want a bomber bag that can handle serious loads without punishing your shoulders, the ILE Travel Pack 40L is one to consider.\n\nQuestions? Want specific details?

Not too bad given the features and apparent robustness, but definitely not a bag for lightweight fans.   \n\n**Dimensions**.  12 x 8 x 21 inches / 30.5 x 20.3 x 53.3 cm.

As advertised, the bag is realllly light and roomy (2lbs 13oz)\n\nI’ve had two other onebags over the years (an Aer2 and the Topo Global traveler) and had hoped this bag would address what I found problematic about both - namely, the weight on my shoulders when I loaded my gear. \n\nBeing accustomed to backpacking packs where you can really shift weight to your hips and off your shoulders, I have found this to be a stupid design bug of most travel backpacks. I am happy to report the KotaUL does that same\nmagic as a hiking pack thanks to some well-engineered load lifters and a very functional, removable hip belt. \n\nJust to see, I threw two 8-lb dumbbells and a pillow in the bag to see how it felt and am happy to report that I experienced *zero neck or shoulder pain*.\n\nThings to consider: I am 5’11 with a 16” torso. If you are shorter than 5’8, this is not your bag as there is no sizing or shoulder strap adjustment and you will bonk your head on the removable frame. I don’t love the frame height tbh but figure that’s probably what makes the load lifters work this well.\n\nI purchased the cube and compression bag. The cube fits my tablet and comes with accessory straps for either a backpack or in-seat sling. I wouldn’t want hike with it, but it was designed to fit the shape of the main compartment so that’s handy. \n\nSpecs\n10x12x22 inch\n\nBase Weight: 2 lbs 13 oz\n\nWeight With Accessory Straps: 2 lbs 15 oz\n\nSize: 45L (37L main compartment)\n\nFabric: 210D Nylon with 400D Spectra Ripstop Grid\n\nWater Resistance: 1500 mm HH (not seam taped)\n\nInternal Frame (removable): 22 inches (vertical) - Aluminum\n\nFive star bag!",

The YKK zips feels very smooth.\n* They can be stuffed easily from the duffel style opening, its roomy and without any organizing feature.\n* The size difference dont seems as big as the numbers suggest : the 40L dont seems 42% bigger than the 28L.\n* It has two more compartments, one at the top near the handle, one on the front .\n* The two side bottle holders are all right, not small, not big. They dont take space.\n* The compression straps are useful and makes and bags way smaller when not fully packed.\n* Its a shame that the main zipper hasn't a lockable zipper, but the laptop compartment zipper does.\n* Speaking of laptop compartment, i dont like at all the way it opens spilt in half, i don't see the point, and it adds complexity with the extra opening inside, in a bag that want to be minimalistic. In every airport, they ask you to take your laptop out anyway.\n* The handles and shoulder straps are well padded, as is the back support.\n* The price is very attractive, \\~82€ for the 40L, \\~72€ for the 26L on Amazon.\n\nI decided to not keep any of them. The 40L is too big for me, and without a hip belt, you can't load it that much. The 28L is the ideal size, especially as an EDC, but my current backpack (pictured bellow, i removed the Nike logo) is enough for now, even if it lacks a luggage pass through, and i don't like the top opening.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jqj9t1jy2jnc1.jpeg?width=4080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30cfffbd6e7e3d82dba3e9c7a22284a57c9ca86b",

If you have a laptop bigger than 15 that would also be a plus.\n\n\n\nAs others said the fit or weight can also be a factor here, for me in this case doesn't really matter that much since both models are not huge backpacks.\n\n\n\nFor traveling however, considering you don't often pack heavy you will most likely fill up the 28L while with the 40L you might not fill it all the way.\n\n\n\nI honestly don't thing you lose a lot buying one or the other.\n\n \n\nHere are the sizes:\n\n* Tomtoc Navigator T66 40L: **20.5** in x 13 in x 8.66 in **(52.1** x 33 x 22 cm)\n* Tomtoc Navigator T66 28L: **18.11** in x 11.81 in x 7.87 in (**46** x 30 x 20 cm)\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/evlrvvfo3f4e1.jpeg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3ed13e28de75303f95eae6cf080cca6c781d1b8",

The 30L seems a good size with decent amount of storage. Laptop is protected by a stiff plate between it and the backpack straps. Backpack straps are nicely padded, nuch nore robust than their Lite ready packs.\n\nThe main compartment and top pocket zippers do not having locking loops on them, but the lower pocket and thr laptop pocket have a fanncy zipper where it can only be opened if the zipper is lifted up.\n\nThere's also an attachment loop top right of the bag, that lines with anothet loop bottom right of the bag, which would seem suggest a shoilder strap for duffel carry, but Bellroy doesn't supply such a strap.\n",

Wish it did not go so high as the pack is stuck being tall. But perfect otherwise. \n\nMy idea, cut the bag open, cut the back part to a shorter size, then sew back together. But not wanting to ruin the durability of the bag.\n\nAny feedback would be great! Thanks",

They exclude normal wear and tear, but they also mention zipper/seam failures that are the most common failure points. Which is weird, otherwise they could just hide behind \"you've damaged it more than our warranty covers, this is not a manufacturing defect.\" \n\nI also am not surprised your bag fell apart though, their stuff has always been super expensive for what seems like PVC tarpaulin fabric.

They exclude normal wear and tear, but they also mention zipper/seam failures that are the most common failure points. Which is weird, otherwise they could just hide behind \"you've damaged it more than our warranty covers, this is not a manufacturing defect.\" \n\nI also am not surprised your bag fell apart though, their stuff has always been super expensive for what seems like PVC tarpaulin fabric. I got a packing cube from them for $30 and the inner seams weren't finished, just exposed and fraying. Returned it immediately.",

Keen to pick up a backpack that can handle the normal laptop, charger, water bottle, etc., but also leaves some room to pack in any running gear or shopping I may pick up during the day. \n\nCame across these Gomatic bags on Amazon UK. They look great, as the bag is expandable to cater for those extra bits. \n\nHas anyone used one before? They are on the more expensive side (£279) so wanting to look at options. \n\nThanks all. ",
