Long time lurker, first time poster here.\nI figured it might be interesting (or entertaining, at least) for some of you folks to see some very simple work I did on my well used Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21 for it to better suit my needs.\n\nFirst of all, I can't hide the fact that I love heat shrink tubing. I use it on almost all of my zipper pulls, both on clothes and on bags. I'll either apply it to the whole zipper pull to make it stiff or just to the knots to have a more tactile end to grab. Then of course, my UA21 could be no different. I decided not to completely enclose the cord pulls though so I can still use a small S-biner to secure them to one another in case I need further protection from pickpockets or similar.\n\nThe second very simple but very useful mod I did was attaching some elastic cordage to control the remaining webbing. You basically need to put the shock cord through the loop at the end of the strap and then tie it to the working  part of the webbing that is under tension, then roll it up and call it a day. Heat shrink on the knot is not necessary but... what can I say?\n\nThe last thing I did was replacing the black zipper pulls on the inside pockets with bright fuchsia ones. I am certainly not a fan of dark bag interiors and I thought these would be just enough to help me locate those pockets faster.\n\nSo, finishing up, what are some modifications you guys like to do to your own bags? Do yo recommend any in particular?",

Long time lurker, first time poster here.\nI figured it might be interesting (or entertaining, at least) for some of you folks to see some very simple work I did on my well used Mystery Ranch Urban Assault 21 for it to better suit my needs.\n\nFirst of all, I can't hide the fact that I love heat shrink tubing. I use it on almost all of my zipper pulls, both on clothes and on bags. I'll either apply it to the whole zipper pull to make it stiff or just to the knots to have a more tactile end to grab. Then of course, my UA21 could be no different. I decided not to completely enclose the cord pulls though so I can still use a small S-biner to secure them to one another in case I need further protection from pickpockets or similar.\n\nThe second very simple but very useful mod I did was attaching some elastic cordage to control the remaining webbing. You basically need to put the shock cord through the loop at the end of the strap and then tie it to the working  part of the webbing that is under tension, then roll it up and call it a day. Heat shrink on the knot is not necessary but... what can I say?\n\nThe last thing I did was replacing the black zipper pulls on the inside pockets with bright fuchsia ones. I am certainly not a fan of dark bag interiors and I thought these would be just enough to help me locate those pockets faster.\n\nSo, finishing up, what are some modifications you guys like to do to your own bags? Do yo recommend any in particular?",

I bought it used from GearTrade.com where it was listed simply as a Mystery Ranch Backpack. \n\nThings I’ve noticed; the top handle is thin and flat, unlike other bags of theirs I have seen. It’s also missing the top interior zippered mesh pocket right above the pen slots. Could it be a the 22? \n\nThat said, this is my first Mystery Ranch product and I am impressed. ",

        "selftext": "I was looking for a backpack reminiscent of the Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault, which I've been very fond of, but it was too tactically inclined.\n\nThe bag is very well proportioned, and the small pockets and mesh pockets are incredibly effective for organizing my EDC gear. The two mesh pockets on the sides are very shallow, almost too shallow for anything other than a wallet and keys; here they could have easily been made deeper, similar to the 2 Day Assault. Both the color and overall profile make it very urban and fit well in all environments, from the office to travel without standing out among the crowd.\n\n75% of the backpack's contact area is primarily on the lower back. There is very little contact with the rest of the back when walking; it requires very careful adjustment to get more contact with the backpack in the upper part of the back, and it varies quite a bit depending on how much weight is in the backpack.\n\nThe load lifters on the straps are very welcome, as the backpack tends to pull and lean slightly backward if not tightened. Especially in the beginning, this was an awkward sensation and caused discomfort in the upper back and shoulders, but it has improved significantly after getting to know the adjustments better.\n\nThe length of the backpack is fine and very similar to a Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault with the back panel set in the middle position. I am 180 cm tall (5.9 feet), and both the harness and the length of the bag fit well.\n\nThe zippers are some of the most functional I've seen in a long time. There are small loops at all ends of the zippers, making it incredibly easy to zip. It's a very functional tri-zip backpack. The new zipper pulls are also super grippy; I wish more manufacturers used similar pulls.\n\nThe bag is relatively waterproof; for the most part, the rain sits directly on top of the fabric and slides off.\n\nThe non-elastic bottle pockets on the sides are effective; however, they lack the option to be tightened at the top, as bottles easily slide out when the bag is lying horizontally, for example, in the overhead compartment of a plane or train.\n\nThe divided laptop compartment is one of the best laptop compartments I have seen. If I were a university student needing to carry books, folders, a laptop, and possibly an iPad, I would not hesitate to choose the Catalyst 26 as one of the best options, despite room for improvement. Compared to the Urban Assault, which largely disappointed on all fronts, the Catalyst is light-years ahead in both ergonomics and internal organization.",

        "selftext": "I was looking for a backpack reminiscent of the Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault, which I've been very fond of, but it was too tactically inclined.\n\nThe bag is very well proportioned, and the small pockets and mesh pockets are incredibly effective for organizing my EDC gear. The two mesh pockets on the sides are very shallow, almost too shallow for anything other than a wallet and keys; here they could have easily been made deeper, similar to the 2 Day Assault. Both the color and overall profile make it very urban and fit well in all environments, from the office to travel without standing out among the crowd.\n\n75% of the backpack's contact area is primarily on the lower back. There is very little contact with the rest of the back when walking; it requires very careful adjustment to get more contact with the backpack in the upper part of the back, and it varies quite a bit depending on how much weight is in the backpack.\n\nThe load lifters on the straps are very welcome, as the backpack tends to pull and lean slightly backward if not tightened. Especially in the beginning, this was an awkward sensation and caused discomfort in the upper back and shoulders, but it has improved significantly after getting to know the adjustments better.\n\nThe length of the backpack is fine and very similar to a Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault with the back panel set in the middle position. I am 180 cm tall (5.9 feet), and both the harness and the length of the bag fit well.\n\nThe zippers are some of the most functional I've seen in a long time. There are small loops at all ends of the zippers, making it incredibly easy to zip. It's a very functional tri-zip backpack. The new zipper pulls are also super grippy; I wish more manufacturers used similar pulls.\n\nThe bag is relatively waterproof; for the most part, the rain sits directly on top of the fabric and slides off.\n\nThe non-elastic bottle pockets on the sides are effective; however, they lack the option to be tightened at the top, as bottles easily slide out when the bag is lying horizontally, for example, in the overhead compartment of a plane or train.\n\nThe divided laptop compartment is one of the best laptop compartments I have seen. If I were a university student needing to carry books, folders, a laptop, and possibly an iPad, I would not hesitate to choose the Catalyst 26 as one of the best options, despite room for improvement. Compared to the Urban Assault, which largely disappointed on all fronts, the Catalyst is light-years ahead in both ergonomics and internal organization.",

The new zipper pulls are also super grippy; I wish more manufacturers used similar pulls.\n\nThe bag is relatively waterproof; for the most part, the rain sits directly on top of the fabric and slides off.\n\nThe non-elastic bottle pockets on the sides are effective; however, they lack the option to be tightened at the top, as bottles easily slide out when the bag is lying horizontally, for example, in the overhead compartment of a plane or train.\n\nThe divided laptop compartment is one of the best laptop compartments I have seen. If I were a university student needing to carry books, folders, a laptop, and possibly an iPad, I would not hesitate to choose the Catalyst 26 as one of the best options, despite room for improvement. Compared to the Urban Assault, which largely disappointed on all fronts, the Catalyst is light-years ahead in both ergonomics and internal organization.",

Realized I didn’t really need the water bottle pockets (although they are excellent), and found I much prefer the functionality and look of the front dump pocket.\n\nUPDATE: Here are photos in less direct light. Pretty cool how different it can look. I like everything about it much more than I expected.

Super easy to rip the top open and center zip makes it easy to quickly get to bottom of bag without guessing which side my ish is hiding. Comfy but maybe not as life changing some claim about MR harnesses.  And MR’s 500d coyote looks fantastic.\n\nLOADOUT\n\nMain pocket:\n- 14” laptop\n- 1” file folder\n- Evergoods cap2l\n- Small tool pouch\n- A5 notebook\n- Camelbak chute mag 750ml\n\nQuick access pocket\n- Work phone\n- Key bundle\n- Earbuds\n- Compact tissue pack\n\nInner pockets:\n- Alcohol wipes\n- Pocket notebook\n- Packable travel hand towel\n- Packable shopping bag\n- Protein bar\n- hand salve\n- lip balm\n\nLemme say it first, i freakin love the tri-zip! MR’s option of top access and center access just makes sense to me. I'm usually commuting in a tight subway or bus to surprisingly tighter confines of various coworking spaces, and being able to open or rather RIP OPEN the top is really handy and kinda fun. Nevermind, the triangular wedge shape just lends itself to this design and method: genius.\n\nAnd if i wanna find something in the bottom, the center zip lets me get to either side of the bag, while keeping other items above from spilling out. With a clamshell, i’d have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct side the item in question decided to hide and most times i chose poorly.\n\nMy only real prob is the lack of a place to put my pen or sharpie. But i made due by just clipping them to the end of the laptop strap, wrapping the velcro around them, and letting them dangle in the bag. Actually been kinda helpful, cause i can just tug on the strap and quickly fish out the pen from the bag.\n\nDo i need an outer water bottle pocket? Not really. Grabbing it either top side or from the center zip has worked fine for me. And id rather keep it hidden away from random subway drips, random coughs, and whatever else the city wants to randomly dribble on it.\n\nIn conclusion, does it remind me of the flux capacitor? Yes.",

And MR’s 500d coyote looks fantastic.\n\nLOADOUT\n\nMain pocket:\n- 14” laptop\n- 1” file folder\n- Evergoods cap2l\n- Small tool pouch\n- A5 notebook\n- Camelbak chute mag 750ml\n\nQuick access pocket\n- Work phone\n- Key bundle\n- Earbuds\n- Compact tissue pack\n\nInner pockets:\n- Alcohol wipes\n- Pocket notebook\n- Packable travel hand towel\n- Packable shopping bag\n- Protein bar\n- hand salve\n- lip balm\n\nLemme say it first, i freakin love the tri-zip! MR’s option of top access and center access just makes sense to me. I'm usually commuting in a tight subway or bus to surprisingly tighter confines of various coworking spaces, and being able to open or rather RIP OPEN the top is really handy and kinda fun. Nevermind, the triangular wedge shape just lends itself to this design and method: genius.\n\nAnd if i wanna find something in the bottom, the center zip lets me get to either side of the bag, while keeping other items above from spilling out. With a clamshell, i’d have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct side the item in question decided to hide and most times i chose poorly.\n\nMy only real prob is the lack of a place to put my pen or sharpie. But i made due by just clipping them to the end of the laptop strap, wrapping the velcro around them, and letting them dangle in the bag. Actually been kinda helpful, cause i can just tug on the strap and quickly fish out the pen from the bag.\n\nDo i need an outer water bottle pocket? Not really. Grabbing it either top side or from the center zip has worked fine for me. And id rather keep it hidden away from random subway drips, random coughs, and whatever else the city wants to randomly dribble on it.\n\nIn conclusion, does it remind me of the flux capacitor? Yes.",

Most days what I'll be carrying is a small fanny pack (mystery ranch in the lizard color way), book, water bottle, thermos, pistol, and a rain jacket. Maybe more on some days, maybe less. \n\nI was also looking at the rip ruck but I think the urban assault gives you much of the same quick access feature while also incorporating a vertical zip. \n\nAny input is greatly appreciated! \n\nAs a side note the 21L in Lizard would match the Fanny pack I already have from MR. 😂",

You place a botte inside and actually its the same than putting it inside the backpack. Also it looks a bit weird to me. The bottle will get pressed inside and not stick out a lot. So if you place something more bulky inside the UA24 you will have problems putting a bottle inside.",

            "body": "**Materials and overall look**\n\nFor a while I've been a proud owner of Mystery Ranch's Urban Assault 21, which is a highly recommended bag on this subreddit. The colorway is called Wood Waxed, which is soft to the touch and has an unassuming rustic look. According to Mystery Ranch on their website, the Wood Waxed UA21's material is a \"polyester blend with a Polyurethane based coating on it.\" It certainly feels much like a waxed canvas bag and scratching it will leave little white marks on the material, so it develops a patina with everyday use. The material feels quite pleasant to interact with actually and oddly reminds me of velvet.\n\n**Organization and tri-zip design**\n\nI purchased the bag because I sometimes take weekend getaway trips with my wife and my other smaller backpacks don't cut it when I need to bring a change of clothes, toiletries and some other stuff with me. The UA21 comes with a solid harness system and Mystery Ranch's intuitive tri-zip design which allows me to open up the whole main compartment. This makes the bag easy to pack without leaving any empty space between items. However, I've been using it as an everyday bag as well to experience how it wears and breaks in. It has served me really well as an EDC bag and despite its simple-looking exterior, it offers some solid organization. When I use the UA21 as an EDC bag, I usually just open the top flap to access the main compartment, but the tri-zip design has turned out to be really useful when I get some groceries for example. Then I can just lay the bag down on its back, open it up completely and fill it up quickly yet carefully without randomly having to throw everything in there through the top opening.\n\nI really like the cavernous pocket in the top flap of this bag where I can keep essential items, like a little knife, multitool, flashlight, lighter, mask, etc. It's very convenient to just put the bag down, open the top flap's zippered pocket and get whatever small item I might need. There are also two small mesh-lined internal pockets on both sides of the bag, near the top. I've been keeping my laptop's charger and cables in one of them. Really nice to have a specific and easily accessible internal pocket for my charger.\n\n**Water-resistance and zippers**\n\nMy UA21 was put through a serious rain test last night when I was outside for over an hour while it poured, and the little top pocket (or lid pocket as Mystery Ranch calls it) stayed completely dry inside.\n\nIt helps that all of the UA21's zippers are coated and very water-resistant. The main compartment's zippers are actually quite stiff so opening it up takes a bit of force. I actually have two minor criticisms and one has to do with the zippers. I don't mind the stiffness of the zippers, because they are chunky and coated, and even add a sense of security, but the zippers tend to get stuck in a few specific spots that have some webbing inside just near the zippers, especially when I unzip the main compartment slowly. The top lid's little pocket opens up really easily and nicely though.\n\n**Laptop sleeve**\n\nThe UA21 also has both a laptop and tablet sleeve. I quite like having two separate sleeves because the smaller one works well for my Kindle or especially my [flat essentials pouch](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/q8n8yn/tom_bihns_double_organizer_pouch_is_my_absolute/). While those sleeves are suspended, promising some protection if I were to accidentally drop the bag, my second small criticism is the lack of bottom padding. There is none, in fact. Maybe I'm just used to having bags that have decent bottom padding, but I definitely had to remind myself to put the bag down carefully today because I had a glass item inside. Also I always carry a chunky power bank which is at the very bottom of the bag and it definitely will take a beating if I throw the bag around.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nWhat I really love about the UA21 is the comfort. The bag's narrow and tall profile seemed a bit unusual to me at first, but since I'm a tall guy, its peculiar shape really fits my body well. The straps and back panel are just super comfortable and the weight distribution is excellent because I keep many items in the small pockets in the top part of the bag. I carried a lot of tech stuff today and the bag felt really light to wear. The UA21 has made me realise that a 6'22'' person like myself really benefits from having an EDC bag that is over 20 inches long.\n\n**Consensus**\n\nOverall I really love this bag, and it's certainly the type of bag that will last a long time. Although I initially purchased the bag for weekend trips, I'm happily using it as an EDC bag now. If you have any questions about it, feel free to ask. I definitely didn't talk about some additional features, like MOLLE webbing on the bottom, and the removable sternum strap, but I reviewed every part of the bag that I've been interacting with a lot.",

This does great for now - especially since I started relying on dedicated organization pouches and such rather than using pockets and pouches integrated into packs. I've found that makes it way easier to access things and swap items out if my needs change.\n\nAs for caribiners, I actually do have a Nite-Ize S-Biner on the tab on each of the laptop pocket zip. They work well for adding a water bottle if needed because (as you surely know) the external pockets are super tight when packed out. I do keep a slim water bottle in the tall pocket inside, but sometimes I grab a second if I'll be out for a while. Sometimes I will also add the [CapSnap](https://www.dsptch.com/products/capsnap) for attaching a hat to the outside.\n\nIf I could change 2 things about this pack it would be:\n\n\\- Flat bottom so it would stand up on its own\n\n\\- Horseshoe zip for the lid pocket, similar to what's on the 1-Day Assault Pack. I love the pocket on that, but the pack is a little too small overall for my EDC loadout.",

I put my hair dryer and portable bidet in the inner ones, water bottle and jacket/umbrella in the outer ones.

I have the 21L in the same color and it's much more comfortable because it doesn't have the laptop area so it sits closer to the back.

Or you could just pull open one lid zipper to gain access to either one zippered mesh pockets near the top sides. \n\nAlternatively, only pull down the center zip if you want something in the middle or bottom, if you swing the bag around on one shoulder to the front, you can use the center opening like a quick side access pocket, like on bags with front slash pockets (Evergoods CPL etc). But in reality, due to the long bag length, on body access can be difficult with tri-zip on some larger bags, so you'd better off putting the bag down.\n\nThe only time I'd see opening all 3 zippers is to fillet it for packing, not so much used on the go. As long as you lean it against something (so items at the top don't spill out), opening all 3 zips will also take up less real estate than a clamshell or horseshoe loader would since you'd have to lay the flap down, so this works nicely in tight spaces should you ever need to open the bag really wide to find something.",

They were giving breadcrumbs of details for a few weeks and the full design article was up almost a week before the drop. While there wasn't the option to get reviews ahead of time the fact that this was a v2.0 made it so there were few questions that went unanswered.\n\nI did end up picking up one in olive as it hits so many of the check marks I had been looking for. I don't know that I will be any more or less satisfied with this than any of the other 5 bags I have tried out and ended up returning over the last several months. All of the bags I have tried and returned were industry standards that had been out with several reviews and tons of information available on.\n\nOf course the biggest difference here is that I don't have the option to return the bag if I don't like it. If that happens then I am prepared to take a loss on the secondary market. Hopefully if I make that determination quickly enough there will still be people in markets that didn't have access that will be interested in a fair sale.\n\nI do appreciate all the commentary here though. It allowed me to be more prepared for what to expect and to temper my hopes.\n\nFor me the bottom line is that I am a picky SOB, so I appreciate this type of release as it gives this nexus of options that you wouldn't normally see in a single pack.

After a bit of planning, I bought another in \"shadow 1000d\" and set about modifying it.\n\nI added two compression straps with hefty ITW buckles  as well as two daisy chains. The straps can be run through the daisies to keep them in place or outside of them for bulkier items. The nature of the trizip design meant adding these features was relatively easy, as the interior of the bag is easily accessible. That being said, it was still a major pain to bartack the top of each daisy, as there are interior pockets blocking easy access. I got it done but not as cleanly as I'd like.\n\nI also added a 1\" belt for stabilization when skiing, and removed the internal laptop sleeve entirely. For hydration I sewed a snap hook to the interior strap (meant to retain a laptop in the sleeve) and plan to cut a hydration port in the user side of the back panel. \n\nI love the materials and workmanship of this pack- the 1000d material is beefy and the color matches with wolf grey webbing I found. I got the pack for $100 and spent an additional $15 on materials so I'd call it a good deal. Took it out for a ski tour this weekend and it worked great. \n\nI kinda wish MR would release outdoor packs more akin to their old Sweetpea- rugged fabrics, decent compression, and that wonderful trizip design. Most of their current offerings leave me cold in one way or another. \n\nAnyway, I had fun with this and look forward to using it for a long time.",

        "selftext": "Hello to my first-ever post!   \nI want to share my packing plan and gear comparison for my upcoming trip (I'm between jobs :D ).  \nI'll be traveling for 2.5 weeks, starting in Berlin and heading through the south of Germany, the Netherlands (just to pick up a buddy), Ireland, and Scotland. \n\nThis journey presents a unique packing challenge due to the different weather conditions I'll encounter, from the summer heat in Germany to the wet and cool climates of Ireland and Scotland. Additionally, I'll be flying with low-cost airlines, and I'm curious to attempt to pass any of these bags as a personal item.  \nIn Ireland and Scotland, I'm planning to rent a car to explore some intense hikes!  \n  \nLet's dive into my packing strategy and compare the Mystery Ranch Catalyst 26L and the Evergoods CTB 26L!\n\n**The Packing Challenge:** The diverse climates I'll face mean I need to pack smartly for both warm and wet weather. My goal is to stay comfortable and prepared without overpacking. Additionally, I need to ensure my backpack can pass as a personal item on low-cost airlines. Here's what I'm bringing, along with the reasoning behind each item to avoid unnecessary noise in my luggage.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n7011nogr39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d8cd12fe22db7e584763fc6b418e7ff40d96e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9co95qogr39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31f7d1ca01aa3c995140e6b37648d6366b8d8046\n\n**What I'm bringing:**   \n\n\n* **Clothing:** Versatile, quick-drying, and layerable items.\n   * 1x Peak Design M packing cube\n   * 1x Thule S packing cube\n   * 1x \\[Peak Performance commuter pants\\](https://www.bergfreunde.de/peak-performance-commuter-pants-trekkinghose)\n   * 1x \\[Lululemon hybrid shorts\\](https://www.lululemon.de/de-de/p/hybride-pool-shorts-18%C2%A0cm/151651557.html)\n   * 1x Wrangler hiking shorts \\_(can't find any link; I got them on a sale)\\_\n   * 2x \\[decathlon merino wool t-shirts\\](https://www.decathlon.de/p/merinoshirt-herren-kurzarm-backpacking-travel-100-braun/\\_/R-p-106265)\n   * 1x \\[smartwool merino t-shirt\\](https://www.globetrotter.de/smartwool-funktionsshirt-herren-m-perfect-crew-tee-almond-1269837)\n   * 2x Patagonia t-shirts \\_(the 50/50 cotton&amp;polyester ones)\n   * 1 \\[lululemon relax shirt\\](https://www.lululemon.de/de-de/p/kurzaermeliges-hemd-im-relaxed-fit/148225923.html)\n   * 4x \\[uniqlo airism underwear\\](https://www.uniqlo.com/de/de/product/nahtlose-airism-unterhose-464319COL09SMA007000.html)\n   * 3x \\[merino wool socks\\](https://www.bergfreunde.de/heber-peak-merino-sylvahe-crew-2-pack-multifunktionssocken/)\n   * 2x \\[uniqlo supima socks\\](https://www.uniqlo.com/de/de/product/socken-3-paar-464375COL09WSU024000.html)\n   * 1x \\[Patagonia puff jacket\\](https://eu.patagonia.com/de/de/product/mens-nano-puff-jacket/84212.html)\n   * 1x \\[Patagonia Calcite Jacket\\](https://www.alpinstore.com/de/546103-patagonia-calcite-goretexjacke-fr-mnner.html?ads\\_affilie=57&amp;id\\_contry=1&amp;id\\_devise=1)\n* **Footwear:** \n   * 1x \\[Hoka kaha 2 low\\](https://www.hoka.com/de/de/herren-berge/kaha-2-low-gore-tex/195719211455.html)\n   * 1x flip-flops for the hostel :D\n* **Toiletries:** Minimalist essentials.

Here's how I managed to fit everything, including a satisfying fit of the Evergoods 1L pouch into the laptop compartment. This bag offers a great layout, but let's see how it compares to the Evergoods CTB 26L. One of my concerns is whether it can pass as a personal item on low-cost airlines because it looks very packed and could pull attention.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ga62b1zes39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c64590c6898caad175a449b8d0ffc41715505e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygqke1zes39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46f65f7a7dd2ec45b1fdcb15e32510949985ad04\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhrf82zes39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43e2814299c668fb1afac48f65edad0b8c8e1b17\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63w704zes39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50cddf8e758506de72fef2a3fd788791fbe61d2f\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzwo6sivr39d1.jpg?width=3656&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4891bfd3b970a79b715b31308298546ad5078be\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8j934ims39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b53ea3aab007a2aee3dcd5b629f360482172f81\n\n**Packing the Evergoods CTB 26L:**\n\nNext, I packed the Evergoods CTB 26L. This bag surprised me with its spaciousness and organization. Everything fit comfortably, and it looked less packed overall, making it easier to manage the amount of stuff I brought along. I'm hopeful that this bag will be accepted as a personal item on my flights.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cetf6ooqs39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24830b47ef0dfb86cf89460e9cc67e61c06b89bd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6l9bdooqs39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92347047a1dd9d7910d4534386b649f413098676\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adjdiooqs39d1.jpg?width=4284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d582b38455cd258276e8a5ad94d2af398a29575\n\n**My Final Decision:** After comparing both bags, I've decided to go with the Evergoods CTB 26L for this trip. The main reasons are:\n\n* It looks less packed and feels more organized.\n* Easier to pack and access items.\n* Better overall fit for the amount of stuff I need to bring.\n* Confidence that it can pass as a personal item on low-cost airlines.\n\n**Conclusion:** I'm eagerly awaiting my trip and testing the Evergoods CTB 26L in real-world conditions. I'll be sure to update with how well it performs on the road and in the air. Plus, I'll share my experiences exploring the natural parks in Ireland and Scotland with my rented car.

Love the aesthetically pleasing looks, sturdy build quality, uniqueness, streamline sleek design while it also mqnqges to maintains that rustic traditional waxed canvas vibe.\n\nFor anyone on the fence regarding which color to buy, the Waxed Wood version here changes dramatically depending on the lighting. Sometimes it has a hardcore green hue to the bag giving it a very military esque look whilst other times it looks almost stonewash grey. Though, the zippers remain a very caramel brown regardless of its exposure.\n\nI don't believe it to actually be canvas, still Cordura. However, it definitely has a waxed finish giving it incredible wear with each scratch. Hope that helped you make your decision!",

                "body": "The design intent (from what I gather being a pack nerd, not trying to sound authoritative) is so that you can access the full contents of your load at any time. In a traditional top loader you'd have to unload the upper contents to get to the bottom. With this, you can either splay it open entirely, or, unzip the main body zip and grab the bottom. \n\nIt's also great to simply \"rip\" the top of the pack as a means of quick-access. Mostly, it makes packing super easy when compared to a normal top loader. I've found I'm able to fit a lot more into these since the separate panels can flex as they need to instead of the front being a large, complete piece. This also reduces a lot of stress off of the zippers.",
