        "selftext": "A recent work trip with a lot of my work stuff in a messenger bag left me pretty beat up, so I decided to get a better work/travel bag.  I have a fairly big, heavy laptop, 17\" diagonal and about 5.6 lb, the charger and some other tech stuff, probably a couple notebooks, and on days when I go into the office, maybe a textbook, maybe an extra layer, maybe my lunch.  I go between a few buildings when I go in so it's hard for me to just not take things.  My test load in my messenger is 21 lb.\n\nI took delivery of the 2DAP several days ago and I'm impressed by how well it wears with all that stuff in it.  I also like the color.  I'm not really sold on the 3 zip though and it's annoying that most of the pockets are internal.  Side bonus, it goes on a wheeled suitcase nicely.\n\nI got the Blitz yesterday.  On trying it with my test load, it really doesn't feel as stable.  I played with the compression straps and I guess they helped a little?  But I like that the whole front panel un zips and that there are a bunch of pockets on it, including one with pen slots.  So I want to like it better.\n\nComparing them side by side, they have almost the same frame.  The one on the 2DAP is about an inch taller, and the load lifter straps are correspondingly higher.  Is that enough to matter?\n\nIt's interesting to me that the deep interior pockets are on the inside face of the front panel on the 2DAP and in the side panels in the Blitz.  I threw my charger in one of those.\n\nOtherwise - the width and depth of the main compartments are within a fraction of an inch.  The girths are pretty much the same.  I took the side-by-side and luggage pictures with a pillow in each.  The other pictures are with my test load.\n\nAnyone else able to compare?  Anyone have some tricks for getting the Blitz to better control a compact, heavy load?",

I have a fairly big, heavy laptop, 17\" diagonal and about 5.6 lb, the charger and some other tech stuff, probably a couple notebooks, and on days when I go into the office, maybe a textbook, maybe an extra layer, maybe my lunch.  I go between a few buildings when I go in so it's hard for me to just not take things.  My test load in my messenger is 21 lb.\n\nI took delivery of the 2DAP several days ago and I'm impressed by how well it wears with all that stuff in it.  I also like the color.  I'm not really sold on the 3 zip though and it's annoying that most of the pockets are internal.  Side bonus, it goes on a wheeled suitcase nicely.\n\nI got the Blitz yesterday.  On trying it with my test load, it really doesn't feel as stable.  I played with the compression straps and I guess they helped a little?  But I like that the whole front panel un zips and that there are a bunch of pockets on it, including one with pen slots.  So I want to like it better.\n\nComparing them side by side, they have almost the same frame.  The one on the 2DAP is about an inch taller, and the load lifter straps are correspondingly higher.  Is that enough to matter?\n\nIt's interesting to me that the deep interior pockets are on the inside face of the front panel on the 2DAP and in the side panels in the Blitz.  I threw my charger in one of those.\n\nOtherwise - the width and depth of the main compartments are within a fraction of an inch.  The girths are pretty much the same.  I took the side-by-side and luggage pictures with a pillow in each.  The other pictures are with my test load.\n\nAnyone else able to compare?  Anyone have some tricks for getting the Blitz to better control a compact, heavy load?",

        "selftext": "Recently I bought 2DAP Forest and haven't exactly liked it, so I ordered second 2DAP (Foliage) with intention to compare colors and keep the better one. I noticed that either MR colors must've changed over the years, or the colors in photos used by retailers are very deceiving. \n\nForest one was manufactured in October 2021, Foliage in November of the same year.\n\nI still wonder which to keep since Foliage color is much ligher than I expected (especially molle straps) and seems to not match my multicam, flecktarn and WZ.93 camos at all. On the other hand, Forest color isn't very versatile and have some black elements which I dislike. \n\nDo you think Coyote is worth a try? Photos on the internet differ a lot, on some pack looks like mild brown-green color, on others like it's almost yellow. (I can still return both backpacks just in case, my country impose good customer service on retailers). Will Coyote be closer to RAL 7013? (the ideal tactical color imo)\n\nI know that might seem to be a very petty issue, but I'm a goddamn perfectionist.\nI'll be very thankful for every advice and some real photos of MR packs in Coyote color manufactured recently.",

        "selftext": "Thanks to everyone who gave me feedback in my threads.  I ended up choosing the Mystery Ranch 2 Day Assault Pack.  It fits a 17\" laptop, miscellaneous tech stuff, a couple notebooks, a text book, an extra layer, and my lunch really easily.  It also carries really well.  I found a funny little gusset in the lower corner that's not there in the Blitz, maybe that's what's going on?   I almost want to hike with this bag even though I have a couple great outdoor packs.  (That are weird with things like my laptop and notebooks.)\n\nThe tri zip is weird but it's growing on me: I can leave the bag on the floor propped up on my desk and partially unzipped and it doesn't get all over the place.  Having a top flap that tends to fall closed has also not ended up being a big deal in practice.\n\nThe lack of outside pockets is moderately weird but the inside mesh pockets near the top work fine for most of my small stuff and I can tuck my pencil in the PALS webbing.",

(That are weird with things like my laptop and notebooks.)\n\nThe tri zip is weird but it's growing on me: I can leave the bag on the floor propped up on my desk and partially unzipped and it doesn't get all over the place.  Having a top flap that tends to fall closed has also not ended up being a big deal in practice.\n\nThe lack of outside pockets is moderately weird but the inside mesh pockets near the top work fine for most of my small stuff and I can tuck my pencil in the PALS webbing.",

I fucking love it - it looks pretty big for a school/work bag (at least, on a short person), but I love that I can fit a jacket and a mini cooler with my lunch so I don't need to eat out. It works well for long days out of the house and even as a small weekend bag.\n\n  \nThe organization system is very different from a typical panel loading backpack, but it's very well thought out - you get used to it. The laptop sleeve is amazing - you can also hang a bladder in there and route the hose out through the external laptop access zipper.",

Your sleep system (assume that's what's strapped to the bottom) also looks big.\n\nAssuming you want to be able to cover distance, check out some of the thru-hiker and backpacking forums, or look at companies like Gossamer Gear for thoughts on how to make your camping setup lighter. Every oz. you take off your back is either more distance you can cover, more endurance you create, or more ability to carry food/ammo/Little Debbie snack cakes (go zebra cakes or go home).\n\nI also like a hydration bladder and it looks like you don't have one and only the throwaway bottle of water so might be something to consider.",

I won't be immediately running it as a bug out bag, but I would like it to have the capability of being ran as one nonetheless.\n\nCurrently I can get the MR 2DAP which comes in at 27 liters of space for $150 usd, and the Oakley KS which comes in at 34 litres for $120 usd.\n\nI've heard fantastic things about Mystery Ranch and the Oakley KS is very popular in reviews as well. I don't want to stand out too much in public and am slightly worried about the size of the KS. I am 5' 8\" with an athletic build, and I don't want to be dwarfed by a huge backpack that weighs a ton without anything even in it. The KS has more specific purposes compartments (hard shell on top, pouches with rigid and non-removable containers) whereas the MR 2DAP has a more open and do what you want interior. \n\nI want to know people's thoughts/experiences/insights about these options. Also, if you have any other suggestions I'm all ears.",

I won't be immediately running it as a bug out bag, but I would like it to have the capability of being ran as one nonetheless.\n\nCurrently I can get the MR 2DAP which comes in at 27 liters of space for $150 usd, and the Oakley KS which comes in at 34 litres for $120 usd.\n\nI've heard fantastic things about Mystery Ranch and the Oakley KS is very popular in reviews as well. I don't want to stand out too much in public and am slightly worried about the size of the KS. I am 5' 8\" with an athletic build, and I don't want to be dwarfed by a huge backpack that weighs a ton without anything even in it. The KS has more specific purposes compartments (hard shell on top, pouches with rigid and non-removable containers) whereas the MR 2DAP has a more open and do what you want interior. \n\nI want to know people's thoughts/experiences/insights about these options. Also, if you have any other suggestions I'm all ears.",

It’s an okay bag. I feel like mystery ranch offers better packs suited for tactical shit that can fulfill the needs within the 24-48 hour range, but that is just personal preference based on the lack of internal organization. If you want an affordable medium ruck sack-like bag with an awesome internal frame for carrying heavy or bulky loads, the two day is a great choice.\n\nI just find it an awkward bag in between sizes, a bit too small to be a rucksack-style bag with too large of a main compartment to be a 24-hour bag when needed. The internal tubes and quick-access pockets are awkwardly placed, so if you use them and don't run the bag fully packed in the main compartment, the bag tends to sag in on itself (for stuff like magazines, ammo, food, water, etc.). This is primarily a non-issue for most use but tends to feel weird while running with it on as it will bounce a bit with heavier stuff in the pockets. One way to resolve this is to throw everything in the main pocket, but then it's not as quick and a bit of a pain to grab you need to grab quickly.\n\nThat said, for 100 dollars (and not the 200 retail), it’s a great way to get into Mystery Ranch and see what you like. Despite its smaller size, the internal frame alone makes it a great bag, even better given the quality of the materials. However, given the trizip design at a smaller size, it does have its limitations.",

I could do without all the webbing stitches around the bag, but I still really dig it.\n\nHere are all the changes I noticed:\n-No adjustable yoke\n-stretch bottle pockets that are angled and come up a bit higher\n-interior organization similar to the new catalyst 26\n-no waist belt\n-no compression straps\n-looks like the same material used in the catalyst line\n-says 27 liters, but I recon it’s slightly smaller than the “27L” 2DAP\n\nCurious to hear people’s opinions on it!",

Was full price so I figured I'd look it up later and maybe wait for a deal. Now I'm looking online and can't find it on MR or any retailers sites. \n\nThere's one on eBay and some merari site but I prefer a true new when I can find one.",

Just got it yesterday so it’s very much preliminary impressions:\n\n-\tFeels sturdier than any other bag I own\n-\tRelatively heavy compared to my usual daily (Burton Kilo 1.0)\n-\tDoes feel lighter when worn rather than hand carried; so they built the frame very well to distribute the weight.\n-\tWish it had a proper laptop sleeve\n-\tWish it had one small zippered/organizational pocket outside in the front\n-\tQuite a unique layout/structure, so I’m curious to see if I can make it work for me",
