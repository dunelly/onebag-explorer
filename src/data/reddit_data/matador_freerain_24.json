            "body": "***Preface***: this isn't a review, rather observations ive made comparing these 5 packable day bags in my quest to finding the right one for this next chapter of my travels. \n\n***Context***: I returned from 6 months in Latin America using a Matador free rain 22- it was outstanding when needed, however I didn't use it much over the 6 months and have been seeking a bag that fits these criteria: \n\n\\-Comfortable\n\n\\-Packable (smaller than the Free rain- bonus if it packs in its on pocket w/o needing an external bag like matador) \n\n\\-Water resistant/water proof\n\n\\-Durable\n\n*Anyway,My thoughts..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Matador Freerain22**\n\nIll start here since this is where im comparing what I've learned from using this bag. Its a fantastic back that is highly capable, incredibly durable, weather resistant, comfortable and packs down. The outer water bottle sleeves fit my 32oz Nalgene. It's come with me hiking volcanoes overnight in Guatemala, evening rainy walks in Costa Rica, and living in the amazon for a month where I was exposed to heavy downpours. I love this bag, however over 6 months of travel, I used it far less than I thought I would, and as I prepare for another 6-12 months in Latin America, id love something that takes up less of a footprint in my bag. And even a bigger bonus, something I can store in the pocket of my rain jacket or belt bag to deploy if/when needed. On my scale the bag weighs: 295g\n\n**Matador Freefly 16**\n\nThis bag is quite nice, there some things I really like compared to the freerain, however I could see other areas falling short. For reference, it weighs as much as the Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack (195g), and I would trust its water proofing abilities for what I would throw at it (being in the amazon, and being near waterfalls or on the boat while scuba diving) That said, the bag has the features I love about the Freerain; PU coated sealing zippers, the mesh straps, and more durable bag material ( compared to the osprey bags), while also packing smaller and having zipper access instead of roll-top which is easier/more accessible to use.. but.. theres some things going that im not crazy about. My 32oz Nalgene doesn't fit on the outer pockets unless really forced in there exposing the stitching, and the fact that I still need another sack to pack down the bag. Leading me to the Osprey bags. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack**\n\nI loved this bag when it first came in. It packs down into its own pocket, has a waterproof roll top, comfortable shoulder straps, fits my 32 oz Nalgene without forcing it in, and the pocket that the bag stuffs into is situation inside the waterproof compartment and can be used to put small necessities (chapstick, wallet, sunscreen etc.). I really dont have any complaints about this bag at all with the super limited time/use ive had with it so far. I still question how necessary the roll-top feature is in pack, however when I think on it more, while living in the amazon or being in very wet environments it was nice to have that peace of mind that it was never a concern on my mind. It packs smaller than the freerain, yet, for some reason I still want to bring my free rain lol, perhaps because I have it/cant return it, and the material is more durable of a rip stop and have no concern about any durability issues I may run into in the long run while abroad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Stuff Pack**\n\nAt first I wasn't a fan and thought it would be an instant return (compared to the other Osprey or freefly) given the lack of waterproofing on the zippers and pretty loose water bottle stretch pouch (whereas the other osprey has nylon straps to sinch down the bottle for added security). But I quite enjoy yet again having the zipper instead of the roll top. The bag is comfortable, packs down the lightest of the four mentioned thus far. the small accessory zipper separate from the man compartment zipper has enough room to fit quite a bit including a kindle oasis, wallet etc. \n\n*Honourable mention not pictured..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Day Pack** \n\nIm seriously impressed with how small it packs down, smaller than the palm of my hand and weighs around 85 grams. But its really a no frills type of bag which is why Ill be returning it after experiencing the Osprey and other Matador. The material feels nice for how thin it is. \n\nThat said, im still not sure which bag Ill be taking with me, I welcome any perspectives or opinions",

It packs smaller than the freerain, yet, for some reason I still want to bring my free rain lol, perhaps because I have it/cant return it, and the material is more durable of a rip stop and have no concern about any durability issues I may run into in the long run while abroad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Stuff Pack**\n\nAt first I wasn't a fan and thought it would be an instant return (compared to the other Osprey or freefly) given the lack of waterproofing on the zippers and pretty loose water bottle stretch pouch (whereas the other osprey has nylon straps to sinch down the bottle for added security). But I quite enjoy yet again having the zipper instead of the roll top. The bag is comfortable, packs down the lightest of the four mentioned thus far. the small accessory zipper separate from the man compartment zipper has enough room to fit quite a bit including a kindle oasis, wallet etc. \n\n*Honourable mention not pictured..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Day Pack** \n\nIm seriously impressed with how small it packs down, smaller than the palm of my hand and weighs around 85 grams. But its really a no frills type of bag which is why Ill be returning it after experiencing the Osprey and other Matador. The material feels nice for how thin it is. \n\nThat said, im still not sure which bag Ill be taking with me, I welcome any perspectives or opinions",

            "body": "***Preface***: this isn't a review, rather observations ive made comparing these 5 packable day bags in my quest to finding the right one for this next chapter of my travels. \n\n***Context***: I returned from 6 months in Latin America using a Matador free rain 22- it was outstanding when needed, however I didn't use it much over the 6 months and have been seeking a bag that fits these criteria: \n\n\\-Comfortable\n\n\\-Packable (smaller than the Free rain- bonus if it packs in its on pocket w/o needing an external bag like matador) \n\n\\-Water resistant/water proof\n\n\\-Durable\n\n*Anyway,My thoughts..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Matador Freerain22**\n\nIll start here since this is where im comparing what I've learned from using this bag. Its a fantastic back that is highly capable, incredibly durable, weather resistant, comfortable and packs down. The outer water bottle sleeves fit my 32oz Nalgene. It's come with me hiking volcanoes overnight in Guatemala, evening rainy walks in Costa Rica, and living in the amazon for a month where I was exposed to heavy downpours. I love this bag, however over 6 months of travel, I used it far less than I thought I would, and as I prepare for another 6-12 months in Latin America, id love something that takes up less of a footprint in my bag. And even a bigger bonus, something I can store in the pocket of my rain jacket or belt bag to deploy if/when needed. On my scale the bag weighs: 295g\n\n**Matador Freefly 16**\n\nThis bag is quite nice, there some things I really like compared to the freerain, however I could see other areas falling short. For reference, it weighs as much as the Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack (195g), and I would trust its water proofing abilities for what I would throw at it (being in the amazon, and being near waterfalls or on the boat while scuba diving) That said, the bag has the features I love about the Freerain; PU coated sealing zippers, the mesh straps, and more durable bag material ( compared to the osprey bags), while also packing smaller and having zipper access instead of roll-top which is easier/more accessible to use.. but.. theres some things going that im not crazy about. My 32oz Nalgene doesn't fit on the outer pockets unless really forced in there exposing the stitching, and the fact that I still need another sack to pack down the bag. Leading me to the Osprey bags. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack**\n\nI loved this bag when it first came in. It packs down into its own pocket, has a waterproof roll top, comfortable shoulder straps, fits my 32 oz Nalgene without forcing it in, and the pocket that the bag stuffs into is situation inside the waterproof compartment and can be used to put small necessities (chapstick, wallet, sunscreen etc.). I really dont have any complaints about this bag at all with the super limited time/use ive had with it so far. I still question how necessary the roll-top feature is in pack, however when I think on it more, while living in the amazon or being in very wet environments it was nice to have that peace of mind that it was never a concern on my mind. It packs smaller than the freerain, yet, for some reason I still want to bring my free rain lol, perhaps because I have it/cant return it, and the material is more durable of a rip stop and have no concern about any durability issues I may run into in the long run while abroad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Stuff Pack**\n\nAt first I wasn't a fan and thought it would be an instant return (compared to the other Osprey or freefly) given the lack of waterproofing on the zippers and pretty loose water bottle stretch pouch (whereas the other osprey has nylon straps to sinch down the bottle for added security). But I quite enjoy yet again having the zipper instead of the roll top.
