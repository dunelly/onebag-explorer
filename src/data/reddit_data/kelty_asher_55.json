Stupid shit like books, power banks, enormous 10L water filter bag and extra filters, just stuff I wouldn’t need. \n\nTurns out I have a 17.5” torso, and I was wearing a pack for someone who has a 21” torso. \n\nDefinitely find some place where you can see and wear the pack in person, even bring some gear for weight; kitty litter bags most outfitters use work, but isn’t realistic as far as weight distribution.",

Pinched nerve; I had the waist belt literally around the top sides of my asscheeks, it felt fine when I did a 100 mile portion of the AT the year before, but that was only 5 days of wearing it. \nAfter 3 weeks of wearing it for hours and miles every day, I knew I had a problem. \n\nI hobbled into the Bluff Mountain Outfitters in Hot Springs and the owner looked at me and said, “dude no wonder you’re limping, that pack is way too tall for you!” \n\nI had no idea what me meant, I never heard that before. \n\nHe measured me and gave me a custom fitted UL 35L pack and helped shave all the weight I was carrying. Stupid shit like books, power banks, enormous 10L water filter bag and extra filters, just stuff I wouldn’t need. \n\nTurns out I have a 17.5” torso, and I was wearing a pack for someone who has a 21” torso. \n\nDefinitely find some place where you can see and wear the pack in person, even bring some gear for weight; kitty litter bags most outfitters use work, but isn’t realistic as far as weight distribution.",

I'd like to prioritize weight and comfort over features at this point (though who doesn't like features, I'll always take some features).\n\nIt looks like the [Kelty Asher 35](https://www.kelty.com/asher-35/) was released relatively recently, which may explain its lack of reviews. I'm interested in hearing if anyone has used it yet, because I'm having some trouble believing these specifications:\n\n* 35l capacity\n* 800g weight\n* $99\n\nGenerally with any other pack I've seen in this range, one of those three things is lying. Either the capacity is lower (ULA Dragonfly), the weight is higher (Arcido, REI), or the price is higher (take your pick).\n\nI can't seem to find any local retailers that have it in stock, so wanted to check: have any of you used it? Is it accurate to the description? Is it comfortable?\n\nThanks for any help!",

Although the waist belt has wings, I wouldn’t expect to get real load bearing from it. \n\nFit is the go-no go parameter and you just have to try it on. If you are rather short or tall, I would be doubtful on fit.",

So assuming the hip belt, straps, and/or side pockets are flimsier on the Kelty, it could go either way.",

I one bagged with a redwing 32 and have very little complaint besides a useless waist strap. This appears to have the same set up. If you’re recovering from injury and need some plush support, might want to look elsewhere. \n\nSomething with a super sturdy hip belt might be better for you. Overall capacity is less important than where the weight rides in my experience. You can have a 45L pack with a hip belt that carries better than a 25L pack with a thin waist strap. \n\nCheck out the mystery ranch scree for a similar size bag with a great hip belt. Or to stay with kelty and a lower price, the redwing 44 has a pretty solid harness/hip belt system.",
