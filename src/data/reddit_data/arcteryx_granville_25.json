Top of the echelon workmanship and technology. \n\nI however did not purchase one because and my reason is also very relevant to the comments on here about this bag. \n\nWell, the reason is because it looked too sporty. I realize it's an outdoors mountaineering company and should obviously look the theme, I just thought it may look like a regular bag. \n\nI wanted to get it in Sand. \n\nTo end with how I started this, it's a stunning bag. Looks very robust. But I need the bag to look modern and upscale and have some organization.\n\nThe yellow posted here looks like a regular bag. Very cool color. I may have gotten it because it looks cool more than my beef l need for it. \n\nRegarding the back, it.makes.sense! It's a rock climbing bag, they've designed the rear to cling to you to reduce or eliminate any unsprung weight (the bag and it's contents).\nThe mesh I saw (bag model year 2024) wasn't very rough or abrasive but I can see it ruining a nice dress shirt made of cotton wool or linen. \nBut that's fine! It's supposed to be worn on rugged mountaineering attire. \nIt's like saying thy high-viz accents on urban running attire is not fashionable.",

I wanted something just big enough to fit my MacBook Air 13, Bose QC headphones, notepad, pen, a few snacks and a lightweight pullover. I'm tall and have big feet so I wanted something that left more room for me to extend my feet under the seat. This seemed like a good option and was on sale when I bought it. I really like it. Well made, light and not bulky at all. Very comfortable as well. The one criticism I've got so far is that the pocket on the front, the lower, horizontal one, should have the zipper going left to right, not right to left. When I have the bag on its side, the other front pocket (normally vertical) is now horizontal and easy to access, but now the zipper on the lower pocket opens from bottom to top. So you have to be careful nothing falls out if you open it. I'm working around this by not putting anything in the bottom pocket I might want on the plane. Certainly not a deal killer but something to be aware of. Otherwise, for the price I paid, it's an excellent bag.",

I wanted something just big enough to fit my MacBook Air 13, Bose QC headphones, notepad, pen, a few snacks and a lightweight pullover. I'm tall and have big feet so I wanted something that left more room for me to extend my feet under the seat. This seemed like a good option and was on sale when I bought it. I really like it. Well made, light and not bulky at all. Very comfortable as well. The one criticism I've got so far is that the pocket on the front, the lower, horizontal one, should have the zipper going left to right, not right to left. When I have the bag on its side, the other front pocket (normally vertical) is now horizontal and easy to access, but now the zipper on the lower pocket opens from bottom to top. So you have to be careful nothing falls out if you open it. I'm working around this by not putting anything in the bottom pocket I might want on the plane. Certainly not a deal killer but something to be aware of. Otherwise, for the price I paid, it's an excellent bag.",

I always found the color attractive but never picked anything up from that season. The color looks even better in person, it’s just beautiful. A deep, rich gold, like bourbon or honey. I’ve always been a fan of this rugged AC2 fabric but I’ve only had it in black or grey. Almost like a pearled paint job on a car, this pack isn’t just one color. It has a lustre that reveals different shades depending on the light and angle. This color really highlights the beautiful AC2 weave and the unique toughness of the material. \n\nThe way the material is utilized in this pack makes for a sleek and slim profile, albeit a little wide. I’m wide in the shoulders so this works for me, but the pack could look more bulky on someone with a smaller frame. \n\nI haven’t seen much written up about this pack, there seems to be more love for its little brother (Granville 16). \n\nA few notes: \n\nStraps are plenty comfortable, despite their skinny profile. \nThe buckle is great for one-handed opening, a little fiddly for one-handed closing. \nThe addition of the zipper beneath the flap is a nice update from the original buckle/magnet closure. It’s simple to use unzipped, but nice to have the security of zipping the main compartment fully closed below the top flap. \nIt feels a bit smaller than 20L, but the layout is nicely organized so most things are easy to access. \nThe top handle is nice and burly. All attachment points feel very solid. \n\nThe way my Arrakis 50 has withstood mountain abuse, I’m not worried about the longevity of this pack for travel and EDC/commuting. \nIf you’re curious about this pack, pick one up! It’s been very satisfying for my daily work stuff, plus a few extra things. I totally trust this material and design to keep my electronics safe and dry, and the pack just looks sexy as can be!",

This bag carries so well - super comfy and you can get through an airport super quick esp if you need to sprint for a gate. Slides under the seat perfectly. Never need a carry on bin. The clamshell shape fits way more than you think it ought to be able to. Laptop section is amazing with room for a laptop, iPad and cords. Interior organizer for passports etc is perfect. It was a big investment but has saved me tons in ditching the carry on bag and comfortably never needing an overhead bin. Best biz travel purchase ever. ",

This bag carries so well - super comfy and you can get through an airport super quick esp if you need to sprint for a gate. Slides under the seat perfectly. Never need a carry on bin. The clamshell shape fits way more than you think it ought to be able to. Laptop section is amazing with room for a laptop, iPad and cords. Interior organizer for passports etc is perfect. It was a big investment but has saved me tons in ditching the carry on bag and comfortably never needing an overhead bin. Best biz travel purchase ever. ",

            "body": "First impressions are extremely positive!  It really does have a Nomin-like feel to it and the immediate hyperbolic question that comes to mind is: Does the Granville Zip 16 make the Nomin obsolete given price/feature/design differences?  Obviously not completely...but it makes things much more interesting!\n\nQuick Notes:\n\n\\- The inner side of the backpack straps are the same material as what they've been using recently on their Brize and Bora packs (also likely the same that Alpha 31 uses).  Thickness of the foam is about on par with the Brize 25 (which I like and is definitely more on the cushy side than normal packs)\n\n\\-I already like the pocket/organization more than the Nomin V2.  What's interesting and I'm not sure if it will add any value for me yet, is the fact that the pocket at the front/bottom space of the pack has zipper access from the front side and you can also access via zipper from the inside main section where the laptop is housed.\n\n\\-Seam sealing and overall construction is top notch, as expected from an Arc product.  Having an EDC that is nearly waterproof without need for rain cover etc. is one of my major selection points.\n\n\\-The bag itself feels a lot more like the Nomin V1 (but with a quick access pocket in the top front) more than it does the V2.\n\n\\-Pilot gray color with black accents looks sleek!\n\n\\-For around $200 shipped from Canada, I think this is going to win over a lot of people for their EDC\n\n\\-I haven't packed it up yet to see how it carries, so maybe all the excitement is for naught if it carries like shit...more to come!\n\nAdditional Insights:\n\n\\-Tried the pack on and it carries well.  Nomin V2 is more comfortable due to different/wider straps.  The straps are actually narrower than most other Arc'teryx bags in their mainline but still carries comfortably.  \n\n\\-Logo on the front is reflective and I'm not sure but I believe the zipper pulls are new.  I like them, they have design at the end of them to help easily catch your finger on them.  100% better than CPL 24 zipper pulls, probably slightly better grab and pull than Nomin's (though perhaps less stylish depending on what floats your boat).\n\n\\-Top grab handle is kind of a combination of Nomin V1 + V2 with slightly more foam to it, I like it a lot.  Much, much beefier than Arc'teryx Brize grab handle.\n\n\\-The fact that we are comparing this to the Nomin $225 vs. $800 retail says a lot.  In the end, the pocket design and organization , IMO, is better on this bag.  All the straps and materials used for laptop compartment are clearly superior on the Nomin.  The overall footprint/silhouette of this bag is probably 65% of the Nomin V2.\n\nMore Photos:\n\n[On Body](https://imgur.com/KkRaEQL)\n\n[Clean Front of Pack](https://imgur.com/JkllF2a)\n\n[Front Side Pocket with Tumi Cable Organizer Inside](https://imgur.com/KOsSkv7)\n\n[Right Side of Pack](https://imgur.com/d6B9VAe)\n\n[Left Side of Pack (Logo Reflective + New Zipper Pulls)](https://imgur.com/Sef6Pob)\n\n[Main Compartment w/Full Packing Cube at Bottom](https://imgur.com/H6Aaa29)\n\n[Straps/Inner Backside](https://imgur.com/2kiSZ2F)\n\n[Pockets Looking In from Front Side Pocket](https://imgur.com/WmdbXBg)\n\n[Top Front Quick Access Pocket w/Apple Pencil for Attempt at Depth Reference](https://imgur.com/C58JNS0)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: Added more pics and additional insights.

I have a DSPTCH bag with fidlock and I admit it is faster but it also has a zipper and while I'm sure nothing will fall out the less annoying is still some zipper opening (over unrolling).\n\nThat is the thing with a rolltop that is annoying is not the whole open rolltop aspect but rather the opening is at the top and often things are hard to get at the top particularly when you have loose fabric in your way. I suppose this cuts that in half but jam a bunch of layers of clothes in there and you have the same problem that you cannot access your laptop easily.\n\nIt is also notable on the DSPTCH bag I broke the fidlock by grabbing the bag at the top in the same manner that Kevin does in the video. See fidlock unlike a zipper or other attachments will not separate (a zipper can separate, velcro can unvelcro) without breakage. Luckily DSPTCH with their lifetime warranty fixed it.\n\nEven with all that said I like the bag and my biggest complaint is sadly the lack of some sort of exterior elastic (cough) water pocket.",
