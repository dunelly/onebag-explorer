Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

I'm really confused by the choices here.\n\nThe biggest differences I see between this an the Venture Ready non-travel is the water-resistant fabric, the gimmicky tote, additional increased dimensions (except the reduction in depth) and hidden water bottle container? I guess you could count the additional interior straps as a travel feature. But the bag only has a 6.1 inch depth, so is that really needed?\n\nDimensions measure 22 inches x 15.75 inches x 6.1, so it can't take advantage of the typical carry on sizes (22 in x 14 in x 9 in) offered by major airlines and it's too big for a personal item. Also the hidden water bottle eats into the main compartment? Worst of all the bag retains the thin shoulder straps with no added hip belt. As a traveler you'd want a quality carry system.\n\nAll for a total of $329, with no lifetime guarantee? Though, I'll admit it's a nice looking bag like all other Bellroy bags.",

But nothing wrong on this end, very usable day to day, durable and proved great for a weekend getaway. Some features may seem gimmicky but usable. I’ve used the zipper water bottle pocket - it’s great. Tote, used it, works, is actually a decent shape and clips on the front of bag, so don’t need to awkwardly hold in on shoulder with the pack.

            "body": "Was umming and ahhhing about this backpack but pulled the trigger, even though I was hesitant to spend that kind of money on a bag I hadn't seen in person.  Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

            "body": "Was umming and ahhhing about this backpack but pulled the trigger, even though I was hesitant to spend that kind of money on a bag I hadn't seen in person.  Although I do know someone with the Venture Pack (second edition) and liked what I saw.\n\nI did consider the Venture Pack (second edition) and it probably would have saved me about £90 but I really needed a zipped water bottle side pocket and figured that with the more rugged material plus the tote and hidden compartment, as well as the RFID pocket, it would be worth it.\n\nAfter spending a weekend with it, I am a fan of it, and kind of wished they'd given us more of a larger bag with the travel designation.  Maybe a 28L - 32L version would have been better.  After all, I could have gotten an AER Travel Pack in X-Pac for the same price, but I guess one saving grace is that the Bellboy Venture Travel pack can definitely be used as a daily EDC in my humble opinion.\n\nFirstly, Although I do like the face material, I still prefer the look of the Baida Nylon from the second edition, I think it just looks better.  With this pack, they've used the new material on the brain compartment and main front body which is more rugged feeling and wipes easier. The side panels are the Baida Nylon.  The bottom is the grid material from the first venture pack.\n\nLove the zipped water bottle pocket, can confirm it takes the 1L Nalgene no problem.  Will likely use a memo bottle A6 with it as a daily as the Nalgene eats into the main compartment, although if you're not fully packed out it should be fine.\n\nBrain compartment, very handy but wished it was bigger or wish they omitted the pen slots in favour of something bigger.\n\nOther side compartment can fit another bottle but wished they'd put some stretchy pockets in there too, would have been more useful than one cavernous space.  I used it for a smallish umbrella and it was perfect.\n\nStraps are comfy, no complaints, chest strap works and I like the magnetic closure. Not sure if the second edition had them but the looped grab handles for the straps is an excellent design choice\n\nTop handle is comfy, perfect size but placement means putting the main compartment zippers in the middle will get in the way of handle use.\n\nTote bag is good size and love that it clips onto the main bag if required.  Hidden compartment for the tote can also fit in a Peak Design packable tote as well fyi.\n\nOverall, very happy with purchase, definitely overpriced - would attract more buyers probably at something like £260-280, but lovely all round bag with useful organisation and comfy for all day use for travel and as daily.",

I'm really confused by the choices here.\n\nThe biggest differences I see between this an the Venture Ready non-travel is the water-resistant fabric, the gimmicky tote, additional increased dimensions (except the reduction in depth) and hidden water bottle container? I guess you could count the additional interior straps as a travel feature. But the bag only has a 6.1 inch depth, so is that really needed?\n\nDimensions measure 22 inches x 15.75 inches x 6.1, so it can't take advantage of the typical carry on sizes (22 in x 14 in x 9 in) offered by major airlines and it's too big for a personal item. Also the hidden water bottle eats into the main compartment? Worst of all the bag retains the thin shoulder straps with no added hip belt. As a traveler you'd want a quality carry system.\n\nAll for a total of $329, with no lifetime guarantee? Though, I'll admit it's a nice looking bag like all other Bellroy bags.",

Having it in hand, I can see it’s no worse than all the other backpacks I’ve had in the past.  I also can understand the hate for it - being way overpriced for its size. But nothing wrong on this end, very usable day to day, durable and proved great for a weekend getaway. Some features may seem gimmicky but usable. I’ve used the zipper water bottle pocket - it’s great. Tote, used it, works, is actually a decent shape and clips on the front of bag, so don’t need to awkwardly hold in on shoulder with the pack. Yes RFID is pointless. ",

I had also seen on an older post this 3D printed fix from [Octo Safety Devices](https://octosafety.com/products/strap-keeper-for-bellroy-backpacks) and it was relatively cheap (not cheap for piece of plastic but hey I don't have a 3d printer or any sort of design aptitude), so I took a shot.  The little part just snaps in each buckle and voila no more slipping.\n\nIts a nice city commute bag for when I need to carry more than my big slings, and has a nicer feel when carrying a laptop than either my lightweight packable Rennen Ripstop or the more robust CT21.  True to name, when fully expanded it does have bigger internal volume than the CT21.  The straps, being a bit more svelte, won't carry heavier weights as well as that CT21 or my Tenba DNA camera backpack, but thats fine. Its real trick is how small and thin it can get when empty, which is good for a crowded commute. \n\nFabric feels real nice, like most Bellroy bags.  They probably arent as tough or strong as cordura, but they feel more premium under hand and are tough enough for what I will use it for.  Layout is fairly clever, I actually like the large pocket on the \"lid\", useful for me.  The side pockets I don't really use, but its useful to throw an umbrella on one side and any drinks I pick up on the other, its nice I don't have to open up the bag to get to them.   I was also pleasantly surprised it is self standing.  I think I will keep it.  I like to have a little variety in my collection as long as there is not too much overlap, and its I have a roll top, half zip and a few panel loaders already, so a flap top rounds it out.",

Only wish it kept the water resistant material in the water bottle pocket like the Chimera.\n\nIMO, it's not as beautiful as the Apex but I feel like it's the perfect fusion of the Apex and PD backpack, and that works for me.\n\nWill prob be selling the Apex, will def be selling the Chimera.",

Can’t tell if there’s an external water bottle pocket, which seems like it’d be a good thing to have for a bag that ostensibly is about getting outside (which the if it’s aligned with the Venture attitude).

            "body": "Here's my initial review of the Bellroy Venture 2.5L vs Lite mini 4L: [Photos for comparison](https://imgur.com/a/ZRwA0dR)Edit: Added more photos.\n\nHere is my loadout, the main goal is to carry minimal gear + occasionally water bottle, for travel and EDC. I care more about functionality, and secondly aesthetics.\n\n* Phone\n* Wallet\n* 500ml/16oz water bottle\n* Passport\n* Earbuds\n* Room for other small items, lip balm hand sanitizer bottle etc\n\n**Similararities**\n\n* Both slings are able to fit the above, and are comfortable to carry.\n* Straps are almost identical, with possibly the lite mini with a slightly thinner strap\n* Both fit a switch with side controls on\n* Bellroy measures their width by the zipper, the actual dimensions are different than listed. Measurements below.\n\n**Venture 2.5L**\n\n* Measures (mm): Listed: 220x150x100 (real: 250x150x100). With the different design, the front pocket has its own depth now (unlike other ventures).\n* Fits all the gear well, but does become too bulky, brick-like. Against the body, it definitely sticks out too much. With a narrow water bottle, this will become less, but I still think the lite would look better\n* Surprisingly the front pocket is still very accessible, and I love the divider.\n* The rugged material of the venture means one-hand zipping is easy\n* For such a small bag, the zipper pulls do seem too big. Plus the exposed front zip means you can see all 3 zippers\n* I don't love the phone sleeve. It is a little loose and takes up a fair amount of space. A thinner one would work better. Also, it would be better if it was slightly raised for easier access\n* The sunglass pocket is a little flappy\n* The back pocket is great and fits your passport or phone (pixel 5)\n* No side gussets, and the zippers don't go as wide as the venture line. This makes access to the main compartment slightly harder\n* Overall, great organisation\n* Looks better when not overpacked\n\n**Lite Mini 4L**\n\n* Meausres (mm): Listed: 200x170x70 (real: 240x175x70)\n* Fits all the gear well, and still remains slim looking\n* Same typical front pocket, not the most usable with the main compartment stuffed. Can still be used for earbuds, lip balm\n* Its lacking organisation, and feels like it needs one more internal pocket for my needs. I may stitch on a mesh pocket as I've seen other redditers do\n* Love love love the gussets on the main compartment, this is probably the best feature\n* The small side pocket in the main compartment is pretty sleek, meaning that something in there could slide out the side gusset, in a not so typical scenario. The bag would have to be upside down, and shaken. I still wouldn't put something valuable in there like earbuds.\n\nNeither sling is perfect, I like the organisation on the venture 2.5L but overall the design of the Lite mini looks better IMO. If hardly carrying anything, the venture 2.5L looks better, but the Lite mini is more versatile and will look good in most situations.\n\nEdit: I have returned the venture 2.5L, and I'll be keeping the lite sling mini. Mainly because it holds a water bottle better.",

When filled out the bag does become a brick and is not comfortable to wear. I’m just going to rock my Venture 9L for my EDC, despite being much larger it is much more comfortable, holds all my EDC and I can fit a water bottle in it comfortably.
