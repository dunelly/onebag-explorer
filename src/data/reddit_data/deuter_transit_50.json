        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

        "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m deep into the one bag life at this point, but this is my first trip (so far) with the Osprey 26+6 and I wanted to tell y’all about it! Some preface: I don’t consider myself too much of a minimalist, but I am pretty frugal (went with this bag bc it was &lt;$100). We are traveling around Europe in April so lots of rain and colder weather. Trip length is about 3 weeks and is more hiking than cities. \n\nBrief packing list:\nCotton shirts x 2 for everyday\nPolyester shirts x 2 for athletics\nButton down shirt x 1 for nice occasions\nAthletic shorts x 2 too cold should’ve done sweats lol\nPants x 2 for everyday\nSweatshirt for everyday\n3 in 1 north face jacket\nQuechua 10l Day bag (lies flat in the laptop compartment)\nSanuks\nNike running shoes\n5 pairs of underwear and socks\n1 pair of long Johns (thermal underwear)\nA hat and a winter hat\n\nOther stuff:\nPhone + charger\nWorldwide adapter\nSunglasses\nPassport\nWallet\nCards\nPens\nLiquids (shampoo, conditioner, etc)\nToiletry bag (toothbrush, deodorant, brush, etc)\n\nOk! Let’s get into the bag now that we know what’s in it. First off, this thing is light. You can tell right away. When fully packed (about 10 pounds total) it still feels good, but it definitely pulls on your shoulders a little. In that sense I don’t think you can take it hiking or anything unless it was maybe packed out about half, but I don’t think that’s what you’re doing anyway. I bought it to use as a personal item and it seems to have accomplished that task nicely (flew Ryanair yesterday and they didn’t even check it). Compressed this thing is a brick. You can definitely feel the stress on the zippers but they’re SOLID which makes me feel good about it (shout out Osprey). Expanded the weight is a little more towards the outside but honestly not bad! Reviews told me it would be tough, but it’s comparable. Plus it still fits under the seat clearly. Probably not in the sizer though. \n\nThe back-panel is solid which is helpful for bulging and the water bottle pockets aren’t bad. They won’t hold a Nalgene but most others will do. I’ve used the shove it pocket for wet stuff and it’s great but could be stretchy and be amazing!\n\nI have a large and medium packing cube in the main bin with no problems (the compression strap is actually great!) this is all my clothing plus the Sanuks. Other side has the toiletry bag plus a small cube for underwear and socks. Middle flap has the liquids. Smaller stuff is shoved into the small pocket up top for ease of access. \n\nTLDR: great small bag. Solid build. Mostly comfortable. Good value. Features are awesome and not extraneous!",

Just think about it. \n- Nine tops seems like a lot for 5 days. Even if I don't count the linen top or sweatshirt as I suspect those are for layering, that is still seven tops. Even if you want to avoid laundry and don't rewear tops, six should be more than enough. \n- Four bottoms feels like a lot too, maybe cut down to three?\n\nAll that said, if it fits, you are happy with it, and can carry it all comfortably, I say go for it. You can always assess when you get back and consider whether you really needed that many of whichever items.",

I think the packable bag is a good idea, there’s loads to do in Amsterdam and you’ll likely find yourself with a few souvenirs. \n\nI don’t have much to contribute in terms of your packing list, but I wanted to add that we particularly enjoyed an open top canal trip at night, house of rituals (spa treatments were great), van gough museum and there’s a fantastic bakery called craft coffee &amp; pastry. \nHave a great trip!",

The framing is great, but different from the gravity system if you have used osprey before. I actually prefer the AirScape to the gravity. \n\nYou will overpack and break your knees if your not careful, I wanted the bigger pack for volume, not weight. Camera equipment, drone equipment and the power. Also a bigger tent that weighs as much as my small tent. However a couple of times I have packed wayy to much weight in, because I could.

As someone who has used a medkit and seen them used (usually while climbing, not hiking)... the first thing that happens when someone gets into a medkit they didn't themselves prepare is they turn it upside down and dump everything on the ground to find what they need IMMEDIATELY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI recommend the molle EMT first aid pouch designs, they come empty and have a bunch of elastic bands and a couple pouches to keep things tidy.  Then fill it with stuff you buy in \"bulk\", so that you can replenish the kit if you use it. I have mine set up a lot like the above poster used:\n\n 1.  I put small bandaids, tweezers, antiseptic, burn gel, alcohol pads, and bug sting relief (all these things you can get in disposable packets so you have spares to cycle in) in one ziploc, and some sets of gloves in another ziploc.  these are the only two things that aren't readily available because they're bagged.  I guess I do have an altoid tin with my single use meds too, basic pain meds, anti diarrhea, and allergy are all of them i think\n\n2.  The rest are sterile packed items out of \"bulk\" boxes.  4x4 gauze pads, rolled gauze, an ace wrap, abdominal pad or two, cloth tape, and a sheet of cheap walmart moleskin knockoff.  Bring LOTS of rolled gauze and 4x4's as they are light and the thing most commonly used.  Watch a video on how to make a large bandage with gauze and tape if you don't know how, practice so you can do it one handed.\n\nThere's lot of other stuff you can bring, but mostly I use gauze.  Bandaids, moleskin, and sting relief are next highest but for the most part are convenience items.  Ace bandage and burn gel has gotten a little use and I'm glad I've had it with me.  Most of the sterile bandages, pads, and packets are sold cheaply in packs of 20 to 100, put the overflow in a box in the closet so you can use them freely.  Side note: I was trained in EMS as a teenager so i also have a small pair of clothing scissors you see emt's use, it's not necessary but it's nice being able to cut things like the moleskin and bandages to size.  You might need to buy precut moleskin patches if you omit this, which most people probably would.\n\nIf you bother to bring a tourniquet, make sure you know how to use it, practice with it.  You can also buy a nice large piece of cloth used for making slings for an arm (also imperative you learn to sling an arm, and practice)... this sized cloth can be made into a tourniquet with a stick in a pinch.  Although I've never actually heard of someone having to do this... i know people feel better when they at least have the option, and a multipurpose sling cloth can be used for a number of different things as well as being super light.",

It just seems like it’s built more durably. Despite the smaller space than the Day Sling, another user on this subreddit pointed out that the zipper placement on the Day Sling is tough to work with and may actually make it have less usable size than the City Sling. And, this is a small gripe, but I don’t like the fact that the Day Sling has the old fashioned closure on the strap… Something about the snappiness of the magnet on the City Sling / Lite Sling, are nice. Now… for the Bellroy, I like it. I do. I like how compressible it is. I can fit my 32oz water bottle and carry that around all day. But it just feels big. Like really big in terms of surface area on your chest. But again, with the city sling, I have very few water bottles that’ll fit in that, aside from plastic bottles, just knowing the size. It can still carry the essentials though. Thoughts?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Brompton/comments/16td2xz/lumabag_rucksack_for_brompton_electric_review_and/",
        "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/5pg8ze0gkpqb1.jpg?width=3455&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31add55079ea7e140dd6f955139e1ea282ba185b\n\n**TL;DR:** It's very expensive at 349 Euro, but the [Lumabag Rucksack](https://lumabag.de/rucksack-brom-e-passend-fuer-das-brompton-electric/) immediately became my favorite bag for the Brompton Electric (they sell a non-electric version too).  It easily has the best carrying capacity of any current Brompton Electric bag, it's super nicely made, is cleverly designed, and it makes carrying the 5.4lb (2.4kg) battery way less of a burden.\n\n(You can save 45 Euro by ordering without the frame, which you probably already have if you've bought any of the other big electric bags. If you're in the US like me, you won't pay VAT, but shipping pretty much balances that out. In all, I paid $325 or about 308 Euro).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi19r454lpqb1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fac38c6c3b177d6b9f56e7dd8b2b50ce855e8e5d\n\n**More Thoughts:**\n\nI'm always looking for ways to carry more stuff on my bikes without having to attach my cargo trailer. As such, I owned the three available \"big\" bags for the Brompton Electric before buying the Lumabag.\n\n* I was disappointed with the official City Bag; I felt it carried too little for its size and weight. It's not bad if you get is as a freebie and can be nice if you just need to carry a laptop and the occasional extra, but I feel the design makes it awkward to carry groceries or other large loads.\n* The Valeria Bag has a lot of cargo space and is easily the lightest of the bags, but the material and frame are really thin, so it tended to bounce around and sag a lot with heavier loads (say, cartons of oat milk, for example). Crucially, I noticed this would sometimes block the headlight on rides, which made it a no-go for me. It's still a solid choice and I love the various designs, but I'd find some way to reinforce the bottom.\n* The Brough Basket is nice, and it's what I'd recommend to most Bromptons Electric owners who want an upgrade from the small bag. I have the bright night version and it looks quite nice too. It's versatile, light, and convenient without costing too much (it includes the frame), and I like the attachment points on the front. I appreciate that it can be partially closed off and made thinner with the straps on the side. It's also a little larger than the non-electric Borough bag, to compensate for the volume of the battery. But it wasn't greatly sealed against the elements, I missed having more pockets for trinkets, and it still felt a little awkward to carry.\n\nThen I learned about the Lumabag. It basically has all the storage capacity of the basket bag, plus a large rolltop area, as well as some external pockets and a bunch of loops for attachments. Overall, it seems pretty close to the Borough Rolltop bag in terms of storage capacity. That's exactly what I was looking for, since Brompton hasn't deemed Electric owners worthy of one yet.\n\n[The depth and width of the bag's primary compartment are nearly identical to the borough basket, but the height is much greater and recovers some of the depth lost to the battery. for larger items. Note: those are two pockets in there, not one big laptop sleeve.](https://preview.redd.it/y1awavhxkpqb1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44806437474001a12665f3f3169fb5f9973197c8)\n\nBut unlike the Borough Rolltop, the Lumabag is worn as a backpack by default. I suspected carrying the battery in a backpack would be more comfortable than a messenger or tote design, but the quality-of-life improvement was even larger than I expected.\n\nOn the other bags, the weight balance always felt a little weird, and those 5+ pounds of battery inevitably dig a bit into your shoulder after a few minutes of lugging it around.\n\nBut with a backpack, you barely feel the weight of the battery thanks to the even weight distribution. Moreover, because the battery is centered on your back and fixed to the frame, you don't have the awkward swinging weight you get with the messenger-type options, or even with throwing the battery into a regular backpack. And as an added bonus, it's easier to carry the relatively heavy (for a Brompton) bike when your other arm is a little more free.\n\n[The straps attach to the back magnetically and are cleverly angled upwards to prevent them from touching the wheel](https://preview.redd.it/spzvx0k6lpqb1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bd0bb5b13148bf74223a248549a06f6698463ee)\n\nI was worried about the hard frame digging into my back, but it's not as much of an issue as I expected; there's sufficient padding, and it altogether doesn't feel much different from having a large laptop in a regular backpack.\n\nThat said, looking at the photos on the Lumabag site, I did wonder how I would carry the bag if it was stuffed to the brim. It would be awkward to have an open rolltop sticking out of the left side of my back, and uncomfortable to carry all that weight with the plastic handle.\n\nTo my pleasant surprise -- it's not mentioned on the site, as far as I can tell -- it turned out the bag can be used in a messenger style when needed. It includes a removeable shoulder strap and has sturdy attachment points on the back. \n\nAside from letting you maximize storage capacity, the shoulder strap comes in handy when you're shopping and want to quickly throw things inside the open rolltop. It can also be used to help secure loads when the bag is full. \n\nAgain, it's more comfortable to carry as a backpack, but it's great to have options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7mtjxwuwmqqb1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ae912aefb96257297333de7c2ce6863848a13e8\n\nThe bag is nicely water resistant, as I tested during recent heavy rain in NYC. It's not fully waterproof, as water can still come in through the seams, but I spent about 30 minutes riding in the rain and my groceries arrived dry. The front pocket was a little damp, but nothing too bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygoe8x7nrqqb1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb5c2492cbd57ae48f239e41a3e091ed7ab7f766\n\nI personally think the Lumabag looks quite nice too, in a functional type of way. It's available in multiple colors. I dig the blue waxed cotton on mine, and having had bags made of similar materials before, I appreciate that they age gracefully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The reflective material in the front pouch is quite bright.](https://preview.redd.it/d3o2w65yrqqb1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6724ad5349d6712250d11d994a3b04c012261ac2)\n\nSome other highlights and thoughts:\n\n* The front external pocket and bits of the sides are lined with reflective fabric; this gets quite bright under direct light.\n* The straps for the rolltop part attach magnetically and are easy to tighten and loosen. This also serves to help the backpack get slimmer when it's empty and on your back.\n* The backpack straps magnetically snap onto the back of the bag at an angle that prevents them from dangling down and into the wheels.\n* It took about 7 days from payment to delivery from Bremen, Germany to NYC. Actual time in transit was only two days.\n* There's one side pocket on the left/top that's totally open, but it holds things like my coffee mug securely. You can finagle the rolltop portion to act as a bit of of a \"cover\" if you need it.\n* Although the rolltop portion partially covers the light sensor sometimes, it still seemed to work just fine.\n\n[If you tighten the straps all the way, the bag can have a much thinner profile.](https://preview.redd.it/uzw5dyu2oqqb1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f639246e38300c58e69f7fbb0d56a75a77a300c5)\n\nMy only real complaint is that it can be little hard to install the battery in the bag if you frequently remove it (I have two batteries I regularly swap between), and it would be nice if it came with a full waterproof cover for the price.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a way to maximize cargo capacity and convenience on your Brompton Electric, I think the Lumabag is well worth it. Even if Brompton came out with an official Borough Rolltop Bag for the electric, I'd want to stick to this one.",

Here're some insights:\n\nGood:- The material is superb, it seems that it'll last for years- Using it as a backpack is very comfortable- Lots of space- Not as bulk is thought it would be\n\nBad (keep in mind that there aren't many options in the market, so this is ok actually)- No shoulder straps include in the package, so if one wants to use it as a messenger style bag a shoulder strap will have to be bought separately- Found it kind of annoying that there's no way to open the big compartment with a zipper- The bag won't stand up properly while in \"landscape mode\"",

                "body": "I bought it recently also. In fact, if you take out the front metal support frame which is installed inside the bag, it can actually stand up properly. Plus, by taking the frame out, the bag looks less \"rigid\", more like a normal casual backpack. From my experience, it is perfectly functional without the front frame for daily use, but if you tend to carry a large weight or volume in the bag, maybe it's better with the frame in to make it more steady.",

Like you I realized the city bag is totally not enough, it can barely hold one laptop + 2 chargers and a headset. I'd like to carry some docs and books too. If you put in too much stuff, would you still be able to use it as a backpack? Thanks!",

                "body": "So far, so great! I think you should be able to carry all that without an issue, though you have to keep an eye on the recommended weight limit of course (I've definitely exceeded it, but I guess I like to live dangerously). I've actually been considering using some straps around the plastic handle to help relieve some of the load off the front block for really heavy loads.  \n\n\nAnyways, even just going from the City Bag to the Borough Basket felt like a big upgrade space-wise, because the internal volume felt so poorly used in the former. On the Lumabag, the front pouch is fairly big, so you might be able to fit a charger or two there, else they will definitely fit in the rolltop portion. The backpack might be slightly lopsided when loaded heavily but that shouldn't be a big deal unless you're really using all that extra rolltop portion.",

You’ve got space for a couple of things broken apart like laptop, lunch, some papers or things for work, but anything larger just becomes impossible (unless you strap it to the rack).\n\nPicked up the Basket Bag recently and it made shopping so much easier and functional (as long as it isn’t raining).\n\nThe Lumabag looks interesting.  Maybe in the future, but there’s only so many bags you can buy at once. :)",

If one already has the city bag, I do think think its cover would probably cover the basket as well, which could have the added bonus of securing small loose contents. \n\nI do like the basket bag a lot. I think the only thing I'd change is including pockets on the back for water bottles and the like.",
