If I had to guess I'd say it's a poor choice for airline travel, because it's too small for under the seat, but at 25L it also doesn't really make sense as your only bag to go in the overhead bin (unless you really want to travel light).  \n\nCan you get your hands on one in person, maybe at REI and measure it?",

I'll be the first to tell you that crag pack with a big ole zipper is way easier to just cram a bunch of crap in and easily get it out while hanging out at the bottom of the wall for a day of single pitch or top rope stuff.  Of course, if you're hiking in your gear and climbing with the pack, or need to haul your pack, or whatever, that's a different story.  This pack doesn't have a padded hip belt, so if you load it up with climbing gear, it's not going to be super comfy. On the other hand, it'll work better than a padded belt when you're climbing.\n\nAs /u/tatarstas mentioned, it's not particularly light for a light hiking pack, but go much lighter and it's going to come apart after a season or two of hauling, loading it up with a rack of cams and dropping it on scree, etc.\n\nReally just depends on what you're doing and what your needs are.\n\nClimbing and hiking range from gym rats and nature walks to winter alpine ascents and peak bagging, and different bags will be better at either end of the spectrum.",

My main complaint is the hipbelt on mine (and looks the same on the 35) is like 1inch webbing which does very poor in transferring load on to your hips. It's fine when I only had water and some quickdraws and stuff, but with all my trad gear, I had to modify some hipbelt padding on to it. \n\nOverall, like the other guy said, it's kinda big/heavy for a hiking pack, but I got mine for cheap and say it's a solid cragging pack. I can fit my food, water, and gear. Hope that helps",
