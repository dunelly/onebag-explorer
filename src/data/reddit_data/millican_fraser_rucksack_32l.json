Like [this one for exemple](https://www.etsy.com/listing/594693481/waxed-canvas-backpack-rolltop-backpack?ref=shop_home_active_14&amp;frs=1), but this is just one amongst many. ( This shop in particular I have bought a lunch bag from them, really great people and products). It is very easy to have a bag modified or custom made to your taste. Definitly check this out.\n\nLastly , if you start looking into these kind of bags , there should be plenty of targeted ads popping on facebook / instagram with that kind of bag. At least that's my case.\n\nGood luck !",

I actually quite like this system. + it will only get easier when you get used to it. \n\nOnly downside is it is harder to close if the bag is full to the top, because they need some loose tension to be closed.\n\nAnd if it really bothers you, a dude on the comment section of [this vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdW6J4zGHE0&amp;)\nsays that he replaced them with Austri Alpin Cobra buckles. \n\nAs for the Huru H2 , I had never heard of it , it looks really cool !!",
