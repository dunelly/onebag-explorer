So, I wonder if one of the Rhake colorways will be \"special\" and have the hi-vis liner. Can't tell from the pics. Also, hasta la vista Cobra buckles.

If the Rhake multicam is actually made of that stuff ... it is a better deal than the VX21.\n\nI really want Mission Workshop to make a large rolltop duffle (50-60L but rolls down to 30L or so) with orange lined X50/52. Basically [YNot Viken](https://www.ynotmade.com/en/shop/viken/) but with X-Pac X50.... but given how much this bag cost... I'm guessing it would be like $600.00... a shame.",

I own bags from EverGoods, Peak Design (all of them), Brown Buffalo, Porter, Mixed Works, Teranishi and had (sold) the Arcteryx Veilance Nomin and bags from DSPCH and Cote Ciel. I have yet to find the perfect bag. \n\nI have three regular bag needs (not counting weekend trips out of the house with just iPad or camera). Those tasks are left to the Mission Workshop SPAR, the Peak slings, or the new Tech Intern Series 1 bags - https://www.massdrop.com/buy/massdrop-x-intern-series-1-pockets-packits\n\n1.\tBag for my commute - needs to carry iPad, Surface and MacBook (sometimes) along with dongles, chargers, battery, and misc stuff.\n2.\tBag for a week or more of domestic or international travel (in addition to roller carry-on or checked luggage) - without all my camera gear but perhaps one body and 2 lenses but iPad, laptop, Bulky headphones, Nintendo Switch, dongles and cables galore, passports and documents for family, a book or two, kindle etc. probably 25L of stuff.\n3.\tTrip where Photography is the primary or secondary purpose - Peak Design 20L or 45L with or without the 5L or 10L sling.\n\nFor #1 I really like the Mixed Works Falcon in “S”. It’s perfect and I love the Cobra Buckle. http://www.mixedworks.com/en/backpacks/falcon-s.html\n\nI love it so much I ordered the medium for #2 before I learned about the Rhake VX.\n\nI got this bag for #2 to replace my EverGoods CPL 24 https://evergoods.us/collections/civic/products/civic-panel-loader-24l\n\nI don’t love the CPL. The material is not my favorite and it lacks enough organization. Peak nails all the thoughtful organization.\n\nThe Mission Workshop Rhake VX hits on all the things I’m looking for.\n\n1.\tDedicated tablet pocket\n2.\tDedicated laptop pocket\n3.\t2 storage pockets\n4.\t1 large internal pocket with an internal sleep\n5.\tExternal pockets for chargers and dongles\n6.\tHidden optional water bottle pocket\n\nThere are so many things to love about this bag including the fidlock buckles and material. I wish the front buckle were also fidlock. \n\nI’ll post a full review after completing my next international trip. For now it won’t get a ton of use as it’s a bit to large for a daily carry. I love the Mixed Works and that cobra buckle :-).\n\nGreat job MW - this is the first bag they have made that met all my requirements!\n\nNote: the main compartment is 22L - the bag is larger than a normal 22L though cause of all the other compartments and storage. It feels like a much larger bag (but not huge).\n\nI had my eye on the TAD Axion 24 - but impossible to get in Black - https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/axiom-24-pack/\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "# Mission Workshop Rhake Review\n\nI only put that subtitle in there so that people looking for info on the Rhake can find this more easily on Google. The following isn’t really a review — I just want to share some of my experience of the last few weeks with the Rhake with you and point out some of the stuff that other reviews missed. \n\n# Introduction\n\nBefore I decided to buy the Rhake I was using the Vandal as my everyday backpack. I bought it years ago when I was still working as a bike messenger and it has been the best backpack I owned so far. But the times changed and I don’t really need a cargo backpack that often anymore.\n\nI commute to work by bike and I take my laptop to work everyday. Besides what I bring home from the grocery store and my gym clothes I don’t have much stuff to carry around nowadays. What I did miss on the Vandal was organization and a proper place to put my laptop. \n\nThe Rhake seemed to be exactly the backpack that met my needs. I won’t bore you with all the details and features because you probably know them already from all the other sites and reviews. What I will do instead is, give you a quick look at how I use it, what I find noteworthy and interesting and how to improve your Rhake a little bit.\n\n# What goes where?\n\nI basically carry the same items everyday but it is a lot of fun to optimize where to store your items as the Rhake gives you lots of options. This is what I usually carry:\n\n* padded laptop compartment\n   * laptop\n* rolltop main compartments\n   * laptop charger\n   * water bottle\n   * rain jacket\n   * gym clothes and climbing shoes\n   * food box\n* tablet / front compartment\n   * (sometimes bike lights and gloves)\n* left zippered pocket\n   * ballpoint pen\n   * in-ear headset\n   * USB cable\n   * swiss army knife\n   * “climb-on” skin nourishment stick\n   * a pack of facial tissues\n   * locker room padlock\n* right zippered pocket\n   * notebook/journal\n   * trail mix\n   * ebook reader\n* bottom pouch\n   * tool roll with bike tools\n   * (sometimes bike lights)\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nThe tablet front compartment only works for me if the backpack isn’t filled to the brim. It becomes difficult to get items in and out when the pouch is flattened and you always pull the liner out. I like that pocket nonetheless and it isn’t so much of a problem when the pouch can grow into the main compartment.\n\nThe horizontal straps can serve as a U-lock holder. A feature I dearly missed on the Vandal. Now I can just swing the bag around my side and shove the lock in and out. Pretty neat! \n\nThe secret pocket that has the elastic water bottle holder can serve as a place to put your wallet or smartphone. In case you put a wallet in there it should be a slim one — big items will pike your kidney and it will be uncomfortable.\n\n# Capacity\n\nMission Workshop’s statement about the Rhake having a 22 liter main compartment is very accurate.  There was a time where I was very skeptical, though, because I was seeing lots of other backpacks that are also said to have around 20 liter of volume but looked smaller than the Rhake.\n\nI did a little experiment and put a trashbag inside the Rhake’s main compartment and filled it with water. After filling it with 25 liters, the water level was as high as the internal zipper compartment. That’s impressive but please keep in mind that this also means that there isn’t enough gusset length anymore to use the rolltop function. I didn’t pour more than 25 liters in there because I was too lazy to clean up an eventual mess.\n\nHave a look at the photos I took. The lighting is not the best so I added a water texture I got from Google Image Search to help you see the waterline.\n\n[https://i.redd.it/j2znr8a6ife21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/j2znr8a6ife21.jpg)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/ntkdyq86ife21.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ntkdyq86ife21.jpg)\n\nUnder normal circumstances, your items also won’t fill the space as efficiently as water does — and it already is hard to access the smaller compartments from the outside if the bag’s 22 liters are used up. With 22 liters of water in there, the Rhake got quite a belly making it impossible to access items in the external pockets and it became a real effort to close the zippers.\n\nCarrying a laptop in the dedicated laptop compartment will reduce its capacity by a greater margin than you might think. The padding is generous and an inserted laptop will prevent the backpacks main space from bulging outwards leading to a higher stack of items inside.\n\nSee the photo below for an example of what can fit inside when there’s no laptop involved. Please note that the small items stored in the front pockets are excluded from the photo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[What fits into the Rhake.](https://preview.redd.it/nrdt0mcl7xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02bb846654b0f40830982d8b3983a39362bedcc6)\n\n[The Gadgeteer claims](https://the-gadgeteer.com/2018/04/06/mission-workshop-rhake-backpack-review/) that you can fit 28 liters in there using the adjustable strap. That sounds plausible but I doubt that they really measured it. Additionally, do not expect it to be weatherproof anymore and make sure that you have a large item on top and not small ones that can fall out of the bag.\n\n# What other reviews criticised and has since been fixed\n\nFrom what I gathered from the web, there are at least three different iterations of the Rhake by now: \n\n* [v1 w/ load lifter straps, one zipper slider on each front pocket](https://vimeo.com/258881943)\n* [v2 w/ load lifter straps , two zipper sliders on each front pocket](https://www.magneticmag.com/culture/mission-workshop-rhake-weatherproof-backpack-review)\n* [v3 no load lifter straps, two zipper sliders on each front pocket](https://imgur.com/a/tQSYStY)\n\nMaybe the length of the rolltop closing strap also changed from one iteration to the other but I’m not sure about that.\n\n[Bo Ismono stated that one needs to be very diligent when closing the front zippered pockets. ](https://youtu.be/XXbMt6oPqv0?t=166)The zipper had to be closed completely to prevent water ingress. As current Rhakes have two zippers on each front pocket instead of one, there are more options in opening/closing the pockets. Closing the zipper leaving the zipper slides on the side or bottom of the pocket will make it impossible for water to ingress. The second zipper slide is really a handy upgrade!\n\nWhile at first, I thought I’d miss the load lifter straps on the shoulders (knowing that I made heavy use of them on my Vandal), I can’t say that I actually did so far. I guess Mission Workshop removed them as a lot of reviews complained about the Rhake having too many straps and that user testing showed that they weren’t actually needed on a slim 22 liter backpack. \n\n## Improving the zipper pulls \n\nIt can be cumbersome to find/grab the zipper pulls for the front pockets when they’re hiding in the nook that forms below the tablet pocket when the bag is saggy. As a remedy, you can replace the zipper pulls with ones that are a few centimeters longer. While you’re at it, you can also attach zipper pulls to the tablet compartment and the bottom pocket, if you like. To do that, it’s best to use paracord type 750 IV (4.2mm diameter) and remove 3-4 strands of the core filaments. That way they’ll have a nice soft oval touch and won’t be so firm. (I think that’s what Mission Workshop did to their cords). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Comparison of original and my custom zipper pull length.](https://preview.redd.it/374zi1yf7xl21.jpg?width=6072&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff7616b84cb71edbb16d3e257efaede33c5ee83a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Longer zipper pull](https://preview.redd.it/2ac5dknb7xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13c55325d9cde695e98e87070d907f01526a288e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Remove 3-4 core strands from the paracord to give it a better feel.](https://preview.redd.it/3vz0j6197xl21.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab7215db593928d50e3799b12bb921011b6edf5a)\n\n## Improving the rolltop strap\n\nIn a photo by [/u/elliotpayne](https://www.reddit.com/user/elliottpayne) I saw a second G-hook attached to the rolltop closing strap. That is really ingenious as it allows to carry more than the Rhake is intended for: the rolltop is left open and the flap is secured by connecting the loop on top of the tablet compartment with the loop on the front of the rolltop flap (see photo).\n\n[An additional G-hook on the rolltop adjustment strap.](https://preview.redd.it/lcom5jg57xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a1dfeb7d25fc3b446ddd52b6922f3b0bddb8c65)\n\n## Cobra buckles\n\nI added 25mm Cobra buckles to the compression straps in the front. They don’t provide a functional benefit over the plastic Duraflex buckles but in my opinion they look great and have a nice handling as well as a great haptic. Opening them one-handedly is easy and silent. In some situations you can even close them one-handedly but most of the time that doesn’t work.\n\n[Carrying snowshoes on the outside of the Rhake. Straps with Cobra buckles.](https://preview.redd.it/49v1ln627xl21.jpg?width=1374&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a884e92ec3f2520e7f14460734e10e41ebc56ee)\n\n## Fidlock V-buckles\n\nUPDATE: I changed back to Cobra buckles after a while. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/MissionWorkshop/comments/amuz5i/an_indepth_look_at_the_mission_workshop_rhake/eifufmj/) for an explanation.\n\nAfter the Rhake VX was released I wanted to try out Fidlock buckles and ordered a pair of them together with so-called Triglide buckles. Attaching them to the straps wasn’t easy because the slot on the Fidlocks can’t really take a folded strap.  I managed to get them through eventually (although I had to use a pair of pliers), and now I hope I won’t have to ever get them off again. \n\nWhile I don’t like the looks of the Fidlock buckles as much as the Cobra buckles they do prove benefitial by allowing me to open/close them quickly with one hand. Lots of reviewers noted that they were a bit annoyed by having to undo compression straps whenever they want to get into one of the front pockets. With Fidlock buckles that has become a non-issue for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Afermarket Fidlock buckle on an HT500 Rhake.](https://preview.redd.it/l47ienhy6xl21.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc7c8c18eb5139d1d8259c50a98837e247b8083f)\n\nFidlock buckles are very interesting due to their magnetic closing mechanism. For those of you wondering how they work on the Rhake I made a small video. Please keep in mind that I handle them a bit clumsily for the purposes of this video (it just shows better how they work).\n\n[Video of me clumsily handling Fidlock buckles on a Rhake.](https://reddit.com/link/amuz5i/video/k8b79xfb1fe21/player)\n\nI was asked whether it'd be possible to use a Fidlock buckle on the rolltop adjustment strap as well and I can't recommend it.\n\nFirst of all you either need a \"split bar\" V-Buckle in order to attach the female part to the loop on top of the tablet / front compartment, or you can simply saw the bar in half yourself. Secondly, due to the vertical orientation of the strap, the female part will often end up flipped-over making it more difficult to close the strap than with the g-hook.\n\n[Fidlock V-Buckle as rolltop closure.](https://preview.redd.it/pj8bdgtvike21.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=856183115d29a8432099425c51de09715eb10846)\n\n# Lubricate the zippers\n\nZippers are the weak part of any backpack. I’d wager if there ever is a defect on a Mission Workshop backpack it’s probably a zipper having reached its end of life . They did on my Vandal.\n\nThe Rhake is a backpack with more zippers than usual. And what makes matters even more delicate is that the two front pocket zippers are going around a corner. I used teflon/PTFE bike lube on all the zippers and they flow more easily afterwards. That’s especially nice for the aforementioned pockets because they become easier to open and close.\n\n## Verdict\n\nFollowing the tao of essentialism, I’m really happy I bought the Rhake. It is a product that fills me with joy  whenever I use it and therefore I wouldn’t want to miss it. It is well made, durable, versatile and helps me keep my stuff organized and at hand. ",

However, I sold the MC Rhake for the VX version. \n\nAlthough I loved the multi cam Rhake, I hated the standard gray liner. Anytime you take something out of the main compartment, the liner gets pulled out along with the items you are trying to take out. The material is lacks structure so it was very floppy for  a lack of better words. I got very luck with the VX Rhake. I picked it up second hand and it turned out to be a rare bag in the sense that the inside liner was also made of the light grey VX material. The new material solves the floppiness of the MC bag and the issue with the liner being pulled out. The VX material in my opinion is structurally superior. Looks are subjective, but the VX is more suitable for taking to work and meetings. The Rhake is not ideal as an EDC. The main compartment is too shallow and if you just put a few items in the front organizational flaps, it bites into the main section. However, if you pack light, laptop, dongles, teach pouch, a few folders/books, and a light jacket/sweater, it's perfect for that. \n\nThe Khyte has way more cargo capacity and can stuff way more gear, however, it will not be as comfortable because of the one strap. Again, VX is the way to go. I have lower back problems so I tend to grab the back pack verses the messenger. With that said, I've never had an issue with the strap on the Khyte. \n\nRhake+: Looks, VX material, very comfortable on shoulders, makes you pack lighter and think about what you actually need for the day.\n\nRhake-: Capacity, a bit tall on the back, outside pockets are a cool idea, but in practice dramatically affect what can be packed in the main compartment.\n\nKhyte+: Looks (great as a work bag), VX material, Capacity.\n\nKhyte-: Not as comfortable as back pack style (only if wearing for a longer period of time), items in the main compartment with slide down, the tech pouch sometimes sticks out past the flaps when bag is full.",

Could you elaborate? It’d also be great to see a picture when the Default is stuffed and empty. I can’t see to find pictures of the Default with its roll top expanded. I wasn’t sure if the mechanism allows you to expand the pack while having a secure closure (doesn’t have to be water tight).  🙇🏻",

Yeah, what you see here is the Default almost full but not to the brim, &amp; apart from “buttons” to secure it at two points when fully extended, there’s no way to close/secure it as the Velcro’d middle “tongue” isn’t long enough.\n\nIn terms of “feel”, although it is pretty solidly built, it’s flimsy &amp; just doesn’t have that solid quality feel I’m accustomed to with MW gear. It doesn’t have the carbon fiber backing like MW, the waist strap is a flimsy piece of thin strap, unlike MW’s solid thick waist straps. I’ll try to post pics of both. \n\nThe inside looks like somebody just threw in a piece of thin sailcloth-like fabric &amp; then that’s it. Plain &amp; no reinforcement stitchings...\n\nThe only two positive things I like are it’s light &amp; way cheaper.\n\nMW is like BMW, once you’ve “tasted” them you’ll never want any other bags.\n\nDisclaimer: I’m not a MW staff, &amp; I’m not paid/sponsored to say this. I just have an eye for quality. 😅",
