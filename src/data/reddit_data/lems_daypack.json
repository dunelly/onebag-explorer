        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go.

I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe.

I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it.

I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it.

Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1jalv1a/mexico_oaxaca_cdmx_7_day_work_trip_28l/",
        "selftext": "I recently went on a work trip to Mexico, which brought me through Oaxaca city, several days in rural mountain villages, and finally about 24 hours in CDMX. I work in the coffee industry, and this was a trip in which we met met with exporters in Oaxaca city, traveled to remote farms in the Oaxaca mountains, and ended with a day to explore all CDMX had to offer. The following is my packing list with some notes on most items, along with a few takeaways.\n\nPlease note that I know this wasn't an extensive trip, but the variety of settings and amount of travel time (5 total flight incl. connections, plus many hours on the road) meant that I set out to be extra considerate in what I brought with me. This particular type of trip is not a regular occurrence for me, but I do travel often for work domestically (US) and typically use an 18L or 28L bag.\n\nI am not a long-term traveler or nomad or ultra-minimalist by any means, but have enjoyed the pursuit of one-bag travel in some capacity for almost 2 decades, from short trips as a teenager with only a schoolbag to several multi-week trips abroad. I feel pretty dialed in these days, but continue to browse this sub for tips and inspiration after many years of doing so. Happy to hear any thoughts or recommendations, and hope you enjoy!\n\n**Bag -** ***REI Ruckpack 28 (c. 2023)***\n\n* This is my second iteration of the bag, and I also use the 18L as my daily pack and for short trips. For the size (28L feels just right for me in most cases), cost (\\~$130), build, and quality, I really couldn't ask for much more. I previously used a \\~2019 model with the horribly huge top compartment that I got for cheap, and put in plenty of miles but hated that top compartment so much, so once I realized they redesigned it I was eager to upgrade. My only real complaint is the water bottle pockets being a bit too tight, but this is hardly an issue. I'm also proud to have actually found a use for the side-zipper that opens up to the main compartment, which I had never used on any previous bag with this feature - I position my two smaller packings cubes so they're accessible from this side, and it comes in handy more often than I would've guessed.\n\n**Daypack -** ***REI Flash 22 (c. 2018)***\n\n* This is where some folks may tilt their heads, but hear me out. I knew for this trip that I would be served well by a secondary backpack for day trips to farms and rural towns, and I just have not been able to get myself to spend $40+ on something like the Sea to Summit packable pack (which I honestly think looks a bit ridiculous too). Cue my well-used and well-loved Flash 22, a perfect hiking daypack with basic but appreciated features, and in this case, an effective packing cube when turned inside-out. I've also done this for trips where I would have time for day hikes, and the way it slots perfectly into the Ruckpack (see photos) is super satisfying and works great for my needs and budget. You'll also notice the Eagle Creek lightweight packing cube as well - this thing basically weighs nothing and just makes it a lot easier to painlessly get the clothes into and out of the daypack, and is handy for keeping things organized in whatever rooming I'm staying in.\n\n**Packed Clothes (Eagle Creek L Cube)**\n\n* 1x *Levis XX Travel Chinos* \\- Tried these out for the first time and was quite happy with them. Cheap, comfortable, breathed well during the hot days, and held up over the course of the trip.\n* 1x *Prana Brion Shorts* \\- Was advised to bring shorts but wound up not wearing them. These are my general go-to shorts; look good, feel good, no complaints.\n* 1x *Prana Mojo Shorts* \\- Sleep shorts; normally I won't even bother for work trips, but I wasn't sure if I would be sharing rooms or not. Used once.\n* 2x *Generic cotton-blend t-shirts* \\- Worn once or twice apiece.\n* 1x *Prana button-up -* I used to have access to an employee store, hence all the Prana. Packed in case there were any nicer restaurants or meals to attend.\n* *1x Prana polo* \\- See above.\n* 1x *Generic henley* \\- Cheap, light, thrifted long-sleeve for layering. Really came in handy as nights in the mountains were colder than expected.\n* 1x *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks* \\- Have been an advocate for years, they never disappoint.\n* 2x *ExOfficio briefs* \\- Have also used these for years due to luck finding them on sale. Typically get by with one extra pair on short trips but having a third is nice when hotel-hopping for single nights.\n* *Patagonia Houdini Jacket* \\- Pictured is actually my rain jacket, but I switched it out at the last minute after realizing that it was unlikely to rain, and a smaller/lighter wind jacket would suffice in a pinch.\n* *Bedrock Cairns* \\- These have been my favorite sandals for many years, and I love them as a secondary (and sometimes primary) travel shoe. However, on this trip I didn't use them as much as expected, and could've gone without.\n\n**Worn**\n\n* *Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket* \\- I live in the Midwest, where it was still quite cold when I left. This layered with the henley was just enough to get by when I returned at midnight and it was \\~20F.\n* *Lems Trailheads* \\- My favorite casual travel shoe. Super comfortable, lightweight, looks good, and can handle relatively rugged terrain.\n* *Bison Designs Stealth Belt* \\- Lightweight and durable belt that I picked up on a whim many years ago and still holds up well.\n* *Generic cap*\n* *Darn Tough Light Cushion ankle socks*\n* *ExOfficio briefs*\n* *Generic cotton-blend t-shirt*\n* *Levis XX Travel Chinos*\n\n**Toiletries (Plastic bag)**\n\n* *Oral hygiene* \\- folding toothbrush, toothpaste, refillable mouthwash, mini floss\n* *Pills* \\- baggies of: ibuprofen, pepto, cough drops, vitamins\n* *Deodorant* \\- I do a combo of mini salt crystal and a regular tiny deodorant stick that I refill\n* *Other* \\- sunscreen, face wipes (very thankful for these after long layovers or sweaty flights), mini lip balm, tiny refillable container of hair pomade, hand lotion, mustache comb, disposable razor\n\n**Tech (Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray)**\n\n* *Tom Bihn Small Travel Tray* \\- I really enjoy having this on hand for having a safe spot to dump chargers, receipts, small pocket items, etc. in one place while staying in a hotel/rental room.\n* *iPhone 11 Pro (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Macbook Air (c. 2019) \\[not pictured\\]*\n* *Anker Nano 2-port USB-C Charger* \\- Recently switched to this from the two original charging blocks, and it's been awesome to save the space/weight.\n* *Apple 3-ft USB-C to Lightning cable*\n* *Apple 6-ft USB-C to USB-C cable*\n* *Anker Power Core Slim 10K Battery* \\- Frequently used but a bit bulky, and actually kept in the container listed below.\n* *inCharge 6-in-1 cable* \\- I honestly don't use this much anymore, but it's tiny and handy for holding the converters.\n* *Generic USB-C to USB converters* \\- Used often for my battery, charging on flights, and just great to have for random scenarios (they came in handy for my coworkers a few times).\n\n**Other / Random (Dyneema cube from Etsy)**\n\n* Most of these items are what-ifs that I don't mind keeping on hand because I'm thankful for it when I want or need them.\n* *Small PackTowel, small deck of cards, earplugs, thin buff, K95 mask, a few packets of herbal tea, sanitizing wipes, electrolyte tabs*\n\n**Pockets / Accessible for flight (Top and side pocket of backpack)**\n\n* I will keep most of these in the top pocket of my bag, and if overhead space is available, I will toss them in the tote so I can stow my bag and have more leg room.\n* *Light cotton tote bag* \\- Folds down small and great for flights + a more casual look for walking around cities.\n* *Sea to Summit 1L dry bag* \\- Mostly used for organization in the tote or daypack.\n* *Soundcore P20i Wireless Earbuds* \\- I can't bring myself to spend a fortune on nice earbuds that I feel destined to lose someday, but I've used these for about a year and the sound quality is solid for being so cheap.\n* *Chums wallet* \\- Bought to try out for this trip due to the necessity of cash/coins, and I was quite happy with it. Also actually used the keyring for my house key on the trip home.\n* *Small paperback book \\[not pictured\\]* \\- Grabbed last minute and was happy to have it.\n* *Passport, nail clippers, snack, tissues, hand sanitizer, pen, pencil*\n\n**Takeaways from the trip**\n\n* I was super happy with my choices, and used most of everything outside the what-ifs (and even a few of those). I also had to fit in some other small giveaway items to hand out during the trip, which packed in fine, and allowed ample room to bring back a few souvenirs for my family.\n* The only items I would have left behind were the two pairs of shorts, which were never necessary, and possibly the sandals, which were also unnecessary but did get used because I had them.\n* For anyone curious, I encourage you to give the daypack-in-backpack system a go. As I mentioned, this has served me well when on trips that have opportunities to hike, and really doesn't impact the overall weight or use of your pack much, at least in my practice. And hey, you also have a very spacious extra 22L available should you go shopping-crazy or inherent a priceless family heirloom or something while on your trip.",

I’m not into roll tops usually because they are fussy, but I like the magnetized opening and how you can clip it shut in a couple different ways.\n\nFunctionality: The pack is very light weight, and I like the laptop sleeve side zip access, although I wish it could also access the additional pocket that I use for my iPad. The main area is pretty large and I find it best to use pouches inside to keep things tidy. The roll top opening is easy to get into and close when needed. The two front pockets are really useful.

The straps are really beefy and the pack is very comfortable on my back.\n\nDesign: The pack is unique and impressive looking. I think it works well in the office, around town, or camping. The black square pattern looks great with the olive green accents and clips, and the orange handle and zipper pulls are a nice touch of color. The bottom is a dark brown vinyl leather like material that really goes well. The interior lining is a matching olive green, although many of the other color ways have a bright tactical orange.

        "selftext": "I have been on the lookout for a smaller EDC and the Roark Passenger 27L caught my eye last month in a beach town coffee and surf shop. I thought it looked really unique. Did some research and decided at $99 it is worth a shot. I went with the black color way but many of the other color options look great. I’m not into roll tops usually because they are fussy, but I like the magnetized opening and how you can clip it shut in a couple different ways.\n\nFunctionality: The pack is very light weight, and I like the laptop sleeve side zip access, although I wish it could also access the additional pocket that I use for my iPad. The main area is pretty large and I find it best to use pouches inside to keep things tidy. The roll top opening is easy to get into and close when needed. The two front pockets are really useful. The top pocket is cloth lined for sunglasses and personal tech and the other is a decent size for several small loose items. I wish it had some organization inside though. The straps are really beefy and the pack is very comfortable on my back.\n\nDesign: The pack is unique and impressive looking. I think it works well in the office, around town, or camping. The black square pattern looks great with the olive green accents and clips, and the orange handle and zipper pulls are a nice touch of color. The bottom is a dark brown vinyl leather like material that really goes well. The interior lining is a matching olive green, although many of the other color ways have a bright tactical orange. The zippers are smooth and the front zips are waterproof. The back pocket and laptop zip are not waterproof, and are kinda clunky sounding. I ended up adding a zip pull to mine to shut them up! The black straps are accented with green fabric and clips. The straps don’t have dangle management, but you can add your own. The back pad is quite soft and comfy, but probably won’t breathe well if you’re wearing this out for a long time on a hot day. The two water bottle sleeves on the side are excellent.\n\nThe bag isn’t perfect, but it also only costs $99. For this you get a unique bag that is very versatile and light weight. I really like it.",

        "selftext": "I have been on the lookout for a smaller EDC and the Roark Passenger 27L caught my eye last month in a beach town coffee and surf shop. I thought it looked really unique. Did some research and decided at $99 it is worth a shot. I went with the black color way but many of the other color options look great. I’m not into roll tops usually because they are fussy, but I like the magnetized opening and how you can clip it shut in a couple different ways.\n\nFunctionality: The pack is very light weight, and I like the laptop sleeve side zip access, although I wish it could also access the additional pocket that I use for my iPad. The main area is pretty large and I find it best to use pouches inside to keep things tidy. The roll top opening is easy to get into and close when needed. The two front pockets are really useful. The top pocket is cloth lined for sunglasses and personal tech and the other is a decent size for several small loose items. I wish it had some organization inside though. The straps are really beefy and the pack is very comfortable on my back.\n\nDesign: The pack is unique and impressive looking. I think it works well in the office, around town, or camping. The black square pattern looks great with the olive green accents and clips, and the orange handle and zipper pulls are a nice touch of color. The bottom is a dark brown vinyl leather like material that really goes well. The interior lining is a matching olive green, although many of the other color ways have a bright tactical orange. The zippers are smooth and the front zips are waterproof. The back pocket and laptop zip are not waterproof, and are kinda clunky sounding. I ended up adding a zip pull to mine to shut them up! The black straps are accented with green fabric and clips. The straps don’t have dangle management, but you can add your own. The back pad is quite soft and comfy, but probably won’t breathe well if you’re wearing this out for a long time on a hot day. The two water bottle sleeves on the side are excellent.\n\nThe bag isn’t perfect, but it also only costs $99. For this you get a unique bag that is very versatile and light weight. I really like it.",

        "selftext": "Well, I'll just say it before anyone gets a chance too, haha. We still have a lot of stuff. There's room to improve for sure. But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

I also could have done with only 1 pair of sandals, and originally only had the very flat Xero barefoot sandals, which are great and comfy but don't slip on quickly and can't wear with socks because of the toe loop. I had some room left and had recently bought the cheap Target slip on sandals and really liked that I could still wear them with socks on and just quick access in general. And the pullover hoodie is probably not needed, but I wanted it (if you're a Survivor fan, it's one of my \"luxury items\" lol)",

But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit.

I also could have done with only 1 pair of sandals, and originally only had the very flat Xero barefoot sandals, which are great and comfy but don't slip on quickly and can't wear with socks because of the toe loop. I had some room left and had recently bought the cheap Target slip on sandals and really liked that I could still wear them with socks on and just quick access in general. And the pullover hoodie is probably not needed, but I wanted it (if you're a Survivor fan, it's one of my \"luxury items\" lol)",

But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

        "selftext": "Well, I'll just say it before anyone gets a chance too, haha. We still have a lot of stuff. There's room to improve for sure. But I'm really happy with where we are now, considering how poorly we packed for our first trip to NZ years ago. We each had 2 large pieces of luggage and backpacks that we lugged everywhere. We learned a lot about how not to pack from that trip.\n\nWe are about 2 weeks into the 6 months.\n\nSorry for all the pictures, btw. I thought it could be cool to show how the stuff fits in the bag.\n\nI don't have an itemized list for my wife's bag (which is technically 1 bag and a small bum bag that's always on her). I'll try to get one and update the post or add a comment. Here is what I am carrying...\n\nBackpacks:\n\nCotopaxi Allpa 35L - my wife got hers during their Kickstarter campaign and I liked it so much I got one maybe a year later.\n\nOn Plane:\n- Cotopaxi Hoodie (forgot to picture, also packs in bag if needed)\n-  Black Jeans\n-  Belt -Dakine clamp closure\n- Compression Socks\n- T Shirt\n- Underwear\n- Xero shoes - Daylite Hikers\n- Google Pixel 7\n- rubber band wallet with ID, 1 credit card, small amount of cash\n\n\nOutside Front Pocket:\n- pen\n- Waterproof phone bag\n- sunglasses - Knockaround \n- glasses case/glasses\n- toothbrush\n- headphones in small bag\n- Bluetooth earbuds (definitely redundant)\n- TSA lock\n- Toothpaste tablets\n- silicon toiletries bag\n        - sunscreen\n        - contact solution\n        - contact case\n        - Neosporin\n        - Soov bug bite relief \n        - small sprayer with bug spray\n- Toiletries case with:\n        - OneBlade shaver\n        - OneBlade Shaver attachments\n        - Oneblade Charger\n        - Schick razor\n        - Replacement blades for both\n        - Deodorant\n        - Small scissors\n        - nail clippers\n        - tweezers\n        - brush to clean shaver\n        - reusable q-tip\n- ziplock bags\n- spork (haven't needed yet)\n- airplane amenities kit w/ eye mask and some earplugs\n\nInside top pockets:\n- Cards (haven't used)\n- 6 months of contact lenses (monthlies)\n- spare razors (could have bought these as I go. At least they're small and will get less and less as we go)\n\n\nInside bottom pocket:\n- Rain Jacket -The North Face, this is a little heavier than what I need, but it's what I had.\n- Wool Beanie \n- Travel Towel - Nabaiji, I never saw this towel before I got it and now I see the exact same one all the time when traveling. \n- some generic packable day bag - may not last the whole trip.\n- universal adapter power brick - Zendure is the brand? Idk, I found it left in our room on a cruise a while ago and it worked. 2 usb-c and 3 usb-a outputs. \n- case for battery and cables\n     - external battery INIU (haven't used)\n     - usb-c to usb-c cable \n     - usb-c to usb-a cable x2\n     - USB adapters (haven't used)\n     - 64gb tiny USB drive w/ digital docs\n- GoPro\n- GoPro floaty stick\n\n\nMain Pocket:\n\n- Small Darntough socks \n- Med Darntough socks \n- Tall Darntough socks - I cannot recommend Darntough enough. I seriously love them. I've even used the warranty and it was super easy.\n- 4x underwear - Sax, 32 Degrees, the Sax are overpriced and not that great. I bought a few when I was riding a high from the Darntough socks being freaking amazing. I started thinking that more money was more better. I don't hate the Sax. They're just not worth the price. 32 Degrees feel cheap, but for the price, and how quickly they dry, I would probably buy these in the future. Haven't tried wool underwear yet.\n- Flannel shirt \n- Flipflops in grocery bag, noisy but it works.\n- Hiking Pants - Beta Brand, OK pants. Wouldn't rebuy. 1 zippered front and 1 zippered back pocket is the highlight.\n- 2x Hybrid Shorts - double as swimsuits, I can't remember the brand but I got them at Zumiez (?) skate/surf shop at the mall like 6 years ago and they're still going strong. I would definitely buy these again when they crap out. They also have zippered front pockets.\n- Athletic/sleep shorts\n- active wear t shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- baselayer long sleeve shirt - old Adidas Climatec\n- 3 cotton/poly t shirts\n\nBack Panel:\n- Travel wallet - extra cards/cash\n- passport\n- Lenovo M8 Tablet - for entertainment while at hostels, doubles as storage and a spreadsheet computer for my wife, who loves planning and keeping track of costs.\n- pocket calander (haven't used)\n\nRight now my bag is 9.5kgs and my wife's is 9.8. most of our flights have a 10kg limit, except 1 HK Express flight that is 7kg. I THINK that's just the carryon. I couldn't find specifics on the personal, so we still have to figure that out.\n\nWhen the trip is winding down, or after we are back, I want to do this again and see how the bags have changed. I have a feeling some things are going to be dumped/donated.\n\nAnd finally, this is my favorite sub. So much inspiration. Idk why, but I love all things packing, folding methods, bags, small bags that go in bigger bags, all of it. So thanks for putting your lists out there for people like me to see. \n\nHoly shit. Sorry this is so long.",

I also could have done with only 1 pair of sandals, and originally only had the very flat Xero barefoot sandals, which are great and comfy but don't slip on quickly and can't wear with socks because of the toe loop. I had some room left and had recently bought the cheap Target slip on sandals and really liked that I could still wear them with socks on and just quick access in general. And the pullover hoodie is probably not needed, but I wanted it (if you're a Survivor fan, it's one of my \"luxury items\" lol)",

Also might be worth bringing extra small bags such as packing cubes and pack them into your daypack. I found that when I was based in a particular city, I would travel to nearby cities for a few days, but would completely survive off a day pack while my bigger bag was securely locked in a hostel in the bigger city but also you have 3-4 days worth of clothes in your daypack so you don't need to keep accessing your bigger bag. The only flaw with this bag, is the laptop sleeve compartment in the front, whatever you do, dont put any electronics there. My backup phone snapped in half lol. Have fun!",

Plus a travel hairdryer, and my medicine bag annoyingly taking up a lot of space but nothing I can do about that 🙄 Actually ended up with even more medicine after a nasty fall down a volcano (no broken bones thankfully, but bad open wound cuts and bruises). \n\nI had less shirts, only 2 long sleeve hiking shirts, 2 tank tops, 1 tshirt. The tank tops and tshirt are long gone, have been replacing them from Mega Pacas. \n\nI also packed a thick hoodie/fleece I got from Ecuador, AMAZING for keeping warm on the volcanoes! Not so great for night breezes in warmer places. I bought a lighter weight one in Guatemala for that. Also have a winter hat with ear flaps and gloves, cuz I struggled to find any at home that fit so once I found them I BRING them. And a fall coat, which I wear over the thick Ecuador hoodie. It's LL Bean and doubles as a rain jacket in warmer climates, and with many pockets!\n\nOh also a travel heating pad, which is one of my BEST packing decisions! On shorter trips, I always missed it but was home to use it again in a few weeks. For many months, that lil thing is a miracle worker! Love being able to relax my muscles right away 🙂 \n\n3 months in was when I gave up on one-bagging. I carry food from hostel to hostel, plus that extra hoodie. And I'm now in warmer weather areas, so my winter stuff is just sitting on the bottom of my bag (it's good quality and FITS me, so I'm not willing to leave those behind cuz I struggle enough to find clothes that fit nvm good quality) for a while. Also picked up some notebooks from my Spanish lessons that I still study from.\n\nI think maybe if I stop cooking my own food and don't carry snacks, then I could one bag again, but I'm not a fan of a grumbly tummy. It's not so bad having my big pack plus my daypack as a carryon on the chicken busses. I didn't expect to have a need for so much more stuff when I started out!",

I found that when I was based in a particular city, I would travel to nearby cities for a few days, but would completely survive off a day pack while my bigger bag was securely locked in a hostel in the bigger city but also you have 3-4 days worth of clothes in your daypack so you don't need to keep accessing your bigger bag.

Also might be worth bringing extra small bags such as packing cubes and pack them into your daypack. I found that when I was based in a particular city, I would travel to nearby cities for a few days, but would completely survive off a day pack while my bigger bag was securely locked in a hostel in the bigger city but also you have 3-4 days worth of clothes in your daypack so you don't need to keep accessing your bigger bag. The only flaw with this bag, is the laptop sleeve compartment in the front, whatever you do, dont put any electronics there. My backup phone snapped in half lol. Have fun!",

Not so great for night breezes in warmer places. I bought a lighter weight one in Guatemala for that. Also have a winter hat with ear flaps and gloves, cuz I struggled to find any at home that fit so once I found them I BRING them. And a fall coat, which I wear over the thick Ecuador hoodie. It's LL Bean and doubles as a rain jacket in warmer climates, and with many pockets!\n\nOh also a travel heating pad, which is one of my BEST packing decisions! On shorter trips, I always missed it but was home to use it again in a few weeks. For many months, that lil thing is a miracle worker! Love being able to relax my muscles right away 🙂 \n\n3 months in was when I gave up on one-bagging. I carry food from hostel to hostel, plus that extra hoodie. And I'm now in warmer weather areas, so my winter stuff is just sitting on the bottom of my bag (it's good quality and FITS me, so I'm not willing to leave those behind cuz I struggle enough to find clothes that fit nvm good quality) for a while.

Trust me that metal water bottle swinging around gets annoying real quick, let's just say I had never been more delighted to 'lose' something within the first few weeks of traveling. Also might be worth bringing extra small bags such as packing cubes and pack them into your daypack. I found that when I was based in a particular city, I would travel to nearby cities for a few days, but would completely survive off a day pack while my bigger bag was securely locked in a hostel in the bigger city but also you have 3-4 days worth of clothes in your daypack so you don't need to keep accessing your bigger bag. The only flaw with this bag, is the laptop sleeve compartment in the front, whatever you do, dont put any electronics there. My backup phone snapped in half lol. Have fun!",

Plus a travel hairdryer, and my medicine bag annoyingly taking up a lot of space but nothing I can do about that 🙄 Actually ended up with even more medicine after a nasty fall down a volcano (no broken bones thankfully, but bad open wound cuts and bruises). \n\nI had less shirts, only 2 long sleeve hiking shirts, 2 tank tops, 1 tshirt. The tank tops and tshirt are long gone, have been replacing them from Mega Pacas. \n\nI also packed a thick hoodie/fleece I got from Ecuador, AMAZING for keeping warm on the volcanoes! Not so great for night breezes in warmer places. I bought a lighter weight one in Guatemala for that. Also have a winter hat with ear flaps and gloves, cuz I struggled to find any at home that fit so once I found them I BRING them. And a fall coat, which I wear over the thick Ecuador hoodie. It's LL Bean and doubles as a rain jacket in warmer climates, and with many pockets!\n\nOh also a travel heating pad, which is one of my BEST packing decisions! On shorter trips, I always missed it but was home to use it again in a few weeks. For many months, that lil thing is a miracle worker! Love being able to relax my muscles right away 🙂 \n\n3 months in was when I gave up on one-bagging. I carry food from hostel to hostel, plus that extra hoodie. And I'm now in warmer weather areas, so my winter stuff is just sitting on the bottom of my bag (it's good quality and FITS me, so I'm not willing to leave those behind cuz I struggle enough to find clothes that fit nvm good quality) for a while. Also picked up some notebooks from my Spanish lessons that I still study from.\n\nI think maybe if I stop cooking my own food and don't carry snacks, then I could one bag again, but I'm not a fan of a grumbly tummy. It's not so bad having my big pack plus my daypack as a carryon on the chicken busses. I didn't expect to have a need for so much more stuff when I started out!",

It can flip up and close with a drawstring so you can shove the whole thing in your bag if needed. I like having one if it's the kind of trip where I'm sleeping in a different place each night.",

Didn't purchase any of the add-on modules but I used elastic cord to make a spot for securing misc items on the back of the pack if needed. Also bringing an osprey 20L as a day pack and a fanny pack as a sling bag when I want to travel lighter during the day.

Same with the shorts, I could drop 1 of everything and still be okay but for now I prefer not to. \n\n\nSHOES/ACCESSORIES:\n\n3 pair sunglasses\n2 hats\n1 pair teva sandals\n1 pair LL Bean Chelsea boots\n\nSunglasses are small and light so I'm bringing 2 extra pair.

Also have some external straps, bungee cord I added and carabineers for anything that doesn't pack great.\n\nI think that's about it, I fly out tonight.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/145cn9q/my_first_onebag_trip_1_mo_israel_italy/",
        "selftext": "This sub has been very helpful in learning how to Onebag. I'm sure I'll learn a lot from this trip  but this is what I've decided to pack. Starting with 10 days in Israel doing a variety of outdoor activities and sightseeing. Then, flying into Rome and spending the next 10 days traveling north through Italy/Switzerland/France and ending up in Amsterdam for a family wedding, where I'll spend the last 10 days before going to Germany for 1/2 days to fly back to the US.\n\n\nBAGS: \n\nRoark Accomplice Mule 45L, Osprey 20L Ultralight Dry stuff pack, Fanny Pack\n\nI haven't seen the Roark bag posted on this sub much, but I liked the look of it and checked all the boxes of what I was looking for in my primary bag, mainly size and Interior/exterior compression straps. Didn't purchase any of the add-on modules but I used elastic cord to make a spot for securing misc items on the back of the pack if needed. Also bringing an osprey 20L as a day pack and a fanny pack as a sling bag when I want to travel lighter during the day. They pack down small and can easily fit into each other if I need to up or downsize my daypack while I'm out.\n\n\nCLOTHES:\n\n6 performance Shirts (North Face, Smartwool, REI, Pata merino/polyester blends, 1 Long sleeve)\n2 short sleeve button ups (Pata, Topo)\n1 Long sleeve button up (Cotton On)\n1 Vuori hoodie\n1 crew neck sweater\n1 OR Rain jacket\n\n2 pair of pants (Topo rip stop mountain pants, STOIC venture pants)\n2 pair shorts (Toad &amp; Co, Filson)\n1 pair sweatpants (Patagonia terrebonne jogger)\n1 pair gym/swim shorts (New Balance)\n4 pair polyester underwear\n4 pair merino socks\n\nI know I'm bringing more shirts than I'll probably need but I prefer to have some different colors to wear. Same with the shorts, I could drop 1 of everything and still be okay but for now I prefer not to. \n\n\nSHOES/ACCESSORIES:\n\n3 pair sunglasses\n2 hats\n1 pair teva sandals\n1 pair LL Bean Chelsea boots\n\nSunglasses are small and light so I'm bringing 2 extra pair. Chelsea boots are a bit cumbersome but I'm not really a sneaker guy, I pretty much always wear boots or sandals so I'm sticking with what I know.\n\nTECH:\n\n1 Biolite power bank\n1 Beats fitpro earbuds\n1 DeWalt worksite Bluetooth earbuds\n1 JBL speaker\n2 USB-C cords\n1 Micro USB cord\n1 Samsung super fast charger\n1 EU power adapter\n\nBringing extra earbuds as backup, and bringing the speaker to return to a family member who I accidentally stole it from 😅. Otherwise I would leave it behind but it's small and nice to have.\n\n\nTOILETRIES/MISC:\n\nToothbrush/Paste/Floss\nShampoo/Body Wash/Conditioner\nMisc Assorted Medications\nChapstick/Sunscreen\n1 pack towel + hand towel\n1 inflatable neck pillow\n1 platypus 1L water pouch\n1 16oz insulated mug\n1 Basic first aid kit\n6 packing cubes/ mesh zipper bags (for all clothing besides what I'm wearing and sweater.)\n1 cable pack lock (for hostel lockers/bag\n1 passport\n1 ID\n2 credit cards\n1 Notepad/Pen\n\n\nI'm planning on staying at hostels, so decided to bring my own shampoo, etc. Towel is mainly for the beach/hot tubs if I can find any. Platypus to carry extra water with me, insulated mug to use for other drinks/ice when I can find it.\n\n\nI'll be changing what I'm wearing day to day but I've got some extra space in my bag to accommodate the boots/sweaters when I'm not wearing as many layers. Also have some external straps, bungee cord I added and carabineers for anything that doesn't pack great.\n\nI think that's about it, I fly out tonight. Thanks for reading, let me know what you think!",

I don't own many clothes and typically wear the same outfits at home so the lack of outfits was not a concern to me. I will have one nice outfit for any occasion and all of the hotels I am staying at will provide pajamas and laundry facilities. I will wash underwear when I shower and have a spare pair to easily rotate. When I need to wash any of my other clothes, I can in the sink at night, or use the laundry facilities in the hotel and wear the pajamas. The Daylite Sling will be a perfect day pack for exploring Japan as well. Enough room for some snacks, water, wallet, charger, rain coat, etc. I will also have a packable tote with me in case I need to carry anything else. I usually keep souvenirs pretty light on trips, but if there is something I really want to bring home, I can always just use the tote bag as my carry on, or pick up a duffle to bring as a carry on.

It had my shaving razor, 3 in 1 soap (shampoo, conditioner, body wash), nail clippers, sunblock, and qtips. Also brought 3 tide pods in checked baggage.\n\n**Thing I would do differently:** not bring the raincoat (rained once briefly), not bring a thick button up for cold nights (it never was cold), dont bring 6 pairs of socks (I thought I'd go jogging every morning and use the socks, ended up not jogging ever), dont bring a DSLR (way too big and I hated lugging it around, took like 10 photos with it). Bring sunglasses (I had to borrow my gf's).\n\nBasically I used this trip to test if I could onebag it with a bag that fits under the seat. The Synapse 25 fit easily under the seat, even when stuffed full. The Airbnb we stayed at had laundry and we did laundry twice. Having the insulated water bottle was great, we filled it with ice cubes and water in the morning, and brought a spare 1L bottle of water at the local supermaket. When we finished drinking from the insulated bottle, it still had ice in it and we could pour our warm water from the spare bottle in to make ice cold water again. Great for a long day at the beach.\n\nObviously this was a trip to a warm climate so my clothing was much lighter. Packing for a cooler climate I'd have sweaters and thermals. So not sure if I would be able to one bag it as well.",

                "body": "**Dislikes:** The Synapse tends to not stand up when the front section is filled. It kind of flops over. Even with the internal frame that I bought for it (also there is nothing to hold the internal frame to the back of the bag when empty. the lower portion of the frame moves around if nothing is in the bottom of the bag pushing the frame against your back.) The shoulder pads are pretty thin and rough, they could have been made thicker; pretty painful wearing the backpack on sunburned shoulders. Top grab handle is a thin piece of webbing, could have been more substantial. I guess I could mod it to add some cushioned wrap around it. Bag didn't come with zipper pulls on the zippers. I will add them later but i feel they should come with them stock. Also the zippers are a bit hard to pull, requiring both hands (one to pull zipper and one to hold fabric behind the zipper. I think it may be easier with zipper pulls installed.\n\n**Likes:** The water bottle pocket in the center is genius, fits my large insulated bottle easily, and doesn't unbalance the bag since its in the center. I like how each pocket has its space and doesn't impede into the spaces of the other compartments (unlike the Mission Workshop Vandal I have where the front pockets are useless when the main part is full). Each pocket can still be used when the other compartments are stuffed full. I like that the waist belt and sternum strap were stock, I used them both when hiking. Having the multiple pockets was good, I was able to store pens/sharpies, sunblock, sunglasses, etc in their designated pockets. The pockets and placement are well thought out. For instance the center pocket to store your wallet/passport is a shallow depth, not super deep where you'll have a hard time accessing it. I like that the bag can be used for one bagging, and as a day bag when I get to my destination. For instance we used it to carry snorkel gear, carry sandwiches/lunch, carry things we bought when shopping.\n\nOverall great bag. I love that its MiUSA, has a good warranty, and the company is enthusiastic about their products. ",

I wanted a bag that fit under the seat because many airlines are starting to charge for overhead bin use. For my flight which was an american airlines economy ticket, it cost extra to use the overhead bin. So I wanted a bag I could use to travel without extra fees in the future.\n\nThe 45L setout doesn't seem like it fits under the seat. Also its so big Im not sure I'd use it as a day bag for hiking or a day at the beach or mall. With the setout you may need to bring a small packable bag for day to day stuff. But you would be able to bring alot with the setout and it does seem to have great comfortable straps. I'd think of the setout as a bag you carry your stuff for traveling and you'd dump at the hotel/hostel. Like a portable suitcase.\n\nIve seen Tom Bihn has a bag called the aeronaut 30L which seems like a good size between the Synpase and the Setout. I'm not sure if it fits under the seat but I would carry the Aeronaut as a daypack.",

        "selftext": "Hey all! Recently back from a West Coast (USA) road trip for work. I had a chance to try out a lot of gear that I bought earlier in the year but hadn’t used yet due to Covid cancellations, and brought along a couple favorite pieces as well. I’ve learned a lot from the posts here, so thought I’d chip in and share my experience. I’m pretty new to one bag, though several years ago I did 2 weeks in Eastern and Northern Europe with just a 20L daypack (2 outfits, wash in sink nightly) before I knew what it was called.\n\nI’m an environmental consultant, and my co-worker and I needed to survey some beach areas along the Columbia River, including some accessible only by boat. We normally would have flown for this, but due to Covid we decided to drive, allowing us to avoid crowds and indoor spaces. That meant a 2,500-mile (4,000 km) road trip from southern California to southern Washington and back. We rushed up the faster inland route and took our time on the coast on the way down, for a total of 6 travel days and 2 work days.\n\nWe stayed in dumpy highway motels, cool restored workmen’s motels, nice ocean-view coastal motels, and a campground in the northern California redwoods. So, some extra gear for work and camping, but mainly just what we were going to travel and hike in. We had a heat wave on the way up, and apocalyptic wildfires on the way back. Keep reading to see how it all held up.\n\n### Gear: \n\n**Eddie Bauer Stowaway Packable 45L Duffle** ([https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/82300152/stowaway-packable-45l-duffel?sp=1&amp;color=Camo&amp;size=ONE%20SIZE](https://www.eddiebauer.com/p/82300152/stowaway-packable-45l-duffel?sp=1&amp;color=Camo&amp;size=ONE%20SIZE))\n\nI’ve yet to use the Tortuga Setout I bought just before Covid, but for road trips I prefer a duffle anyway. Easier to access and stack in the vehicle, and I only need to carry it from the car to my room or tent each night, nothing far. This EB one is a bargain (lists for $40, usually on sale for $20, available in several colors). The D-shaped opening (instead of straight zip) makes for easy access. It has a separate shoe compartment, which I use for storing dirty laundry instead. Since it’s stowable (in its own side pocket), it’s not very structured, but once packed everything stays in place pretty well. It’s made of polyester, so dirt brushes off; I doubt it’s very water resistant, though I haven’t tested. It’s durable: I’ve used it for a year on a half dozen camping trips and it still looks brand new. Have definitely got my $20 out of it. \n\n**Planetary Design Steel Toe French Press** ([https://planetarydesign.com/shop/steel-toe-with-bru-stop-clearance/](https://planetarydesign.com/shop/steel-toe-with-bru-stop-clearance/))\n\nI’m a huge fan of this French press coffee maker. Mine lives in my vehicle, in a tote bag with a Jetboil Zip, a 1L Nalgene of water, and a container of fresh ground beans so I can pull over and make coffee any time. The highlight of the Steel Toe is a double layer of mesh and a tight gasket, so way less grounds in the coffee than any other press I’ve used. The only drawback is that it doesn’t seal – there’s no way to close the sipper on top. I get around this by pouring straight into a mug or insulated bottle, but you can’t just toss it in your bag, you still need to deal with the grounds and remaining liquid or they can make a mess. They just released a new 2.0 version that has a locking closure, $33 list. Mine still looks new after a year and 50+ uses, so I’m just going to stick with it.\n\n### Clothing: \n\nI’m male, 5’10” (178cm), 185 pounds (84kg). A bit of a dad bod with wide shoulders, 34” waist (Euro 50) and 30” inseam (76cm). I’m either a medium or a large, depending on brand and cut.\n\nI didn’t wash, rinse, or launder anything on this trip. I hung everything (shirts, pants, underwear, socks) up in the hotel room for as long as I could, preferably near an open window for sun and breeze, but that wasn’t always an option. Then I folded it and put it back into my duffel if it still had life left. If not, it got stuffed in the shoe pouch of the duffel for the rest of the trip.\n\n**Off the Grid Surplus – Trailblazer Pro Pants – Taper Fit**  ([https://offthegridsurplus.com/products/trailblazer-pro-pants-charcoal](https://offthegridsurplus.com/products/trailblazer-pro-pants-charcoal))\n\nThese are like Prana Stretch Zion or Eddie Bauer Guide Pro pants but have more features than those and I’m liking these better. I got the Charcoal color, which is quite dark unless you put it up against some Slim Dungarees. The 34x30 fit very comfortably. They sit low on the waist but aren’t baggy in the crotch. The waist was a little snug at first, mainly because there’s no stretch there. The rest of the pant has lots of stretch, which keeps them snug but not constricting. Fabric weight is medium, and they breathe fine. They’re a little noisy but not the worst I’ve had. \n\nThey’ve got lots of features and pockets, but they all seem useful and not gimmicky. No zips on the back pockets, but small flaps keep stuff secure. The mag pockets on each hip are perfectly sized for a cell phone. Details are thoughtful and finish is excellent, equal to pants I own from Western Rise or Outlier (the fabric doesn’t feel equal to either of those, but the rest is). Definitely a value at $84.\n\nThese got a workout – after a pre-dawn boat ride, I hiked 6+ miles of sandy beach and off-trail scrub, climbed over algae-covered pilings, and sat on washed-up driftwood for lunch break. They were covered in sand and saltwater splash. I just brushed them off and hung them overnight before packing them up, and they were ready to go again 2 days later. Plus, they had a full road day on the way up. \n\n**Off the Grid Surplus – Thunderbolt Work/Trail/Travel Shirt – Long Sleeve – Dark Olive** ([https://offthegridsurplus.com/collections/mens-tops/products/thunderbolt-shop-trail-travel-shirt-long-sleeve](https://offthegridsurplus.com/collections/mens-tops/products/thunderbolt-shop-trail-travel-shirt-long-sleeve))\n\nThese guys are local to southern California and market to the overlanding crowd. The designer used to do stuff for Prana and other outdoor gear lines and it shows. I got the Thunderbolt in a large, which was spot on – perfect for my wide shoulders, sleeves just right, a little extra room in the body to move around. The fabric is a poly-cotton blend with a ripstop grid. It’s definitely thicker than the synthetic button-ups I usually wear hiking, but there’s no info on the actual fabric weight.\n\nThe Thunderbolt is pitched as a work shirt, so that’s how I tested it: early morning photography from the boat deck, coastal hiking with a full pack in 50-60˚ F (10-15˚ C). It did great in those conditions, though I think the heavy fabric weight will make it too warm for southern California use most of the year. It smelled a bit ripe at the end of the day, but that was after 8 hours of solid activity. It did better than some other synthetics I own, but it’s definitely not Merino-level odor-proof.\n\nLike the Trailblazer pants, the Thunderbolt shirt has a lot of features, but they work. Best is the venting down the full length of the back and the large external pocket on the back right, also vented. I tucked a water bottle in there for a bit, and while I probably wouldn’t use it like that often, it was accessible even with my pack on and it didn’t feel too uncomfortable. The shirt feels high quality, especially for $68, and I expect it to last a while, even with abuse from work. Also available in several other colors plus a short sleeve version.\n\n**Smartwool – Merino Sport 150 Polo** ([https://www.smartwool.com/shop/mens-merino-sport-150-polo-sw000372](https://www.smartwool.com/shop/mens-merino-sport-150-polo-sw000372)) \n\nThis was a real winner – it looks classy, with a standard polo cut but with prominent seams below the shoulder, and it performed very well. I’d worn this a few times before this trip, but not for any extended use. I got the medium, which is snug but not constricting. It’s a little looser than the same size Smartwool 100% merino hiking shirt I have. The polo is 58% merino/44% polyester, with barely any wool itch. It was comfortable to wear for dinner on the patio in Portland at 90˚ F (32˚ C), and for a cool morning on the coast at about 60˚ F (15˚ C). It also has a small lower side pocket with a zip; I didn’t use it much, but it wasn’t in the way. \n\nI got a lot of use out of this shirt on the trip, including a 9+ hour day of driving and two half days around town. I finally “killed” it during a hot humid hike through the redwoods while trying to keep up with my 15-years-younger co-worker. I could have worn it more if I had to, but it was ready for a wash at that point. There’s a tiny bit of pilling on the shoulders where my pack straps hit. No idea if it will affect durability and it’s barely visible, but it showed up after minimal use. I have a similar issue on a Stoic baselayer that’s 60% merino/40% polypropylene, so it may have something to do with the blend.\n\nThe polo retails for $80, but I picked it up on clearance at REI for $45 with a coupon. Definitely worth the discount price, probably worth full retail as long as the pilling doesn’t affect durability. I got the Bombay Brown Heather color which looks orange to me, maybe a little on the peach side. A t-shirt and hoodie are also available in the same fabric.\n\n**Lems – Boulder Boot - Vegan** ([https://www.lemsshoes.com/products/mens-boulder-boot-vegan?variant=31826357747770](https://www.lemsshoes.com/products/mens-boulder-boot-vegan?variant=31826357747770))\n\nThese things are amazing. They were my first non-hiking zero-drop shoes. I’ve worn them a bit over the last 6 months but just around town, never for work. I really didn’t want to lug heavy field boots along for this trip, but I honestly didn’t think the Lems would do very well in these conditions. I was worried the tread wouldn’t cope with the algae-covered rocks and that the nylon upper wouldn’t stand up to off-trail use. But I was gladly proven wrong: no problem with traction or durability.\n\nI love how light weight these are, how huge the toe box is, and how the nylon can just be hosed or brushed off. My calves were killing me after miles of sand hiking, but my feet felt fine. Highly recommended. They also come in leather and waterproof versions, and they just released a mid-height as well.\n\n[Lems Boulder Boots and Off the Grid Surplus Trailblazer Pro Pants](https://preview.redd.it/ensqtv3bqdp51.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e49406464c213d374828850d248a12d7d284f69)\n\n**Ridge Merino – Men’s Journey T-Shirt** ([https://www.ridgemerino.com/products/merino-wool-t-shirt-mens](https://www.ridgemerino.com/products/merino-wool-t-shirt-mens))\n\nThis was probably the star of the trip. I thought I “killed” this shirt on the first day of the trip: a full day in the car followed by a walk around downtown Sacramento and dinner outside in 110˚ F (43˚ C). But I hung it up in the hotel overnight and it was fine to wear around strangers the next night :). It was also fresh enough for another full day of use at the end of the trip.\n\nI got size M, which is snug but not constricting. I really like the longer length, because no one needs to see my belly when I reach for something. The fabric is 87% merino/13% nylon and is very thin at 145 gsm, which is great for southern California year-round use. I returned similar shirts by Chrome and Woolly because they were too thick and a little bit short. It’s not see-through, though, and is incredibly soft and itch-free. They have crew neck and V-neck options and six colors. The black is very deep, on par with my Outlier Slim Dungarees, and hasn’t faded with several washes (cold, line dry). Retail is $50 and worth it, but they’ve had a couple sales this year.\n\n### Next: \n\nI was planning to review more gear and clothing from the trip, including Birkenstock Arizona EVA sandals, Ridge Merino Boxer Briefs, the Bluffworks Field Jacket, and the Lochby Field Journal, but I keep getting delayed and wanted to get this out. If anyone’s interested, I’ll get those out soon. I also just got some new stuff that I’m breaking in, including the Western Rise AT Field Pant and Airlight short-sleeve shirt, Outlier Ramielust T-Shirt, and Flint &amp; Tinder Chore Coat.",
