It's a bit of an odd color system, but its mainly for visibility when looking down at the top of the bag while on a plane or in the car. With one zipper being a different color I can tell which side I'm about to pull. I was even able to turn an Alpaka Pencil Case Pro into a little boo-boo pouch that fit perfectly in the pocket with the red zipper. \n\nThis bag is an absolute tank. The price is kind of ridiculous but it that's what quality costs these days then so be it!",

        "selftext": "The Remote Equipment Alpha 31 is one the most versatile I’ve ever used, while also sporting some very cool looks. Similar to the ULA Ultra Dragonfly, the RE Alpha 31 is a bag that can nearly do it all if you only want 1 bag for every possible scenario.\n\nHere’s what we’re working with: \n\n&gt;Dual access main compartment, via the front panel-load opening U-Zip (just like the Dragonfly), or via the rolltop.  \n&gt;Utilizing both the compression straps and the adjustable roll-top, the bag capacity varies from ~25L to ~36L.  \n&gt;The bag in UVX40 weighs only 2lb 3oz with the frame sheet removed.  \n&gt;Tons of quick access space with the top pocket and dual front tubular pockets.  \n&gt;This UVX40 fabric looks and feels insanely cool, like something NASA invented for real. It looks like xpac and mylar had a baby.  \n&gt;UVX40 is waterproof + YKK aquaguard zips + rolltop make this a very weather resistant bag.  \n&gt;Two huge water bottle pockets (fit 1L nalgene).  \n&gt;Hydration bladder tube passthrough.  \n&gt;Trekking pole loops.  \n&gt;Laptop and tablet sleeve in the main compartment.  \n&gt;Laptop sleeve has a dedicated exterior zipper at the back.  \n&gt;Super comfortable harness is sporting ergonomic S-shaped straps with load lifters, heavily padded and well ventilated back panel. Internal frame sheet can be easily removed/reinstalled as you desire.",

        "selftext": "Just arrived and a grabbed clothes I still had packed from a work trip and shoved them in there then just kept grabbing stuff to fill it. Snapped a pic next to the Peak Travel Backpack 45L\n\nInitial thoughts:\n\n- I’m a large mammal and it felt a little small height wise, when not fully packed. It’s hard for a full size backpack not to look like a child’s backpack on me. However once I packed it all the way and added the side bags it seemed better.\n\n- I can already tell that this likely replace my Peak Everyday backpack. The ease of access with that front zipper is too fucking simple.\n\n- there are a lot of buckles and straps to pull but I found them all really intuitive. The adjustability is pretty amazing. \n\n- the side pouches go on super easy. I have the Mission Workshop Arkiv system and I loathe it, so difficult to add and remove… I can see myself buying more pouches for this bag  to quickly swap out.\n\n- it holds a lot more than I thought it would, it’s like a black hole. The area at the top easily seems to add another 10L or more.\n\n- knowing I can easily access stuff at the bottom by using the zipper means I can mindlessly stuff this thing rather than “strategically layer” like I do with other bags.\n\n- it grows in height rather than in depth when overstuffing, which is going to be great for travel. The Peak Travel grows depth wise and it makes it really awkward when navigating busy places, I knock into people constantly while turning.\n\n- Unlike the Peak Travel, when this is not overpacked it really becomes a smaller and more “discreet” bag.

        "selftext": "Just arrived and a grabbed clothes I still had packed from a work trip and shoved them in there then just kept grabbing stuff to fill it. Snapped a pic next to the Peak Travel Backpack 45L\n\nInitial thoughts:\n\n- I’m a large mammal and it felt a little small height wise, when not fully packed. It’s hard for a full size backpack not to look like a child’s backpack on me. However once I packed it all the way and added the side bags it seemed better.\n\n- I can already tell that this likely replace my Peak Everyday backpack. The ease of access with that front zipper is too fucking simple.\n\n- there are a lot of buckles and straps to pull but I found them all really intuitive. The adjustability is pretty amazing. \n\n- the side pouches go on super easy. I have the Mission Workshop Arkiv system and I loathe it, so difficult to add and remove… I can see myself buying more pouches for this bag  to quickly swap out.\n\n- it holds a lot more than I thought it would, it’s like a black hole. The area at the top easily seems to add another 10L or more.\n\n- knowing I can easily access stuff at the bottom by using the zipper means I can mindlessly stuff this thing rather than “strategically layer” like I do with other bags.\n\n- it grows in height rather than in depth when overstuffing, which is going to be great for travel. The Peak Travel grows depth wise and it makes it really awkward when navigating busy places, I knock into people constantly while turning.\n\n- Unlike the Peak Travel, when this is not overpacked it really becomes a smaller and more “discreet” bag.

As long as the product is well made then it’s a go for me. I have A/Bed some made in USA/ MIV Goruck packs, and honestly if you didn’t see the made in Vietnam label, you wouldn’t even know. I also think we can get in Vietnam definitely helped to keep the price down. Yes the higher shipping cost definitely came into play, but if they didn’t make it in Vietnam we definitely would been looking at a $450 pack. One of the reasons I always stayed away from the mission workshop (and the rake is a pack that I really think is hideous, but really love and wanna try) is that the astronomical price. Even on the used market they are crazy. Quality is also amazing, I still have my OG Chrome Metro (30l) from way back with the Bart and Mark.",

I believe the max capacity of this bag is 37l with the roll too maxed out. So I’ll also use this bag for travel or day trips into the city.

My first bags that utilize Ultra200TX.\n\nI don't love the strap that secures the rolltop (not sure what I'll end up doing with it) and will probably just end up tucking the rolltop into the outer stretch pocket as showing the photo I attached. IMO the strap is really only useful when the pack is totally full.",
