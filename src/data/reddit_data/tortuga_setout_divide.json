            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I‚Äôm a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I‚Äôm not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I‚Äôm finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn‚Äôt have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it‚Äôs easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It‚Äôs also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it‚Äôs in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it‚Äôs a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa‚Äôs is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it‚Äôs just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don‚Äôt think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn‚Äôt great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, ¬£ for ¬£ it is a better bag than the Allpa. ¬£60 vs ¬£220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more‚Ä¶\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I‚Äôm going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I‚Äôm not an expert in this area at all so it‚Äôs quite an unrefined review and there‚Äôs probably things I missed too!",

External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I‚Äôm not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I‚Äôm finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn‚Äôt have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it‚Äôs easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It‚Äôs also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it‚Äôs in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it‚Äôs a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa‚Äôs is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it‚Äôs just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don‚Äôt think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn‚Äôt great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, ¬£ for ¬£ it is a better bag than the Allpa. ¬£60 vs ¬£220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more‚Ä¶\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I‚Äôm going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I‚Äôm not an expert in this area at all so it‚Äôs quite an unrefined review and there‚Äôs probably things I missed too!",

        "selftext": "I‚Äôm planning on a RTW trip (from London to SE Asia / Australia by land and sea) next year, and am using a 3 week trip to Cuba in April as my practice run for Onebagging. \n\nI‚Äòve had my eye on the Cotopaxi Allpa 42L for a while but has been out of stock in the UK since I began searching. Yesterday it came back into stock and I pulled the trigger. However I had also coincidentally yesterday stumbled across this Decathlon Forclaz bag, at a much cheaper price (¬£220 vs ¬£59.99). I‚Äôm not an expert on these types of bags, but to me it felt like the Forclaz was aiming for a lot of things that the Allpa had (see link below). \n\nhttps://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/backpack-travel-500-organizer-40-l/_/R-p-338564?mc=8787845\n\nThey both have a clamshell opening, a small pocket at the top, a separate laptop compartment, a water bottle holder (the Forclaz holder also unzips to expand, and has a stretchy pocket on the other side too), the same 3 internal compartments and safety zippers. Some might say the Forclaz took a lot of inspiration from the Allpa‚Ä¶\n\nAnyway, I live very close to a large Decathlon and went to pick up the Forclaz yesterday. I‚Äôm yet to pack it properly but on first inspection it does look very promising for the price. \n\nThe Allpa should be arriving this week and I‚Äôll be comparing the two - I imagine the Allpa will feel slightly better, but whether it is ¬£160 better is another question! Updates to come‚Ä¶\n\nPictures attached.",

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I‚Äôm a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6.

            "body": "Allpa 42L vs Forclaz 40L side by side comparison:\n\n1. Size:\n\nAllpa: My first thought when opening the Allpa was that it looks a lot longer and wider than the Forclaz when basically the same weight.\n\nForclaz: It seems to be deeper which is where it gets the room \n\n2. Main packing pocket:\n\nSimilar set up. Again the Allpa pocket is a bit bigger, although the Forclaz seems a bit deeper. The Allpa also has has a very small side pocket within this pocket for valuables. The Allpa also has a long zip that means you can directly access this pocket from the outside if you need, although not entirely sure why you would need that regularly. The Forclaz does not have either feature.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n3. Packing pocket #2:\n\nBoth have a pocket about half the size of the main pocket on the other side, and both have an extra zip pocket on the front of the mesh for small items. The Forclaz pocket definitely feels deeper and I guess this is where it regains some ground on the length of the Allpa. \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n4. Packing pocket #3:\n\nThe Allpa pocket is very shallow - probably only able to store documents here.\n\nThe Forclaz pocket on the other hand is as deep as pocket #2, making it the perfect toiletries pocket. I‚Äôm a bit surprised at the almost pointlessness of the Allpa pocket #3.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n5. Internal zippers:\n\nThe Allpa definitely has better feeling zips - neither of them are as good quality as the outer zips obviously. Allpa is YKK and Forclaz is SBS.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n6. Overall internal appearance:\n\nThe Allpa does look more expensive than the Forclaz unsurprisingly and feels a bit more premium. \n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n7. External appearance:\n\nObviously the Cotopaxi is undeniably stylish, and I do like the colour way (Cavern). That said, I really like the orangey colour of the Forclaz and it does look a bit more traveller whereas the Cotopaxi maybe shouts tourist a bit more? Small margins though. I like the material of both and both come with a raincover.\n\nVerdict: DRAW\n\n8. External pockets:\n\nThe Allpa has a water bottle holder, but it does feel quite tight, and I‚Äôm not sure how much do space there would be when the bag is completely full.\n\nThe Forclaz has two external pockets - a water bottle pocket that can be unzipped to expand the pocket (using an elastic layer fabric to keep it in place), which is great. It also cuffed pocket on the other side made out of that same material  which would be useful for all sorts of stuff.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n9. External zippers:\n\nI really like both external zippers - both are heavy duty. I feel like the Forclaz is a bit easier to open and close but it might be that the Allpa YKK zippers just need warming up a bit?\n\nThe zipper for the main pockets on the Allpa has a security loop which I‚Äôm finding quite fiddly to get fully shut. The Forclaz doesn‚Äôt have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it‚Äôs easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It‚Äôs also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it‚Äôs in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it‚Äôs a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa‚Äôs is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it‚Äôs just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don‚Äôt think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn‚Äôt great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, ¬£ for ¬£ it is a better bag than the Allpa. ¬£60 vs ¬£220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more‚Ä¶\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I‚Äôm going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I‚Äôm not an expert in this area at all so it‚Äôs quite an unrefined review and there‚Äôs probably things I missed too!",

The Forclaz doesn‚Äôt have this loop but actually has a hole for a padlock to go through both zippers when together which is a neat feature \n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n10. Top pocket: \n\nThe Allpa has a really great top pocket. It feels really big and it‚Äôs easy to access (also has a less fiddly security loop). It‚Äôs also located on the far side of the bag. In the pocket, there are 3 cuffed slip in pockets, the main area, and then there is a zipped mesh pocket (which has two slip in pockets within that). A lot of space in here, and makes up for the internal pocket #3 being much smaller (it‚Äôs in the same space)\n\nThe Forclaz top pocket is on the back side of the bag, and is a lot smaller. It has a nice and easily workable security zipper. However, the Forclaz only has one general pocket with no extra compartments which is disappointing. Again it‚Äôs a trade off between this and pocket #3 inside. \n\nBoth have carabiners inside, but the allpa‚Äôs is more substantial.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA EASILY\n\n11. Laptop pocket:\n\nBoth have essentially the same size laptop pocket on the back side of the bag.\n\nForclaz: There is nothing extra to add here, it‚Äôs just a side pocket with no more features\n\nAllpa: The Allpa has two slip in pockets in this section - one large one with a Velcro strap, and a cuffed pocket (presumably for a charger). The pocket with the Velcro fits my iPad Air perfectly and it feels a lot more secure in there than in the Forclaz where it might be able to get knocked around a bit more due to the space it has.\n\nVerdict: ALLPA\n\n12. Extra pockets: \n\nThe Forclaz has an extra zipped pocket along the front of the bag which is well hidden, but looks like it could fit some handy extra things in there. The Allpa has no more pockets.\n\nVerdict: FORCLAZ\n\n13. Handles:\n\nAllpa: It has a detachable shoulder strap which looks nice and good quality - not sure how often it would be used though. It also has a side handle which seems fine\n\nForclaz: It has a handle at the top of the bag like a more traditional rucksack. No other handles\n\nVerdict: ALLPA, but minor win\n\n14. Straps: \n\nAllpa: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable, same with chest straps. I don‚Äôt think the hip straps were as comfortable as they could be but it might just need some adjusting when the bag is full. The hip strap is also removable with Velcro which is a good feature \n\nForclaz: Shoulder straps feel and look comfortable. Hip strap feels much better quality as the padding comes much further of the  way round, whereas the Allpa padding ends a lot sooner. It is not removeable however isn‚Äôt great\n\nVerdict: DRAW (removable hip strap Vs comfortable strap, tricky to decide)\n\n15. Value:\n\nClearly the Forclaz wins here, ¬£ for ¬£ it is a better bag than the Allpa. ¬£60 vs ¬£220, and the Allpa is not over 3 times better! The question is though, is it still worth paying more‚Ä¶\n\n16. Overall verdict: I DON‚ÄôT KNOW!! I was hoping when I had them side by side it would be clear which was the best option. The Forclaz feels better for the compartments internally, but the Allpa features like the top pocket and laptop pocket are real pluses. I‚Äôm going to need to fill them both up and have another think then.\n\nHopefully this was useful for people - I‚Äôm not an expert in this area at all so it‚Äôs quite an unrefined review and there‚Äôs probably things I missed too!",

            "body": "I don't think it's anywhere close, and the components/design are *significantly* different. The only similarities are that they're travel backpacks that use some sort of heathered fabric. \n\nIt uses the ripstop fabric that you see on the AmazonBasics packing cubes as a liner, the front compartment is much deeper so you'll either need to stuff it or lose space. There's no dedicated laptop compartment. No hip belt. \n\nStraps look flimsier and the overall shape is more similar to CabinZero. The internal compartments are reversed - big compartment has a big U-zip while the Setout Divide has the U-zip on the thinner outer half.\n\nWhen I was at a Target recently and gave it a once-over, I didn't like it... but my tastes have also gotten more expensive. If you need a travel bag of this form factor and can't spend more than $60, sure. Otherwise I'd point you toward a brand that's at least known for durability + quality like Timbuk2 or Osprey in the $100-ish range, or a simpler mid-capacity bag like a Jansport bag. \n\nI'll try to swing by if you're still interested, but for comfort on a traveling budget I'd personally recommend just using your work bag/backpack and grabbing a tote bag or a packable duffel for anything you can't fit.",

It's the same price and feels and looks a lot sturdier in build quality. I've used the Swiss bag for almost two years and it's by far my my favorite out of the ones they have there. It comes with a mesh compartment divider so you can separate clothes and notebooks from each other. Very convenient little bag on the side as well.\n\nIf you travel with a laptop and/or a student this bag is great since the back has some super intense support for the laptop on the back. Its' \"padding\" is one of the thickest I've seen in the game, really keeping your machine protected.

        "selftext": "Hi All! Seven years ago, I purchased the Tortuga setout divide (their expandable backpack). Detailed review of my first use here: https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/s/PORPEq34Kc\n\nThis backpack has been my trusted everyday carry, weekend and short work trip bag, and has just been an amazing backpack overall. I‚Äôve had to get her repaired once (the strap stitching became unraveled) and I‚Äôm convincing myself that I‚Äôm due for an upgrade.  \n\nI love every feature about this bag except it‚Äôs not great in the rain. \n\nDoes anyone have the updated Tortuga expandable bag and would you recommend? My main concern about it is the seemingly lack of space for Knick knacks (pens, business cards, lip gloss, etc). \n\nPhoto for attention of my setout divide for a current long work trip.",

The Expandable is definitely for a more modular packing style. I would get it for EDC. The one pocket that would have been a good thing to incorporate would have been one in the laptop compartment. It also bugs me that the side stash pocket doesn't face the side cary handle. Otherwise, I like it thus far.\n\nI have yet to take it on a trip. I have just done a few test loads.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HerOneBag/comments/15zms0j/trip_report_family_of_four_three_weeks_two/",
        "selftext": "We just got back from three weeks of travel with two adults and two kids, age 5.5 and 2.5. We went to the Big Island of Hawaii (7 days), New Zealand (10 days), and Sydney (5 days). We were mostly going for the World Cup, and decided to stop on Hawaii on the way. In Hawaii, we rented a car and did mostly beaches, small walks, and visiting friends. The weather went from hot and sunny by the coast to 50sF and raining in Volcano. In New Zealand, we drove around the north island in an RV, and the weather was in the 40s-50sF and raining. In Sydney, we were in a downtown apartment, and the weather was dry and beautiful (60s and 70s).\n\n[The whole set up- car seat bag and Setout both have passthroughs](https://preview.redd.it/yicifhnbjyjb1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4bcd977f317a8640986dce94e4eabcbd80b1dba)\n\nBags: Two carry on roller bags, one scooter suitcase, one backpack (Tortuga Setout Divide) + one expandable bag that came and went depending on how many snacks we needed\n\n* The rollers were both expandable, which I loved because in between flights, I could expand them and not have to play tetris. We also expanded and checked on to get all of our souvenirs home. All of our clothes went into one suitcase, and all of our shoes, puffy jackets, and gloves/ hats went into the other.\n* The scooter suitcase had the kids stuffed animals, toys, books, and some pull ups for the 2yo. It worked amazingly for the airports. We had some super long walks between terminals and to customs and passport, and the 5yo had no problem covering the distance. When she got tired, we would wheel her along. Highly recommend for international trips with this age group. It's not great as a suitcase, it didn't quite fit under the seat, and it's heavy, but it did exactly what we wanted it to. It also fit fine on top of the roller on the few occasions that 5yo did not want to ride.\n* The Setout goes from 26L to 34L. For flights, we kept it small so it would fit under the seat and hold tablets, headphones, and snacks. For walking around, it expanded big enough to fit jackets and gear for four people, including water bottles, change of clothes, snacks, hats and gloves, etc. It is big for a daypack but because the toddler sometimes ends up on my back, we need to have everything for four people in one bag.\n* Expandable bag might be the secret MVP. It's just a generic cheap one from craigslist, but it gave us a lot of flexibility and served as a smaller daypack when we didn't need the whole Setout.\n\nKid carrying gear: WayB Pico (2yo), RideSafer vest (2yo and 5yo), Mifolds booster for car seats (5yo), and Beco toddler carrier for the 2yo. I really wanted to have a car seat for the long plane flights, and I wanted to have a solution that could get both kids in taxis and fit in a daypack. We needed this for our city days and for when we took the kids to one of the games (taxi to the train). I picked up all four of these second hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[From the top right - Wayb, RideSafer, Beco, Mifolds](https://preview.redd.it/eg8pn7oziyjb1.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9ccdb0e5b65643f26f290fd0587b386dd8b5332)\n\n* The WayB Pico: portable but a real car option and worked well for the 2yo on flights. He was able to sleep on it about 50% of the time, and it kept him contained for awake time. We probably could have gotten by with just the Cares harness, but I'm don't think he would have been as comfortable. We also used it in the rental car in Hawaii, and I don't think I would do that again. It wasn't comfortable enough for a full week of driving. This might be just an us problem, but when the 2yo was in the WayB and the 5yo was in the RideSafer, they got way more wild and wiggly than they do in regular seats. I don't think this is coming on our next trip.\n* RideSafer vest: Love this thing. We use this in non-travel life for the 5yo when we need to taxi or car pool. For this trip, we used it in taxis for the 2.5 yo. He is officially too young for it, but he is well over the size requirements, and it worked fine when he was sitting next to an adult.\n* Mifolds booster: Used it in taxis for the 5yo. Generally, it doesn't feel as safe or secure as the vest, but it is lightweight and positioned the seat belt well enough.\n* Beco toddler carrier: 2 yo traveled in this on my back when his legs got tired. He is almost too heavy for me to carry (40lbs), but we got through the trip. It gave us a lot more range without being as bulky as a stroller. I can wear it around my waist and just throw him in when he needed.\n\n**Edited to add:** As some commenters have pointed out, car seat standards vary between countries, and these car seats are not officially certified for most places outside of the US. Some places have different rules for personal vehicles, rideshare/ taxis, and rental cars. New Zealand seems to accept US approved car seats (if I am understanding correctly), Australia does not, though the standards differ between regions. We choose to rent car seats with the RV, so that the kids were mostly in country-standard seats in New Zealand, and we did not rent a car in Australia. However, for our short taxi rides in both countries, we used the Mifolds and the Ridesafer vest that we brought. Other options would have been a) renting a car with car seats, b) buying car seats when we first arrived, c) using a local baby gear rental, or d) doing everything by public transportation. Always check your own car seats and the specific rules of the place that you're going. \n\nMy clothes: This set up worked great for me. I am never fashionable, but I felt like I had enough options and covered every situation that I needed. My husband's list looked very similar, and he was also fine.\n\n* 2x pants - jeans and comfortable black pants that look kind of dressy that feel like sweats\n* 3x bras - two sports bras (one doubles as swim top) and one regular\n* 1x skirt\n* 1x athletic long sleeve\n* 5x shirts\n* Running gear - 1x shorts, 1x leggings, 1x top, 1x long sleeve\n* Sweater\n* Bathing suit bottom\n* Underwear, socks\n\nKids clothes (for each child): This was not enough clothes for them. It was fine in Hawaii, but in New Zealand, they got muddy and wet instantly. We needed about three more pairs of pants and another long sleeve shirt for each. As it was, we did a lot of laundry.\n\n* 5x Short sleeve\n* 3x Pants\n* 3x Shorts\n* 2x Long sleeves\n* 5x Underwear\n* 4x Socks - wool, regular\n* 1x PJs (1)\n* 1x bathing suit\n* Rain pants\n\nOn top of those lists, all of us had a puffy jacket, a rain jacket, a hat, and a pair of gloves. We also each had sneakers, boots, and a pair of either sandals (grown ups) or crocs (kids). The 12 (!) pairs of shoes took up so much space, however, we needed all of them. Hawaii was summer, and we were on the beach. New Zealand was cold, rainy, and muddy. I am glad that we took every one of them. We also chose to wear sneakers on the plane for comfort, so we had to fit the boots into the suitcase. In Hawaii, we had one suitcase with all winter gear that just stayed in the car for the week, but in New Zealand, we used it all. I was please with our outerwear set up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Everyone gets a packing cube.](https://preview.redd.it/19iigvuhjyjb1.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef441119ee7b48556b8d30cb6f38a816f2bfb69d)\n\n[The clothes bag](https://preview.redd.it/pga1t4rjjyjb1.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32965c6b7de64af9139b341c3cc6c9ff1f46e719)\n\n[The ridiculous shoe bag. Puffy jackets fit on top in a compression sack.](https://preview.redd.it/gaonocvkjyjb1.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bac5b479fdb24858c9fb084a5ba6bb0d8f46739)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n* We had an ipad for each kid, and they were crucial for the long flights. They had some games, but they also had their reading apps, which was great - there's no way we could have packed three weeks of books.\n* I packed two collapsible plates and sets of fork/ knife/ spoon, and we used them all the time for dividing snacks and eating on the go. They take up space, but were well worth it.\n* We acquired and gave away some toys and craft supplies as we went and were generous about letting the kids pick out coloring books. Total amount of kid toys stuff stayed constant and fit in the scooter suitcase. Balloons are a great thing to pack.\n* 2yo is potty trained during the day and just does pull ups at night. This list would be different if he was still in diapers. He also sleeps in a regular bed, so we didn't have to worry about cribs or packnplays.\n* Kids toiletries fit in with mine - basically just toothbrushes and toothpaste - so my husband and I each had one of these: [https://www.rei.com/product/870260/arcteryx-index-dopp-toiletry-kit](https://www.rei.com/product/870260/arcteryx-index-dopp-toiletry-kit)\n* Bandaids and a small pill organizer were used a lot. We brought basic meds like dramamine, asprin, ibprofen, etc, and it was nice to not have to try to find things.\n* I had planned to buy some clothes along the way, for myself and the kids, but shopping in New Zealand with the RV and the kids was harder than expected. In the future, I'll just plan to bring everything.\n* USA team kit - never used :-(\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

We had never done an RV trip before, so it was an experience for us. We rented a fairly large one, and the driving experience was not good. It was loud, slow, and made us all car sick. The kid's car seats were next to each other and in front of a table, and when they dropped things, we would have to stop to retrieve them (cue screaming). The roads are windy and hilly. We weren't comfortable driving or parking in the towns or cities. I did appreciate not having to pack/ unpack every day, but with the RV, we had to secure everything anyway, so minimal advantage there.\n\nThe holiday parks were nice (we used the Top 10 chain), but they all have cabins for rent, so we could have still done them and just driven a regular car. We ended up returning it early and getting an apartment in Auckland instead of staying in the RV in the area. If you're an experienced RV-er or just 1-2 adults in a camper van, it would probably be a different experience.",

        "selftext": "I just got back from a quick couple of rainy days in Amsterdam, figured I'd share my feedback on the new Thule Landmark series of bags and how the 70 liter in particular worked out for me last weekend.\n\nThe Landmark bags are available in a:\n\n40 liter (one 40L duffel bag with a built-in laptop compartment)\n\n60 liter (dual bag system = one 40L duffel bag with no laptop compartment that clips into a 20L daypack)\n\n70 liter (dual bag system = one 50L duffel bag with no laptop compartment that clips into a 20L daypack)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[70 Liter Landmark = 20L Daypack + 50L Main Duffel](https://preview.redd.it/lnr9jkipg7n21.png?width=3386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d30f7b16d873a10f1081b9693773aadd3d68f95)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did some video to go along with this writeup:\n\n[https://youtu.be/4X2KASvbZf8](https://youtu.be/4X2KASvbZf8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw these bags last year at the Outdoor Retailer trade show, but at the time I didn't pay too much attention. I was *relatively* happy with my Osprey Ozone 46, Porter 46, Arc'teryx Khard and Blade, and another bag I was using at the time, but kinda wanted them to have a baby and mix some features of each.\n\nBy the time the Consumer Electronics Show rolled around, and I sniffed the Landmarks again at their CES booth. I was impressed enough that figured I should buy one and give it a jaunt to see how it did. I got it from eBags, used a coupon, and got what I felt was a pretty fair deal on it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst points: I only travel with a carry on if I can help it, so going with the Landmark 70L was a bit of a risk: It's specs show it as *over* carry on size on most airlines. However, as you'll see in my video, I stuck it in four different airlines bag-limit sizers, and it fit. Admittedly, it was 3/4 full, so I could squish it down. I suppose I could have overstuffed a 60L, or understuffed a 70L with similar results.\n\n[Not a carry on size? We'll see about that!](https://preview.redd.it/7skz8e0zh7n21.png?width=2980&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aab6f7c53a79143f1e4e7959c229857770ee33d)\n\nThe 20L daypack also easily fits into the \"personal item\" sizer:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llokz5kcg7n21.png?width=3818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=797781d2c9aa3809d33ea58410d5bfd1862b9a40\n\nOn that note, the 70 (which is a 50L main bag + a 20L daypack system) is a little lumpy and sloshy when it's not full. You can tell this is one of those bags where, for sales photos, they're going to have it stuffed to the max with pillows to give it a nice clean shape... but when you get it home, it's floppy and unkempt.\n\nIt's not BAD, but it does have some extra lumpiness if it's not crammed full. I also wish it had some very thin foam like the Porter or Peak Travel bags to give it structure and hold it open when you pack it. I hate how bags collapse when you're packing them. I mean, it's not anywhere near as bad as the Patagonia MLC, which is a soft blob of a bag where all your stuff slides down to the bottom and shifts around as you walk, hurting your back. Conversely, form and rigidity is not as good as a Porter 46 with its foam compression wings, but then again, it's got more useful space than the Porter. The Porter wastes too much space and weight with laptop foam and too much side foam. I don't travel with a laptop often, and when I do, I just sandwich it between some fleece or pants and it's never been a problem.\n\nBecause of this unkemptness/floppiness, I was initially disappointed with it, but after loading it up and carrying it around, I really liked the way it sat on my back - great support, straps and hipbelt worked better than anything else in my quiver. I'm 6'2\" and hip belts either squish my gut (yeah, yeah) or sit way too high just below my ribs. This fit like I suspect hip belts have always supposed to fit me but never did.   :)\n\nHip belts! Arg. Con area: The 40L and the 60L fold up and tuck inside the rear panel. But the 70L... it's got that flap that goes over the whole straps/belts, so someone decided the belt tucking away was redundant. BUT IT'S NOT. There's times I prefer not to wear the hip belt. There's times I carry the bag by the side handle and don't want the hip belt flapping around. So your choices are apparently \"wear the belt\" or \"have it dangle\".\n\nPro area: The top Safe Zone turtle-top hardshell compartment is a nice touch. I'd stick sunglasses and a phone in there, small camera, etc. and not worry about it getting squished. At first, it seemed like not enough organization, but I like just a few pockets that are useful rather than a sea of little gimmick pockets that lose your stuff or it all falls out when the bag is tipped. Thule did this well, with a good compromise of minimal and useful.\n\nSame with the little passport-cash safe pockets on the large and daypack bags. Nice feature, clean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, this series is so-close to really good, but is also a bunch of catch-22's for me: I think if I was to do it again, I'd get the 60L, because it's got the tuck-away hip belt and is a little trimmer. Oh - but the Men's 40L and 60L doesn't have the load lifters. But the women's 40L and 60L *do*?  WHY? Arg. Why can't the Landmark series all have load lifters? Why does one's hipbelt tuck away, but not on all of them? Why does the 70L have sewn in straps, whereas the others are buckled in? Maybe these aren't big deals, but they're annoying choices I don't want to make. We're all in this looking for the perfect bag with all the features, not trying to make tradeoffs!  :)\n\nI think I'll keep this bag, it's too nice to get rid of, especially at the price, but I'm interested in comparing it to the much pricier Peak travel bag. I have grown annoyed at the Porter 46 for having too much padding and features I don't use (too much organization and wasted space/weight on laptop compartment), so I am drawn towards the Landmark 60 and 70 not requiring you to have the laptop compartment.\n\n[Those load lifters on the 70L!](https://preview.redd.it/oz6cv3nhg7n21.png?width=3262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee8f028593f04ec939e917606207f1b3eb35c30f)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL/DR: It's a good bag. Fantastic support, belt and straps. It fits me very well. Happy-medium weight. Looks well constructed and durable. Stylish if it's chock full, lumpy and shifty if not. Hardshell top is a nice feature. Good compromise between organization and lots of open space. Good price for what you're getting.\n\nAsk questions, check the video, I'll answer to best ability!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/f9t22p/i_think_ive_almost_found_my_perfect_travel/",
        "selftext": "Hello, one-bag community,\n\nHere's a quick review of a [cheap but very good backpack](https://i.imgur.com/pNALdAX.jpg) I've bought on AliExpress for $35. \n\nUnfortunately, the backpack has been removed from the AliExpress website by the seller. Here is an alternative seller who sell the same bag for around the same price [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33061571035.html](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/33061571035.html)\n\n## Usage\n\nFor context, I am a location independent web developer (digital nomad is the trendy term), that's mean I work in co-working places, libraries, and caf√© during my trips.\n\nI'm not entirely nomad, I have a house in France. I just travel a lot.\n\nI haven't used this backpack a lot yet (3/4 times) because I prefer to use [my smaller Naturehike backpack](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/f46k8m/naturehike_laptop_backpack_review_mystery_ranch/) for short trips and I don't actually travel for more than 3-4 days but my first impressions are very good!\n\n## The bag\n\nIt's a 30 L scalable backpack : 44 x 29 x 14(24)cm. It's expandable from around 18L to around 31L.\n\nThe style is simple and \"business-ish\".\n\nAs you should have guessed from the low price, the fabric of the backpack is oxford polyester with a water repellent treatment.\n\nAs it's usually the case in most of the Chinese backpacks, there is an external USB port (useless in my case).\n\nThe backpack is a bit similar to the AER Travel pack (front pocket with organization, main clamshell pocket and laptop compartment on the back) with a Minaal carry-on touch (less bulky and fluffier). I haven't owned a Tortuga Setout divide but I think this Tortuga bag is the same idea than the one I've bought.\n\nYou can use the backpack as a classic backpack or as a hand luggage thanks to the 2 side handles.\n\nI previously owned an AER Travel pack and the Ozuko small knockoff of this bag but the problem with these bags is they are too heavy (1.8 kg for the classic version and 1.5 kg for the small version). Contrary to AER Travel Pack and its knockoffs I have owned, this bag is lightweight (only 1kg).\n\nThe bag is available in 2 colors: black or gray.\n\n## Backpack organization\n\nThe bag has 2 small pockets on the front: one horizontally and one vertically.\n\nThe front pocket is the \"office pocket\" with the organization inside. Note that the pockets inside are very thin and don't seem to be robust. The front pocket is the pocket I use when I use this backpack as a daypack to go to caf√©s, libraries, coworking...\n\nThen there is the main pocket (\"the clothing pocket\") that opens like a clamshell. That is the expandable pocket. When the bag is not expanded, this pocket is very thin and can't really be used. But that's not a problem because the other pockets are accessible when the bag is retracted.\n\nOn the back of the bag, there is the laptop compartment that can carry a 15,6\" laptop and a tablet (or in my case, my 12,5\" external monitor).\n\nThere is a sternum strap on the straps of the backpack.\n\nThere is a fixing belt for luggage on the back of the backpack. Because we are all one bagging here, you should think it's useless. But it can be used to remove the straps and fix them to carry the bag as a business bag.\n\nThe bag I received is a bit different than the bag shown on the Aliexpress website. The front pockets are perpendicular and the backpack has no brand.\n\nHere are my real pictures of the backpack to have a closer look on the backpack: https://imgur.com/a/UkNZn2F\n\n## Cons\n\nThis bag hasn't water pockets. That's why I use a [memo bottle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33027527390.html) or a [Vapur water bottle](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32970675316.html) I put inside the front pocket. Of course, the quality is quite good but not as solid as my previous AER Travel Pack for example.\n\n## To conclude\n\nThis generic backpack is very good. It's not a knockoff but its organization is similar to the AER Travel Pack. The style is more business than urban because it can be used as hand luggage too. It's also expandable.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nIf you like this style of bag, here are some interesting alternatives I've found on the AliExpress website. The quality seems better than the bag I own, but prices are higher and these bags are heavier.\n\n- [Ozuko](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000275775935.html) : $50 / 32x17x48cm / 1.2kg. It looks like an enhanced version of my backpack. My knockoff of the AER Travel Pack was from this brand. I haven't bought it but I recommend you to check this backpack instead of the one I own.\n- [Artic Hunter](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000143644627.html) : $45 / 30x15x43 cm / 1.5kg\n\nThere are many reviews of expansive backpacks on this subreddit. But if you can't/don't want/whatever use a lot of money for a backpack, there are more and more possibilities for you to use a good travel backpack and have a nice trip :)",
