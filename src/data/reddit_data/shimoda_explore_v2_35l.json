        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

The 2-Day isn’t a light bag itself. This definitely carries weight more comfortably for me, though. \n\nOne other note in comparison to the 2-Day: Since the top doesn’t have the tri-zip closure, it does take a few extra moments to access the interior compartment. I don’t mind this because I like the form factor better.",

The pockets on the blitz seem deep in comparison. I wasn’t worried at all about losing my Yeti bottle. I haven’t done a side-by-side on them, but these seem better. They are still wide, so I suspect I might want something to help keep my umbrella from sliding around, though I don’t think it’ll want to fall out. \n\nRegarding access, I have a Shimoda Action X30 that gets a lot of use right now for hiking with cameras. It is sort of a one-trick pony, though. It excels at carrying photo gear in a safe and still accessible way, but it is pretty meh for my other needs on a day hike. If you are looking for a great photo backpack, I can recommend that one (or its bigger sibling) strongly. \n\nThe access to gear in this pack seems like it will work well for me in many situations. I like ruck-style sack packs for lots of things, but they wouldn’t necessarily be my first choice for a dedicated photo pack. However, the full-height zip access here makes it work in more scenarios. I don’t know if it will replace my Shimoda for photo-gear-heavy day hikes, but it definitely could.",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

The 2-Day isn’t a light bag itself. This definitely carries weight more comfortably for me, though. \n\nOne other note in comparison to the 2-Day: Since the top doesn’t have the tri-zip closure, it does take a few extra moments to access the interior compartment. I don’t mind this because I like the form factor better.",

                "body": "I had the same issue with the bottle pockets in my 2-Day. I made elastic keepers and had a mini carabiner to help secure my small umbrella when I needed it. The pockets on the blitz seem deep in comparison. I wasn’t worried at all about losing my Yeti bottle. I haven’t done a side-by-side on them, but these seem better. They are still wide, so I suspect I might want something to help keep my umbrella from sliding around, though I don’t think it’ll want to fall out. \n\nRegarding access, I have a Shimoda Action X30 that gets a lot of use right now for hiking with cameras. It is sort of a one-trick pony, though. It excels at carrying photo gear in a safe and still accessible way, but it is pretty meh for my other needs on a day hike. If you are looking for a great photo backpack, I can recommend that one (or its bigger sibling) strongly. \n\nThe access to gear in this pack seems like it will work well for me in many situations. I like ruck-style sack packs for lots of things, but they wouldn’t necessarily be my first choice for a dedicated photo pack. However, the full-height zip access here makes it work in more scenarios. I don’t know if it will replace my Shimoda for photo-gear-heavy day hikes, but it definitely could.",

The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

They are still wide, so I suspect I might want something to help keep my umbrella from sliding around, though I don’t think it’ll want to fall out. \n\nRegarding access, I have a Shimoda Action X30 that gets a lot of use right now for hiking with cameras. It is sort of a one-trick pony, though. It excels at carrying photo gear in a safe and still accessible way, but it is pretty meh for my other needs on a day hike.

I like ruck-style sack packs for lots of things, but they wouldn’t necessarily be my first choice for a dedicated photo pack. However, the full-height zip access here makes it work in more scenarios.

The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them.

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3). Thank you for the comprehensive review. May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front.

I also have been using my 2DAP to carry my camera gear as a professional photographer so I'm interested in this as a possibility to carry more gear (was otherwise thinking of the AER TP3).

May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

May I ask how do you find access and organisation inside the main compartment vs the 2dap? \n\nI do wonder if there's still any possibility to use a beaver tail with the new admin compartment in front.\n\nHave they improved on the water bottle pocket? My main gripe with the 2dap side pockets are that they are somehow too shallow for big water bottles (I carry 40oz hydro flasks) but also too wide for smaller items like umbrella, meaning all these things just fall out unless I use a carabiner to clip them to the PALS webbing...\n\nDoes the laptop compartment still have a separate external zipper for easy accessibility?\n\nAlso is the weight increase of the bigger bag noticeable?\n\nThanks again for sharing!!!",

        "selftext": "Hi all. I posted a little while back asking if anyone had hands on the new Mystery Ranch Blitz 35. Nobody had, but a few people expressed interest in seeing it if I got one. \n\nI ended up ordering one in Large via REI. They actually had the black in stock (MR did not at the time), and we had some dividend bucks there, so I got the pack for less than half of retail out of pocket. Thanks, REI! The bag arrived a couple of days before we left for vacation to an out of the way spot in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, so I loaded it up and took a few accessories to set up different configurations for various activities, and we set off for a 10+ hour drive. \n\nThis isn’t my first MR bag (I also have the 2-Day). Build quality, as expected, looks awesome. My pack doesn’t show any fraying fabric ends, stray threads, etc. Hardware all seems to be of excellent quality and well chosen for the task. Unlike the 2-Day, I was happy to see Velcro strap keepers on almost all straps. They are not on the lid straps nor the shoulder straps. Zippers are all weather-resistant. \n\nI like the configuration of the compression straps. The ones on the bottom have plenty of room to strap a bedroll or other gear. I especially like the strap inside the middle of the main compartment. That really helps to hold the upper part of the bag in good shape, especially when the front pockets have items in them. \n\nThe padded waist belt provides good support, and it is big enough for my huge self. Both sides include a zipper pocket on the hip pad. The belt is completely removable, thanks to gate clips on each side. \n\nThe exterior pockets have good volume to them. The two front pockets have organizing pockets in the back. The upper pocket includes a key lanyard. The lower pocket includes elastic bands inside the front panel. The organizers all fold back flat, so using your own pouches works well, as I have done here. The side bottle pockets have firm elastic, and they are big enough for even larger format bottles, like the 36oz. Yeti in the photos. \n\nThe interior has a generous laptop/hydration sleeve, plus a tablet sleeve in front of it. There are also long wand pockets to each side. \n\nThe 35 has two levels of sack drawstring closure, plus a buckle that secures a full-height zipper, for open access to the main compartment. There is a matching zipper on the opposite side that opens to a hidden-ish lined pocket in the front panel. There is also a side zipper to access the laptop/hydration sleeve without opening the main compartment. \n\nThe lid has a generous dump pocket, and secures with two straps on the front. I’m a huge fan of this configuration on a bag. \n\nOn this trip, the bag was used to transport electronics on the drive, then it was put to use as a larger daypack for some outings where we wanted to bring more than we wanted to hand carry, and also as a day hiking photo pack, carrying camera, multiple lenses, tripod, and associated gear, plus hydration. \n\nSo far, this pack is everything I was looking for, though my use of it is still just beginning. Feel free to ask any question you might have!",

I'm a hobby photographer and would like to share my setup with you guys and fellow photographers for inspiration!\n\nWhat I'll bring with me:\n\n* Peak design packing cube small with:\n- 2 t-shirt \n- 1 long sleeve shirt\n- 3 pair of socks\n- 3 underwear \n\n* Toiletry kit:\n- Philips oneblade \n- small toothbrush\n- toothpaste \n- toothpicks\n- perfume \n- deodorant stick\n\n* Tech:\n- Canon EOS R \n- Canon RF 24-240 allround lens \n- Hama 10.000 mAh powerbank \n- USB A to USB C cable\n- USB C to USB C cable\n- AirPods Pro \n- lightning cable\n- Canon LPE6 battery spare\n\n* Miscellaneous:\n- mini umbrella \n- warm hat for cold weather \n- little pink bag for games\n- 2 sunglasses in the case\n\nThat's basically my kit for the few days I'll be in Milan.\n\nI'm curious what you think of it! If you have any questions about the backpack and/or the gear from the packing list, feel free to ask! Cheers.",

In Japan a bus driver said \"everything\" goes in the lower luggage compartments, no exceptions.  Some kind of safety rule and I was not prepared to argue in Japanese.\n\nI generally keep everything in hard pelican brand cases.   \n\n  \nOnce me and one other guy were making a video for a white water raft company.  This was year ago when the gear was huge and filled two cases plus the tripod.    We went 2 hours ahead in an open canoe, so we could set up and wait for the comany's rafts.  We dumped the canoe and the cases took a swim through some white water and rocks.   We swam it all to shore and opened up the cases and set up the shot.      Same when I did underwater work.    SOme one is always going to drop a tank or some wet stuff soaking on saltware on you stuff.   But if it is in a hard case, I don't care.   The routine was always to rinse the case with fresh water BEFORE you open it EVERY time,  Dive boats always have a large tub of fresh water just for this purpose",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1icqqkr/review_pgytech_onemo_travel_backpack_35l_peak/",
        "selftext": "# My OneBag History\n\nI have been hanging around this sub-reddit since 2018, I travel often for photography and work and always try to go with OneBag way. You can check my recent [20L](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1fb063g/6_days_in_japan_sub5kg_osprey_daylite_totepack_20l/) and [22L setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1gjajyp/photography_trip_to_busan_pgytech_onemo_lite_22l/) posts.\n\n# Who is PGYTech?\n\nPGYTech is a smaller Chinese company, positioned as a premium photography accessories manufacturer, a local alternative to international brands such as Peak Design, Wandrd or Shimoda.\n\nWhile their presence on the international market is not as strong as the other named brands and they aren’t covered as much by your typical bags or photography Youtubers, PGYTech is already a well-established brand and available at photography retailers around the World.\n\n# Concept of OneMo Travel Backpack\n\nOfficial Website with more photos and full specification: [https://www.pgytech.com/products/onemo-travel-backpack](https://www.pgytech.com/products/onemo-travel-backpack)\n\nWhen I first heard that PGYTech was preparing a travel/camera backpack, I assumed they would go after the popular Peak Design 30L/45L travel backpacks, taking previous PGY camera backpacks and adding some travel-focused details.\n\nBut what they finally revealed in July 2024 was something much stranger.\n\nPresented as this three-in-one multifunctional bag - backpack, duffel and giant shoulder bag, with 35L base capacity and floppy 15L expendable front section, I couldn’t wrap my head around it. Combining elements that go against each other, trying to be the bag for everything, yet not really a bag for anyone in particular.\n\nOneMo differs significantly from any of the Peak Design offerings, not as direct as PD travel backpacks, not as plain as PD duffel. After some time with it, I would actually compare it more to something like an Osprey Farpoint, just with additional camera side access and some useless extra flappy bits.\n\n \n\n**Note on Size and Weight**\n\nYes, it’s a big and heavy backpack, at 35L+ and 2kg. Nothing for fans of personal items or for people who worry about weight limits. But considering how many people travel around with Peak Design 45L that matches these specifications, it’s nothing that outrageous.\n\n \n\n# The Good\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1tu51iorwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bbda9a4bbaf54480bbdcddc269a5213febd9629\n\nI always liked the comfort on my OneMo Lite 22L and the OneMo Travel pushes it even further. More robust and longer shoulder straps nicely hug my chest even with heavy load and the backpanel combines decent mesh padding with a stiffer construction, giving the bag needed structure, while being less rigid than normal PGYTech camera bags.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08hi764fswfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f332b3efabf22b7edf58f3ef75a58c6ad58b0853\n\nLeft shoulder strap includes an additional thick strap with two sections for mounting camera carry systems, but I found it to be also a good spot for attaching a strap pouch. It might not be the most elegant solution and it can feel a bit “tacticool”, but it’s a good option for keeping quick access to passports, tickets and earphones without the need to add a sling to your setup.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ptb76zdswfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9651ed24abc566cc7a3cc26fd37a067078e1b0e5\n\nThe floppy pocket in the main 35L compartment is something I was doubtful about, but it actually served me well. Accessible from the top only, it’s a sort of deep “throw-in-whatever” section and place where I keep anything I will need to bring out during security check (Smaller Camera cube, bag with liquids, bag with film rolls, etc). The zippered pocket at its top is also a decent spot for wallet – protected by two zippers, yet easily accessible,\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wk94jgzbswfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59ee0c7f3105177de6f6f4dfdc350bd411d84ce9\n\nInner pocket on the camera access door is massive, reaching over 35cm in length. I’m using it instead of a tech pouch, as it safely fits multiple cables, chargers, extra batteries, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y30d3fmaswfe1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b17b64ef76d5b93b823d91640abf721428fbfa55\n\nBoth the side access and top pocket offer simple theft deterrents, with small loops through which you can guide the U-shaped zipper pull and effectively securing them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pcdekgf9swfe1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c48a3938ec0e72544f687a1c389c021e2bd55a3a\n\nThere is no such loop for zippers on the main compartment, but a basic solution is a lockable S-clip on one of the external loops.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/63b83a78swfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43f68a9faf06117e5b5437f1c7091f14d14c1186\n\nWater bottle pocket on this PGYTech is massive. It swallows a normal 500ml bottle, nicely fits travel tripods and can be also a good spot for thinner sandals or barefoot shoes.\n\n \n\n# The Questionable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hpy1xs56swfe1.jpg?width=1919&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7aa683fb9d56640362fef0e0eef7b1b31325054a\n\nFor some reason, the bag uses a fairly small #5 YKK zipper on its main compartment. Considering this zipper is the only thing that connects the carry system to the massive backpack, it feels like a possible weak link. It’s an especially puzzling decision, since the smaller PGYTech 22L Lite actually uses sturdier #8 YKK for this part…\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8wsc2u3swfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c7a2057d76c0e5e32faf045e6d3246e93a6ad3e\n\nThe front expandable section was maybe my biggest question when purchasing this bag, being unsure how much I will use it or hate it. So far it’s been mixed.\n\nI love it for short-term storage of extra layers. Since I now mainly use this backpack for travelling to colder places, this space is so great for putting away my bulky jacket at airports or when I return to my sub-tropical home climate.\n\nAt the same time, I dislike that the two inner pockets are pretty much useless, since they are so hard to reach. They are hidden behind a long main zipper and two buckles, getting to them always means laying down the bag and taking way too much space, simply too annoying for something that should be quick access.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m5fv1kfyrwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a5fd7a0973a2752cb2ea1db833d89d5360dfa8e\n\nThe front expendable section is held in place by buckles at the top and bottom of the backpack, but somehow, each is done in a different way!\n\nOn the top, buckle is connected to the top wall, away from the two zippers and not blocking access at all. The strap can sometimes cover them, but I don’t mind that. And this place is nice if you want to quickly secure your sweatshirt on top of the backpack.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kjxmv6uwrwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d97018bf2b6fb1efc4b8bff1b369ffb65a19661\n\nBut on the bottom, the buckle is connected to the backpanel and you need to unbuckle it any time you want to open the main compartment!\n\nI don’t know which of these two solutions I prefer, but the fact that the top and bottom use different solutions just drives me insane every time I try to open the main pocket and forget the bottom buckle.\n\nTo push this design decision to even further madness, you are unable to hide away the backpack straps unless you unbuckle the bottom buckle! But only the bottom buckle….\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rwyef8hvrwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ecae4fa08d0c31e5933f681188f3f1b53cadce1\n\nOne smaller thing for the top buckle. When the front section is filled, the top buckle starts pulling on the top zipper leading to the inner pocket. Adding more strain to this #5 YKK zipper and making it a bit harder to open or close the top pocket.\n\n \n\n# The Useless\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mxjtsxtrwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09d8b3f798a70edefa58a688eb9e50dca88c6e73\n\nI knew I would never use this bag as a shoulder bag, but for some time I kept pondering about its duffel mode. But after a few trips I decided this mode was also useless and I cut off the duffel straps! I didn’t want to deal with hiding away the shoulder straps. The fact I couldn’t keep the bottom buckle in place made the front pocket seem floppy and the bag overall looked bigger. And the duffel straps simply took away useful space from the side pockets.\n\nSo it was time for sharp scissors.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjctsfhsrwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2001b8fdae665b2a7497b18d5e6f9d3e3e5a3b\n\nThese two small straps on the laptop pocket are a very inelegant solution for a niche problem – keeping the camera cube lid open when opening the bag.\n\nDon’t need them, it’s time for scissors again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oc5uyrerrwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e546fcc1c543c6f1150041a8e9bcc3a81424a5a\n\n \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7ai7y1qrwfe1.jpg?width=1441&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0eac51e271339820700636c6c670ec18af94888\n\nThere are four of these external loops at the front of the bag and while I know they can be useful in some situations, they make sure the zippers to side pockets get stuck on them at minimum 50% of the time!\n\nSo far I haven’t taken scissors to them, yet!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis bag is such a mix of emotions for me, because it feels like it could be an absolutely great travel backpack, just if PGYTech could calm down a bit and simply make a backpack, not a multi-functional mess.\n\nThe overall build, materials, and comfort are just excellent. The inner organization perfectly matches my needs, a water bottle pocket like this should be on all bags and I honestly like its green look.\n\nGet rid of the duffel straps, sort out your buckles and maybe skip the expendable section and do a basic front pocket. Please make a simple 35L backpack and I would be set for years.",
