            "body": "**The Walker 24** is a fun, casual and surprisingly thoughtful 24-liter daypack from an old German company called Deuter. Deuter specializes in hiking and cycling bags but they also make casual daypacks in different styles.\n\nUnlike most Deuter bags, the Walker 24 has a  heritage style with some really modern elements, like their incredible and quite unique Airstripes back panel (more on that later)\n\nThe Walker 24 comes in a variety of different colors. You can choose something more subtle like the marine-ink (dark blue) or go completely dark with the graphite-black (dark grey with black bottom). But you can also choose brighter colors like red or yellow, which is pretty much what mine is, although Deuter calls my colorway caramel-clay.\n\nMy favorite color for sure is actually the [khaki-lion](https://www.speck-sports.com/52374-thickbox_default/backpack-deuter-walker-24-khaki--lion.jpg) but sadly it’s either out of production or just out of stock for now. The caramel-clay looks ultimately like mustard to me - it’s not really a bright yellow, I would say it’s more earthy, darker yellow. The color actually looks really different depending on the light, in fact even if you look through the photos I took of my pack, the color looks kinda different depending on the picture. It’s a nice color for sure, summery and cheery but not too aggressively yellow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Size**\n\nThe Walker backpack is available in two different sizes: 20L and 24L. It must be pointed out that there are some major differences between the two sizes. For instance, the 24L version also has a side zipper for the laptop sleeve, which personally is a must have for me. The 24L also comes with a removable waist belt.\n\nWhile the 20L has stretchy bottle pockets on BOTH sides, the 24L has a zippered pocket on one side and an open bottle pocket on the other side! The 24L is definitely the proper size for my EDC carry. Just the other day I was able to fit my MacBook Air, iPad Mini, camera gear, extra hoodie, two bottles, smaller accessories and Aer Slim Pouch (for tech accessories) with ease.\n\nOf course, with the flap, there is some expendability and I can use the flap to carry my hoodie or jacket too (as shown in one photo above). And yeah, it does look like the bag has an angry face. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it!\n\nBy the way, there is also a lengthy review of the 20L version on reddit! [Check it out](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/o66doe/deuter_walker_20l_minimalist_and_extra/)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Material / straps / back padding**\n\nThe Walker 24 is made of a really elastic and light, but tear-resistant 300D PES Ripstop material. I’m usually a Cordura kind of guy, but I’m digging this material a lot, and it doesn’t pick up as much hair and lint as other bags that I’ve used. The bottom, which is a different color in all Walker models, is made of a more robust 600D PES material.\n\nThe straps are pretty beefy and even rigid, they feel comfortable on my shoulders and offer good support, but they definitely need some breaking in and softening up for maximum comfort. The back panel, in my opinion, is this backpack’s most surprising and unique feature. It’s called Deuter’s Airstripes, which means that the back panel consists of two very thick and long pieces of padding that offer excellent ventilation and support.\n\nThis might be the only backpack I’ve worn where I don’t feel the entire back panel against my back while I wear it, only the “Airstripes”. It feels even weird and unusual at first, but now I’ve gotten used to it, and I have to say it’s amazing and really helps with back sweat. I believe that Deuter uses this back panel on their cycling bags and they’ve brilliantly brought this invention to this daypack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nWhile the main compartment (light grey interior, rather than black!) is just one big bucket with two sleeves (a bigger one for a 15 inch laptop and a smaller one for something like an iPad), there is some organization for smaller accessories.There’s a nice front pocket where you will find some sleeves for a wallet and pens and a nice detachable keyclip.\n\nThe 24L has an extra side pocket where I currently keep my portable cutlery set, packable shopping bag and wet wipes, but it can also take a smaller bottle. On the other side is a bottle pocket, which works reasonably well, but I wish it were a bit tighter and deeper - a slimmer and smoother bottle might slip out if you are not careful. It has lots of stretch to it and I was even able to fit my massive two-liter bottle in it when the bag was half-empty, but there is room for improvement for sure.\n\nHowever, I don’t understand why Deuter didn’t add a small pocket in the top flap, it would have been a really nice addition! I always like a top quick access pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall...**\n\nThe heritage style might not be for everyone, but I think this is a great summer bag for many reasons: there are many fun color options, it has some expandability if you want to go to the beach or some place and take a bunch of stuff, and the back panel is actually perfect for a nice warm summer hike. I am definitely more interested in Deuter now as a company and I already checked out their camera bag!\n\nAsk anything!",

            "body": "**The Walker 24** is a fun, casual and surprisingly thoughtful 24-liter daypack from an old German company called Deuter. Deuter specializes in hiking and cycling bags but they also make casual daypacks in different styles.\n\nUnlike most Deuter bags, the Walker 24 has a  heritage style with some really modern elements, like their incredible and quite unique Airstripes back panel (more on that later)\n\nThe Walker 24 comes in a variety of different colors. You can choose something more subtle like the marine-ink (dark blue) or go completely dark with the graphite-black (dark grey with black bottom). But you can also choose brighter colors like red or yellow, which is pretty much what mine is, although Deuter calls my colorway caramel-clay.\n\nMy favorite color for sure is actually the [khaki-lion](https://www.speck-sports.com/52374-thickbox_default/backpack-deuter-walker-24-khaki--lion.jpg) but sadly it’s either out of production or just out of stock for now. The caramel-clay looks ultimately like mustard to me - it’s not really a bright yellow, I would say it’s more earthy, darker yellow. The color actually looks really different depending on the light, in fact even if you look through the photos I took of my pack, the color looks kinda different depending on the picture. It’s a nice color for sure, summery and cheery but not too aggressively yellow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Size**\n\nThe Walker backpack is available in two different sizes: 20L and 24L. It must be pointed out that there are some major differences between the two sizes. For instance, the 24L version also has a side zipper for the laptop sleeve, which personally is a must have for me. The 24L also comes with a removable waist belt.\n\nWhile the 20L has stretchy bottle pockets on BOTH sides, the 24L has a zippered pocket on one side and an open bottle pocket on the other side! The 24L is definitely the proper size for my EDC carry. Just the other day I was able to fit my MacBook Air, iPad Mini, camera gear, extra hoodie, two bottles, smaller accessories and Aer Slim Pouch (for tech accessories) with ease.\n\nOf course, with the flap, there is some expendability and I can use the flap to carry my hoodie or jacket too (as shown in one photo above). And yeah, it does look like the bag has an angry face. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it!\n\nBy the way, there is also a lengthy review of the 20L version on reddit! [Check it out](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/o66doe/deuter_walker_20l_minimalist_and_extra/)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Material / straps / back padding**\n\nThe Walker 24 is made of a really elastic and light, but tear-resistant 300D PES Ripstop material. I’m usually a Cordura kind of guy, but I’m digging this material a lot, and it doesn’t pick up as much hair and lint as other bags that I’ve used. The bottom, which is a different color in all Walker models, is made of a more robust 600D PES material.\n\nThe straps are pretty beefy and even rigid, they feel comfortable on my shoulders and offer good support, but they definitely need some breaking in and softening up for maximum comfort. The back panel, in my opinion, is this backpack’s most surprising and unique feature. It’s called Deuter’s Airstripes, which means that the back panel consists of two very thick and long pieces of padding that offer excellent ventilation and support.\n\nThis might be the only backpack I’ve worn where I don’t feel the entire back panel against my back while I wear it, only the “Airstripes”. It feels even weird and unusual at first, but now I’ve gotten used to it, and I have to say it’s amazing and really helps with back sweat. I believe that Deuter uses this back panel on their cycling bags and they’ve brilliantly brought this invention to this daypack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nWhile the main compartment (light grey interior, rather than black!) is just one big bucket with two sleeves (a bigger one for a 15 inch laptop and a smaller one for something like an iPad), there is some organization for smaller accessories.There’s a nice front pocket where you will find some sleeves for a wallet and pens and a nice detachable keyclip.\n\nThe 24L has an extra side pocket where I currently keep my portable cutlery set, packable shopping bag and wet wipes, but it can also take a smaller bottle. On the other side is a bottle pocket, which works reasonably well, but I wish it were a bit tighter and deeper - a slimmer and smoother bottle might slip out if you are not careful. It has lots of stretch to it and I was even able to fit my massive two-liter bottle in it when the bag was half-empty, but there is room for improvement for sure.\n\nHowever, I don’t understand why Deuter didn’t add a small pocket in the top flap, it would have been a really nice addition! I always like a top quick access pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall...**\n\nThe heritage style might not be for everyone, but I think this is a great summer bag for many reasons: there are many fun color options, it has some expandability if you want to go to the beach or some place and take a bunch of stuff, and the back panel is actually perfect for a nice warm summer hike. I am definitely more interested in Deuter now as a company and I already checked out their camera bag!\n\nAsk anything!",

Just the other day I was able to fit my MacBook Air, iPad Mini, camera gear, extra hoodie, two bottles, smaller accessories and Aer Slim Pouch (for tech accessories) with ease.\n\nOf course, with the flap, there is some expendability and I can use the flap to carry my hoodie or jacket too (as shown in one photo above).

I’m usually a Cordura kind of guy, but I’m digging this material a lot, and it doesn’t pick up as much hair and lint as other bags that I’ve used. The bottom, which is a different color in all Walker models, is made of a more robust 600D PES material.\n\nThe straps are pretty beefy and even rigid, they feel comfortable on my shoulders and offer good support, but they definitely need some breaking in and softening up for maximum comfort. The back panel, in my opinion, is this backpack’s most surprising and unique feature. It’s called Deuter’s Airstripes, which means that the back panel consists of two very thick and long pieces of padding that offer excellent ventilation and support.\n\nThis might be the only backpack I’ve worn where I don’t feel the entire back panel against my back while I wear it, only the “Airstripes”. It feels even weird and unusual at first, but now I’ve gotten used to it, and I have to say it’s amazing and really helps with back sweat. I believe that Deuter uses this back panel on their cycling bags and they’ve brilliantly brought this invention to this daypack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nWhile the main compartment (light grey interior, rather than black!) is just one big bucket with two sleeves (a bigger one for a 15 inch laptop and a smaller one for something like an iPad), there is some organization for smaller accessories.There’s a nice front pocket where you will find some sleeves for a wallet and pens and a nice detachable keyclip.\n\nThe 24L has an extra side pocket where I currently keep my portable cutlery set, packable shopping bag and wet wipes, but it can also take a smaller bottle. On the other side is a bottle pocket, which works reasonably well, but I wish it were a bit tighter and deeper - a slimmer and smoother bottle might slip out if you are not careful. It has lots of stretch to it and I was even able to fit my massive two-liter bottle in it when the bag was half-empty, but there is room for improvement for sure.\n\nHowever, I don’t understand why Deuter didn’t add a small pocket in the top flap, it would have been a really nice addition! I always like a top quick access pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall...**\n\nThe heritage style might not be for everyone, but I think this is a great summer bag for many reasons: there are many fun color options, it has some expandability if you want to go to the beach or some place and take a bunch of stuff, and the back panel is actually perfect for a nice warm summer hike. I am definitely more interested in Deuter now as a company and I already checked out their camera bag!\n\nAsk anything!",

            "body": "**The Walker 24** is a fun, casual and surprisingly thoughtful 24-liter daypack from an old German company called Deuter. Deuter specializes in hiking and cycling bags but they also make casual daypacks in different styles.\n\nUnlike most Deuter bags, the Walker 24 has a  heritage style with some really modern elements, like their incredible and quite unique Airstripes back panel (more on that later)\n\nThe Walker 24 comes in a variety of different colors. You can choose something more subtle like the marine-ink (dark blue) or go completely dark with the graphite-black (dark grey with black bottom). But you can also choose brighter colors like red or yellow, which is pretty much what mine is, although Deuter calls my colorway caramel-clay.\n\nMy favorite color for sure is actually the [khaki-lion](https://www.speck-sports.com/52374-thickbox_default/backpack-deuter-walker-24-khaki--lion.jpg) but sadly it’s either out of production or just out of stock for now. The caramel-clay looks ultimately like mustard to me - it’s not really a bright yellow, I would say it’s more earthy, darker yellow. The color actually looks really different depending on the light, in fact even if you look through the photos I took of my pack, the color looks kinda different depending on the picture. It’s a nice color for sure, summery and cheery but not too aggressively yellow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Size**\n\nThe Walker backpack is available in two different sizes: 20L and 24L. It must be pointed out that there are some major differences between the two sizes. For instance, the 24L version also has a side zipper for the laptop sleeve, which personally is a must have for me. The 24L also comes with a removable waist belt.\n\nWhile the 20L has stretchy bottle pockets on BOTH sides, the 24L has a zippered pocket on one side and an open bottle pocket on the other side! The 24L is definitely the proper size for my EDC carry.

            "body": "**The Walker 24** is a fun, casual and surprisingly thoughtful 24-liter daypack from an old German company called Deuter. Deuter specializes in hiking and cycling bags but they also make casual daypacks in different styles.\n\nUnlike most Deuter bags, the Walker 24 has a  heritage style with some really modern elements, like their incredible and quite unique Airstripes back panel (more on that later)\n\nThe Walker 24 comes in a variety of different colors. You can choose something more subtle like the marine-ink (dark blue) or go completely dark with the graphite-black (dark grey with black bottom). But you can also choose brighter colors like red or yellow, which is pretty much what mine is, although Deuter calls my colorway caramel-clay.\n\nMy favorite color for sure is actually the [khaki-lion](https://www.speck-sports.com/52374-thickbox_default/backpack-deuter-walker-24-khaki--lion.jpg) but sadly it’s either out of production or just out of stock for now. The caramel-clay looks ultimately like mustard to me - it’s not really a bright yellow, I would say it’s more earthy, darker yellow. The color actually looks really different depending on the light, in fact even if you look through the photos I took of my pack, the color looks kinda different depending on the picture. It’s a nice color for sure, summery and cheery but not too aggressively yellow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Size**\n\nThe Walker backpack is available in two different sizes: 20L and 24L. It must be pointed out that there are some major differences between the two sizes. For instance, the 24L version also has a side zipper for the laptop sleeve, which personally is a must have for me. The 24L also comes with a removable waist belt.\n\nWhile the 20L has stretchy bottle pockets on BOTH sides, the 24L has a zippered pocket on one side and an open bottle pocket on the other side! The 24L is definitely the proper size for my EDC carry. Just the other day I was able to fit my MacBook Air, iPad Mini, camera gear, extra hoodie, two bottles, smaller accessories and Aer Slim Pouch (for tech accessories) with ease.\n\nOf course, with the flap, there is some expendability and I can use the flap to carry my hoodie or jacket too (as shown in one photo above). And yeah, it does look like the bag has an angry face. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it!\n\nBy the way, there is also a lengthy review of the 20L version on reddit! [Check it out](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/o66doe/deuter_walker_20l_minimalist_and_extra/)!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Material / straps / back padding**\n\nThe Walker 24 is made of a really elastic and light, but tear-resistant 300D PES Ripstop material. I’m usually a Cordura kind of guy, but I’m digging this material a lot, and it doesn’t pick up as much hair and lint as other bags that I’ve used. The bottom, which is a different color in all Walker models, is made of a more robust 600D PES material.\n\nThe straps are pretty beefy and even rigid, they feel comfortable on my shoulders and offer good support, but they definitely need some breaking in and softening up for maximum comfort. The back panel, in my opinion, is this backpack’s most surprising and unique feature. It’s called Deuter’s Airstripes, which means that the back panel consists of two very thick and long pieces of padding that offer excellent ventilation and support.\n\nThis might be the only backpack I’ve worn where I don’t feel the entire back panel against my back while I wear it, only the “Airstripes”. It feels even weird and unusual at first, but now I’ve gotten used to it, and I have to say it’s amazing and really helps with back sweat. I believe that Deuter uses this back panel on their cycling bags and they’ve brilliantly brought this invention to this daypack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Organization**\n\nWhile the main compartment (light grey interior, rather than black!) is just one big bucket with two sleeves (a bigger one for a 15 inch laptop and a smaller one for something like an iPad), there is some organization for smaller accessories.There’s a nice front pocket where you will find some sleeves for a wallet and pens and a nice detachable keyclip.\n\nThe 24L has an extra side pocket where I currently keep my portable cutlery set, packable shopping bag and wet wipes, but it can also take a smaller bottle. On the other side is a bottle pocket, which works reasonably well, but I wish it were a bit tighter and deeper - a slimmer and smoother bottle might slip out if you are not careful. It has lots of stretch to it and I was even able to fit my massive two-liter bottle in it when the bag was half-empty, but there is room for improvement for sure.\n\nHowever, I don’t understand why Deuter didn’t add a small pocket in the top flap, it would have been a really nice addition! I always like a top quick access pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overall...**\n\nThe heritage style might not be for everyone, but I think this is a great summer bag for many reasons: there are many fun color options, it has some expandability if you want to go to the beach or some place and take a bunch of stuff, and the back panel is actually perfect for a nice warm summer hike. I am definitely more interested in Deuter now as a company and I already checked out their camera bag!\n\nAsk anything!",

Of course, this isn’t a water-proof pack, just a water-proof fabric used as part of the pack material. I don’t know what they can do to repair that section that looks as if it is peeling or flaking; however, they will repair it if possible.\n-\tYou may be able to apply some gore repair tape or a patch to cover that area and provide both abrasion protection (from further damage) and prevent further peeling. You could try this in any areas (to match/balance) and prevent any damage to other areas.\n-\tTurn-around time is a factor. The sooner you get it in, the sooner you will have it back (obv). If you choose to go elsewhere, be mindful that they won’t necessarily do the same quality of repair. Many tailors can do a basic job, but they don’t specialize in outdoor gear and luggage/packs.",

I know this is asked frequently in this sub, but I’d appreciate some insight on the repair process for a pack like this - has anyone had similar experiences getting any of these issues repaired? Luckily I live near a local Patagonia store, but I’m concerned about the turnover time like many have mentioned and if she’s too far gone, I may tackle some of the projects myself. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated!",

                "body": "I just took in my 10+ year old 32l Chacabuco pack into my local flagship store to be sent out to Reno for repair. They advised turnaround was up to 9 weeks. \n\nI bit the bullet because it’s my work pack and need it back asap. I’m kicking myself for not sending it in at first signs of zipper problems last fall :/\n\nMy biggest issue is the main compartment zipper pulls both detached from one side of the zipper track a few weeks back. The pulls came off years ago and I had since fashioned my own Paracord pulls. Now the zipper finally gave way and split open completely. \n\nThey said they could fix it no problem, but still offered me credit to exchange for a new pack. I said thanks, but no way! I love my pack and it has so many memories from all the adventures! Plus the new style has slightly different pocket arrangements and doesn’t come with the microfiber lined sunglass pocket on top! \n\nThe lip of fabric that covers the main compartment zipper was also worn and they said that could be mended too. \nI pointed out that the external elastic cord to attach things on the front had given out, as well as the elastic in the top of the side pockets/water bottle holders. They said that would not be repaired as it’s not under warranty. Fine, but kind of surprising they won’t cover everything that doesn’t function anymore. I can weave thru a new bungee when it’s returned to me but kinda bummed about the side pockets essentially being unsecure for the rest of time. \n\nYears ago I took in my 28l Atacama pack that had body damage on the bottom of the main compartment and the bottom of the back straps. It was sent to Reno and they called to say it was unable to be repaired and offered me credit to buy anew. I asked for my pack to please be returned to me instead. At the time, the mender in my local store said he could fix it, but it wouldn’t look pretty. I didn’t mind! But after being without it for more than a month I opted to just keep using it and be careful until I could take it back in. Welp, time flies and that person no longer works at my local store. I tried bringing it in again last November to be looked over and they again said it was unable to be repaired. Again, I was offered credit and I politely declined. My plan for this pack is to take it to a local mom and pop tailor/shoe repairmen to see what they can do.\n\nI would like to say your strap would be repaired no problem but not sure what the response would be for the worn black hole fabric and the back fabric. It wouldn’t hurt to call your local store and describe the damage. I did this each time and they always said to bring it in to be evaluated thoroughly and they’d go from there! I’m personally quite crafty but sewing thick materials is hard, literally and physically haha. I won’t go thicker than board shorts seams anymore. But all the power to you if you have the drive, materials, and know how. \nHope this helps?! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤙🏼",

They advised turnaround was up to 9 weeks. \n\nI bit the bullet because it’s my work pack and need it back asap. I’m kicking myself for not sending it in at first signs of zipper problems last fall :/\n\nMy biggest issue is the main compartment zipper pulls both detached from one side of the zipper track a few weeks back. The pulls came off years ago and I had since fashioned my own Paracord pulls. Now the zipper finally gave way and split open completely. \n\nThey said they could fix it no problem, but still offered me credit to exchange for a new pack. I said thanks, but no way! I love my pack and it has so many memories from all the adventures! Plus the new style has slightly different pocket arrangements and doesn’t come with the microfiber lined sunglass pocket on top! \n\nThe lip of fabric that covers the main compartment zipper was also worn and they said that could be mended too. \nI pointed out that the external elastic cord to attach things on the front had given out, as well as the elastic in the top of the side pockets/water bottle holders. They said that would not be repaired as it’s not under warranty. Fine, but kind of surprising they won’t cover everything that doesn’t function anymore. I can weave thru a new bungee when it’s returned to me but kinda bummed about the side pockets essentially being unsecure for the rest of time. \n\nYears ago I took in my 28l Atacama pack that had body damage on the bottom of the main compartment and the bottom of the back straps. It was sent to Reno and they called to say it was unable to be repaired and offered me credit to buy anew. I asked for my pack to please be returned to me instead. At the time, the mender in my local store said he could fix it, but it wouldn’t look pretty. I didn’t mind! But after being without it for more than a month I opted to just keep using it and be careful until I could take it back in. Welp, time flies and that person no longer works at my local store. I tried bringing it in again last November to be looked over and they again said it was unable to be repaired. Again, I was offered credit and I politely declined. My plan for this pack is to take it to a local mom and pop tailor/shoe repairmen to see what they can do.\n\nI would like to say your strap would be repaired no problem but not sure what the response would be for the worn black hole fabric and the back fabric. It wouldn’t hurt to call your local store and describe the damage. I did this each time and they always said to bring it in to be evaluated thoroughly and they’d go from there! I’m personally quite crafty but sewing thick materials is hard, literally and physically haha. I won’t go thicker than board shorts seams anymore. But all the power to you if you have the drive, materials, and know how. \nHope this helps?! 🤷🏻‍♀️🤙🏼",

I'm not bothered about the vegan/sustainability aspects of it at all. \n\nAny recommendations or brands would be eagerly received as I'm a bit of a backpack novice to be honest.",

Yet it's not a perfect backpack.\n\n1. I found that I hit weight limit for carry-on on airplanes before filling this backpack. Like I almost always has an extra space in backpack. On the other hand - I rarely need extra bags in everyday life.\n2. It has no good places to attached light reflective tags (road safety). \n3. It's possible to attach small lock to zippers.\n4. Waist straps not that useful. I rarely pack it more than 8kg and usually have these straps hanging under the backpack.\n5. It's on a heavier side - 980g. If you flying with carry-on only, you often has something like 8kg weight limit. I.e. only 7 kg for useful payload.\n6. It's not that waterresistant. Well, in everyday use I was always OK. It has no dedicated pocket for rain cover. Showers sometimes make it inside. Rain cover is sold separately. Tried cheap Decathlon rain cover and not happy with it. It looks like water flows on my back between airstripes and accumulates at the bottom of the rain cover. Which means backpack is literally stays in pool of water. Once was in showers for like 1 hour or a bit more with this Decathlon rain cover and water successfully made it inside the backpack :( Hole at the bottom of rain cover may help dip the water. Bought original Deuter rain cover but haven't tried it yet. Skeptical about it, honestly speaking. It has hole for water, but it looks for me like it located too high. Probably will cut a hole in Decathlon one.\n\nI use it few years as my everyday, travel and even hiking (short hikes) backpack and overall very happy with it.",

Potpuno menja iskustvo planinarenja, vuna upija vlagu i znoj i sa nogu i izmedju prepona i sa ledja/pazuha, i cak i nakon 5h pesacenja ces biti suv ko da si se obrisao peskirom.\n\nMana je cena, carape nisu ispod 30 evra, boxerice oko 50 i majica oko 50, ali kad jednom odes na planinarenje u toj kombinaciji, nikad se neces vracati pamucnom vesu ili sintetickim carapama.\n\nZiv bio!",

        "selftext": "Hopefully this is the right place to ask.\n\nThe time is drawing near to finally replace the backpack I bought in the 6th grade. I am a college freshman and currently use a Bondka backpack that isn't even made anymore (the one in the photo). I carry A LOT of things (16\" laptop, 2-4 textbooks daily, notebook, pen bag, small snacks, laptop charger, phone charger, small first aid kit, makeup bag, small bag of other essentials, umbrella, wallet.) I'm very particular when it comes to bags. I love how big my current backpack is, I really like the small buckle compartment on the front and the dedicated laptop compartment on the backside of the bag, it allows me to get my laptop put without opening my whole backpack when I don't need to. While it's not an absolute must, I also like having a buckle that goes across the chest. Is there any backpack similar/ almost identical to the Bondka I currently have? I'm willing to spend about $180 at most but if a bag is close enough I'll spend more. Thanks! ",
