        "selftext": "‚Ä¶or should I just stop being so damn fussy and just choose a commuter bag already? \n\nThis is my third attempt at finding an office commuter pack. Here are my findings ***(scroll for TL;DR at the end):***\n\n* [Aer Go Pack 2](https://www.aersf.com/go-pack-2-black) \n\nNearly the perfect pack for me in every way - best top quick access pocket ever, favorite zipper pulls, excellent water bottle pockets, lightweight, easy clean, liner fabric is super tactilely pleasing, minimal ‚Äúorganization.‚Äù Generally an incredibly well made pack.\n\nRuled out because the exact position of the suspended laptop sleeve makes my work laptop jab into my back unless I cinch the straps all the way up‚Ä¶ which then makes carrying uncomfortable.\n\n* [Alpha One Niner Whitley](https://www.alphaoneniner.com/collections/featured/products/whitley?variant=42884509794533) \n\nMy favorite exterior fabric (+1000D cordura), love the high viz orange lining, smooth zippers, amazing top grab handle, stands on its own, comfy back panel and straps.\n\nRuled out (maybe!) because the admin panel is useless to me due to all the zippers, padded pockets, and other organization paraphernalia.

        "selftext": "‚Ä¶or should I just stop being so damn fussy and just choose a commuter bag already? \n\nThis is my third attempt at finding an office commuter pack. Here are my findings ***(scroll for TL;DR at the end):***\n\n* [Aer Go Pack 2](https://www.aersf.com/go-pack-2-black) \n\nNearly the perfect pack for me in every way - best top quick access pocket ever, favorite zipper pulls, excellent water bottle pockets, lightweight, easy clean, liner fabric is super tactilely pleasing, minimal ‚Äúorganization.‚Äù Generally an incredibly well made pack.\n\nRuled out because the exact position of the suspended laptop sleeve makes my work laptop jab into my back unless I cinch the straps all the way up‚Ä¶ which then makes carrying uncomfortable.\n\n* [Alpha One Niner Whitley](https://www.alphaoneniner.com/collections/featured/products/whitley?variant=42884509794533) \n\nMy favorite exterior fabric (+1000D cordura), love the high viz orange lining, smooth zippers, amazing top grab handle, stands on its own, comfy back panel and straps.\n\nRuled out (maybe!) because the admin panel is useless to me due to all the zippers, padded pockets, and other organization paraphernalia. The design of this stuff completely obstructs me even using that compartment in the bag with my pouch setup. The straps fit slightly off from perfectly comfortable at my desired tightness (unless I use the sternum strap). \n\nNote for well-hydrated folks: the water bottle pockets work okay for me as a raisin-like human, but beware the side pockets are tiny (with a bit of stretch).\n\nIt‚Äôs a great pack so even if I don‚Äôt use it for work, I‚Äôll probably use it for weekend travel (with sternum strap) - may even fuck around and try unstitching that admin panel to completely remove it if the Raven doesn‚Äôt work out.\n\n* [Fjallraven Raven 28L](https://www.fjallraven.com/us/en-us/bags-gear/backpacks-bags/laptop-bags/raven-282?v=F23345%3a%3a7323450786199)\n\nJust arrived today. The Raven 28 solves the main problems I had with both of the previous bags, but in exchange it offers 2.5 new issues (because I‚Äôm *particular* - I know it‚Äôs a ‚Äúme problem‚Äù but this is the sub where we droll on about bags so‚Ä¶ hi) \n\n0.5) it is a magnet for detritus of all sorts (I did know this before purchasing and it‚Äôs only half an issue since I‚Äôm meticulous about cleaning my bags anyway - yes, I‚Äôm aware this is odd, leave me alone with my clean bags)\n\n1) it does not stand up on its own. I also knew this going into the purchase, but I didn‚Äôt know I *cared* about that as a feature. Apparently, I do. Seems dumb to care about that, so I‚Äôm going to try‚Ä¶ not caring.\n\n2) Titanic‚Äôs iceberg‚Ä¶ It has the most ridiculous flaps covering each zipper coil on every compartment. Why? *[rhetorical]* Again, I knew this going into the purchase, but I didn‚Äôt know I cared. I care a **lot.** It ruins the smoothness of the zippers (and there are so many zippers to be ruined!) \n\n***TL;DR do the zipper cover flaps ‚Äúbreak in‚Äù or has anyone tried cutting them off without ruining the bag aesthetics?***",

You‚Äôre searching for the perfect bag for you which is the mission we all are on because we are all chasing the 100% perfect bag hence manybaggers. \n\nMy advice would be if these are your highest potential bags. Pick the bag that has the least compromises. Also consider yourself and how you use your bag EVERYDAY. Some issues will be an everyday issue while others might be a once in awhile issue and consider that. Don‚Äôt be afraid of trying too many bags out, my vibe is if you don‚Äôt love it then you shouldn‚Äôt own it. If you have to say yea I like it a lot BUT‚Ä¶. then you don‚Äôt love it. I hope you enjoy whichever one you pick!",

This will be used primarily for EDC, mobile office, personal item when travelling (alongside a main larger bag), and as a dad bag. I‚Äôm starting a new side job and will be doing some process improvement consulting in a variety of fields (healthcare, oil and gas, manufacturing, government), so I‚Äôd like something that looks fairly professional but not too stuffy. The usual items I carry are as follows:\n\n* 14\" laptop\n* A few pens\n* 1-2 notebooks\n* Pencil kit\n* Small first aid kit\n* File folder\n* Earbud headphones\n* Leatherman multitool\n* A few meds and small toiletry items\n* 20 oz coffee mug and/or water bottle\n* Sometimes a rain jacket\n* Sometimes diapers, wipes, change pad, etc.\n* Sometimes my son‚Äôs toys and extra clothes\n\nI was initially looking at the GR1, but quickly decided that I‚Äôll be getting a Rucker for workouts instead. The two that have caught my eye, due to features and the price, are the Alpha One Niner Evade 1.5 (full) and Whitley. Would either of these be a good option? A couple people also suggested looking at a messenger bag such as the Chrome Buran iii. I am located in Canada, so shipping and duties can be an issue on more expensive bags.\n\nThanks!",

            "body": "* The first notable thing is it's pretty heavy. It feels in the hands exactly like how a 3.25lbs backpack would feel like\n* The second notable thing is it's VERY comfortable. I actually didn't think backpacks could be this comfortable. I packed this thing out with a heavy picture book, a big sketchbook, a mirrorless camera, a bunch of battery packs, filled out admin panels. Walked around and wow, I didn't feel the weight at all - it felt almost weightless. I was surprised because the backpack itself is objectively heavy when you lift it up by hand. The weight was so well distributed to all points of the harness. I felt some of the weight in the back padding too. It felt like the weight was a part of my body whole rather than just concentrated on the traps or neck.\n* Fabric looks nice, is a bit rough and attracts dust kinda easily. I like the diamond pattern.\n* The interior orange isn't like what you would see in the reviews, it's a tiny bit transparent and shows some black behind it\n* Water bottle holder vs thin Hydro Flask - meh? It does the job fine but it doesn't feel secure, like the bottle could randomly come out. I wouldn't trust it - but I think a good solution is to tether it to one of the lash points.\n* Panel pockets are pretty stiff, I couldn't fully fit my Fuji x100F in any of them. I could put the Fuji in the very front pocket but it makes it jut out considerably. Basically, not many nice places to put a camera.\n* Capacity seems good. This is the type of backpack to carry a laptop, some notebooks, some books. Accomodates flat rectangular items very well.\n* Front panel being stiff makes the main compartment a bit more difficult to reach. Not a big issue but it does impede in certain ways.\n* Makes a good desk [companion](https://i.imgur.com/nzrtdhT.jpg) \\- like a free standing tech pouch. Admin panel is very useful.\n\nCompared to Osprey Arcane - my previous pack:\n\n* Much much much more comfortable than the Osprey. I didn't like the Osprey harness at all - no sternum strap, and all the weight is concentrated on my traps. And I dont get why Osprey puts that annoying C-shaped fabric behind the neck. It was pinching my neck and traps really badly. Like why?\n* I like the Osprey main compartment better, it's easy to open and work with, because the front \"panel\" on the Osprey isn't so stiff. \n* I like the Osprey water bottle compartment even if it's restrictive - it feels like it keeps the water bottle tucked in securely.\n* Styling goes to the Osprey here. A19 Whitley has a bit more gritty military aesthetic, while Arcane has a unassuming urban aesthetic I really like. Osprey is also a nice brand and logo to show off\n* Value - if the Osprey was more comfortable for me I would 100% recommend it over the A19 Whitley as I feel like they achieve the same goals. It's just the Whitley is so much more comfortable for me. Might be a different experience for someone else tho",

            "body": "* The first notable thing is it's pretty heavy. It feels in the hands exactly like how a 3.25lbs backpack would feel like\n* The second notable thing is it's VERY comfortable. I actually didn't think backpacks could be this comfortable. I packed this thing out with a heavy picture book, a big sketchbook, a mirrorless camera, a bunch of battery packs, filled out admin panels. Walked around and wow, I didn't feel the weight at all - it felt almost weightless. I was surprised because the backpack itself is objectively heavy when you lift it up by hand. The weight was so well distributed to all points of the harness. I felt some of the weight in the back padding too. It felt like the weight was a part of my body whole rather than just concentrated on the traps or neck.\n* Fabric looks nice, is a bit rough and attracts dust kinda easily. I like the diamond pattern.\n* The interior orange isn't like what you would see in the reviews, it's a tiny bit transparent and shows some black behind it\n* Water bottle holder vs thin Hydro Flask - meh? It does the job fine but it doesn't feel secure, like the bottle could randomly come out. I wouldn't trust it - but I think a good solution is to tether it to one of the lash points.\n* Panel pockets are pretty stiff, I couldn't fully fit my Fuji x100F in any of them. I could put the Fuji in the very front pocket but it makes it jut out considerably. Basically, not many nice places to put a camera.\n* Capacity seems good. This is the type of backpack to carry a laptop, some notebooks, some books. Accomodates flat rectangular items very well.\n* Front panel being stiff makes the main compartment a bit more difficult to reach. Not a big issue but it does impede in certain ways.\n* Makes a good desk [companion](https://i.imgur.com/nzrtdhT.jpg) \\- like a free standing tech pouch. Admin panel is very useful.\n\nCompared to Osprey Arcane - my previous pack:\n\n* Much much much more comfortable than the Osprey. I didn't like the Osprey harness at all - no sternum strap, and all the weight is concentrated on my traps. And I dont get why Osprey puts that annoying C-shaped fabric behind the neck. It was pinching my neck and traps really badly. Like why?\n* I like the Osprey main compartment better, it's easy to open and work with, because the front \"panel\" on the Osprey isn't so stiff. \n* I like the Osprey water bottle compartment even if it's restrictive - it feels like it keeps the water bottle tucked in securely.\n* Styling goes to the Osprey here. A19 Whitley has a bit more gritty military aesthetic, while Arcane has a unassuming urban aesthetic I really like. Osprey is also a nice brand and logo to show off\n* Value - if the Osprey was more comfortable for me I would 100% recommend it over the A19 Whitley as I feel like they achieve the same goals. It's just the Whitley is so much more comfortable for me. Might be a different experience for someone else tho",

This bag seems to hold more than my CPL24 while simultaneous keeping everything easier to access, and having water bottle pockets, and looking smaller on my body. Fits my 26oz insulated bottle perfectly.  \n\nThe main compartment is still not quite as roomy as my CHZ22 however (to be expected with 2L less capacity), but the added organization is nice. Looking forward to trying this out tomorrow.\n\nHere's the full list of backpacks I've tested now over the last 2 months if anyone would like to know more.  \n  \n\nBellroy Classic Backpack  \nTimbuk2 Division Deluxe  \nSwissgear 1900  \nOsprey Daylite Plus  \nOsprey Arcane Large   \nAlpaka Elements Backpack LE VX42  \nMountain Hardwear Camp 4 21  \nMountain Hardwear Camp 4 28  \nPatagonia Black Hole 25L   \nPatagonia MLC 26 (2022)  \nEvergoods CHZ22 v2  \nEvergoods CTB26 [This one I never actually carried, it was defective]  \nEvergoods CPL 24 v3  \nAlpha One Niner Whitley VX42\n\nI‚Äôm not yet sure if this bag will be able to overtake the CHZ22 v2 as my EDC champ, but it‚Äôs certainly the closest anything has come thus far.\n\nEdit: \n\nFirst day with the A19 Whitley was excellent!! Other than the CHZ22, nothing else I‚Äôve tried so far has come close to as pleasant to use for EDC. I like it a lot, and it‚Äôs extremely comfortable even with loaded up with 4 laptops. \n\nThere‚Äôs just really something special I feel when using the CHZ22 though. It‚Äôs beautiful in its simplicity. It‚Äôs almost like a perfect object.\n\nKind of feeling organization overload on the Whitley, but this is something I could adjust to. \n\nIt uses its space very efficiently! With the admin panel in this bag, my main compartment is almost completely empty with what I daily carry. \n\n**Being able to fit AirPods Max in the front pocket is a game changer for me. First bag I‚Äôve found where they fit anywhere but the main compartment.** I actually added an umbrella to my carry simply because I have so much breathing room.",

On this bag, the layout allows me to stay organized with lighter items up top, and some larger organizer pockets at the bottom and middle of the bag which keeps the weight well distributed.

It helped me greatly in being able to visualize what can get packed into these bags.\n\nI restarted considering my need for the CPL24 since the mirrored version came out, and I swing my bags to the right shoulder typically.. I almost kind of love the way it tapers at the end. But never thought about how uncomfortable for some that may be. \n\nI think one of the few things that bug me about the CPL is really the lack of the water bottle pocket. But I love the way the rest of the bag looks, fits on a smaller frame (I'm 5'4 so larger boxier bags tend to be too turle-shell-y for me).\n\nAs for the a19, I basically love everything about it but it does look a bit almost, \\*too\\* boxy because there is no tapering at the bottom? It almost looks like it would be turtle-shell-y looking on me. My other gripe would be that to access the quick access front pocket, you'd need to take off your bag which I imagine could be annoying if you're on your way to a flight.\n\nI think if CPL had a water bottle pocket, it would be absolutely perfect. But the A19 tugs at me as well. Just the \"boxier\" look of it is kind of a turn off.",
