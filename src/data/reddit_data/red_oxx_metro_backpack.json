        "selftext": "Hey all, I am currently in the process of preparing for my first attempt at one bag indefinite traveling. I’m leaving where I am in less than two weeks and kind of overwhelmed with the concept. I am sure that I will refine my kit as I gain more experience living out of a backpack. I’m genuinely excited for this new chapter of my life and welcoming the known and unknown ahead.\n\nI am wanting to utilize this remaining time to critique my gear, do more research, and feel confident in stepping off with only one bag to get me where I need to go and adequately sustain me as I’m essentially “homeless” on the road. \n\nI’ll be working and living at national parks, resorts, lodges, etc. for several months at a time. I may not have big box stores to draw resources from or an address to have packages delivered to me. I am wanting to cover as many bases as possible from the start and only resupply the expected consumables when needed. \n\nI understand that I can’t pack (completely) for 4 seasons, extra boots, etc. while living out of a 35L pack. Should I be concerned with footwear? I plan on only wearing Merrel Moab 3 ventilated low cut shoes, I live in darn tough socks, and hoping that I can get weather appropriate footwear at my destinations as needed. Is this unrealistic? \n\nWhen I’m not working, I want to be traveling by plane, train, bus, all over the US and hopefully abroad and not packing the kitchen sink and dragging around two backpacks. \n\nI am curious if anyone else is also using the 35L GR3 for longer trips, what you’re comfortable bringing and would be interested in hearing experiences, lessons learned, or any feedback at all to help me pack appropriately to live out of a 35L rucksack. I have an LBT-8006a packed flat inside as a day pack but I am only wanting to carry the GR3 and then use the LBT as a day pack for day hikes, walking around town, etc. \n\nSorry if this wasn’t concise, was too vague, etc. this is my first time posting. I don’t have a packing list, yet, but I did pack out fully and feel like I’m not getting all the essentials in there. \nThanks! ",
