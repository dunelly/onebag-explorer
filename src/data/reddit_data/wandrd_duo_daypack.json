For a smaller dedicated sling you may be better off with a sling with a better integrated strap setup.  But for something that can convert, the Alpaka's are like the ones to beat at their price.

I've owned the Alpaka Tech case mini and it was too slim, so that's why I got the nano, and the tech case regular is like the minimum that can hold my ipad mini with Zugu case, its good for big laptop power bricks and mice too.  I've also owned the Alpaka metro sling (nice for small cameras but I prefer the horizontal orientation of the nano) and also have the modular phone sling (I plan on just using that as holster on future bags shoulder straps, since it has that function).  I also have a zip pouch max, that is on deep sale, its nice enough as just a throw all, maybe under jacket carry.\n\nI think you will like your Tech Case Max.  Overall I think the Alpaka makes nice small bags but the weakness is the removable straps, they are usually a little narrow (1\") though you can buy wider \"pro\" ones, but I don't love the buckle placement on those.  For a smaller dedicated sling you may be better off with a sling with a better integrated strap setup.  But for something that can convert, the Alpaka's are like the ones to beat at their price.  I find with slings, the thing I appreciate the most is how it wears (the strap) and not so much the bag itself.  I can work around the bags organization but not really the strap.  Alpaka is great at the bag itself, but the straps are sorta average, since the angle of mounting is sorta set.",

I've had a complicated relationship with WANDRD products. I have previously owned the PRVKE (which I ended up selling because it just felt a little chaotic and because I found that the side access was too small for my full-frame camera setup) and still have the DUO Daypack. I like the whole tarpaulin exterior and some of the features that WANDRD integrates, but I found that with the PRVKE there were too many places where the materials felt thin and insubstantial in a way that made me concerned about longevity and durability. I like WANDRD's designs, though, and really appreciated the look of Stratus and Nimbus. Since I don't \\_\\_love\\_\\_ my Peak Design 20L Everyday Zip, I figured I would take a shot at the Kickstarter price on the Stratus.\n\n**First Impressions**:\n\n* The bag is VERY solid. Definitely closer to the rigidity of the PRVKE with camera cubes installed than the DUO, which has a tendency to kind of collapse into itself in some ways\n* I LOVE the color. It's a very subdued grey-green that I think is unique without being too loud\n* The lining of the quick-access pocket is still pretty thin, but feels \"silkier\" than the thin, cheap-feeling nylon in some parts of the PRVKE.\n* Also - the quick-access pocket is ***quite*** small. Probably just enough for keys and a wallet or AirPods case. I don't know that I would trust sunglasses inside of it.\n* The frame sheet is VERY stiff. I honestly didn't realize (perhaps I missed it in the KS campaign materials) that the STRATUS would come with a rigid frame sheet. I suppose for a photo backpack that may be helpful.\n* The bag definitely seems to suffer from the same phenomenon that I \\*hate\\* about my PD EDB Zip 20: the laptop pocket is EXTREMELY tight. Even with the bag totally empty, with the dividers in the configuration they come in out of the box, I can barely slip my hand into the laptop sleeve. Just testing with my iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard, and I have to really shove to get it inside the laptop compartment. This is...**extremely** disappointing. With the dividers in place, I'm not sure if or how I'll be able to fit my MacBook inside (14\" MBP) Perhaps by rearranging the dividers I can make this less tight, but out of the gate I am concerned...",

Definitely much more elegantly integrated into the bag than they are on the PRVKE, and I like that there are two of them, also unlike the PRVKE.\n* The dual side access is nice, and I honestly kind of prefer it to the design of the Peak Design (and WANDRD Duo!) where the side access is reached through the same zipper track as the main compartment. The opening is also significantly larger than it is on the PRVKE, which is a great benefit.\n* The mesh pockets inside of the main compartment (above the dividers) are pretty typical of WANDRD, and are OK. The pocket on the inside of the front panel of the bag almost requires that the main zippered panel be fully inverted to practically reach the contents, which I expect is a reasonable trade-off for having the zipper oriented in such a fashion that your stuff doesn't spill out all over the ground if it's not zipped properly. The zip pocket against the back panel, however, is kind of poorly placed. I think I can understand (one of) the reason(s) that the QAP is so shallow: even at its size it obstructs view of the zipper to access the back panel mesh pocket, and so you are sort of left feeling around to get into it.\n* The main volume of the bag with the dividers installed at full depth is QUITE small. I know, I know: the bag is 18L after all...but it's still worth saying. If you leave all of the dividers in this bag, just know that the remaining space is VERY tight.\n* The grab handles on the side of the bag are very minimally padded, but I think it works. It's enough to help orient the bag or grab it in a pinch, and otherwise the handles stay out of the way. I think this is one of the best features of the bag.\n* The zippers are, like most of my experience with WANDRD products, a little tight and \"sticky.\" I suppose perhaps this is a product of the weather resistance, but they just don't slide terribly smoothly, and they are extremely noisy. They definitely don't give the most premium-feeling experience. But this is mostly a nitpick.\n* The dividers are I think much better thought-out than those in the PRVKE. They're definitely more similar to the ROGUE slings' dividers than anything, making a good compromise of flexibility and customizability with tidiness and structure.\n\nOverall I'm...whelmed with the bag. I like the side access and the divider system much more than the PRVKE, but the laptop compartment was and is my biggest complain with the PD bag, so I'm thoroughly disappointed that the STRATUS doesn't improve upon that and in fact might even be worse (I have no idea how a 16\" MBP would fit in that laptop compartment...I'm not even sure my 14\" will fit comfortably). The looks of the bag are good, and while capacity leaves something to be desired, I give points for the ability to add WANDRD's pouches as modular external accessories which expand capacity somewhat.\n\nI'm not disappointed enough to send the bag back or immediately try to do a Catch + Release, but overall I'm feeling a bit let down at first blush. Time will tell whether I come around on it in the coming days/weeks as I try to use it and give it a chance to grow on me.",

I've had a complicated relationship with WANDRD products. I have previously owned the PRVKE (which I ended up selling because it just felt a little chaotic and because I found that the side access was too small for my full-frame camera setup) and still have the DUO Daypack. I like the whole tarpaulin exterior and some of the features that WANDRD integrates, but I found that with the PRVKE there were too many places where the materials felt thin and insubstantial in a way that made me concerned about longevity and durability. I like WANDRD's designs, though, and really appreciated the look of Stratus and Nimbus. Since I don't \\_\\_love\\_\\_ my Peak Design 20L Everyday Zip, I figured I would take a shot at the Kickstarter price on the Stratus.\n\n**First Impressions**:\n\n* The bag is VERY solid. Definitely closer to the rigidity of the PRVKE with camera cubes installed than the DUO, which has a tendency to kind of collapse into itself in some ways\n* I LOVE the color. It's a very subdued grey-green that I think is unique without being too loud\n* The lining of the quick-access pocket is still pretty thin, but feels \"silkier\" than the thin, cheap-feeling nylon in some parts of the PRVKE.\n* Also - the quick-access pocket is ***quite*** small. Probably just enough for keys and a wallet or AirPods case. I don't know that I would trust sunglasses inside of it.\n* The frame sheet is VERY stiff. I honestly didn't realize (perhaps I missed it in the KS campaign materials) that the STRATUS would come with a rigid frame sheet. I suppose for a photo backpack that may be helpful.\n* The bag definitely seems to suffer from the same phenomenon that I \\*hate\\* about my PD EDB Zip 20: the laptop pocket is EXTREMELY tight. Even with the bag totally empty, with the dividers in the configuration they come in out of the box, I can barely slip my hand into the laptop sleeve. Just testing with my iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard, and I have to really shove to get it inside the laptop compartment. This is...**extremely** disappointing. With the dividers in place, I'm not sure if or how I'll be able to fit my MacBook inside (14\" MBP) Perhaps by rearranging the dividers I can make this less tight, but out of the gate I am concerned...",

Definitely much more elegantly integrated into the bag than they are on the PRVKE, and I like that there are two of them, also unlike the PRVKE.\n* The dual side access is nice, and I honestly kind of prefer it to the design of the Peak Design (and WANDRD Duo!) where the side access is reached through the same zipper track as the main compartment. The opening is also significantly larger than it is on the PRVKE, which is a great benefit.\n* The mesh pockets inside of the main compartment (above the dividers) are pretty typical of WANDRD, and are OK. The pocket on the inside of the front panel of the bag almost requires that the main zippered panel be fully inverted to practically reach the contents, which I expect is a reasonable trade-off for having the zipper oriented in such a fashion that your stuff doesn't spill out all over the ground if it's not zipped properly. The zip pocket against the back panel, however, is kind of poorly placed. I think I can understand (one of) the reason(s) that the QAP is so shallow: even at its size it obstructs view of the zipper to access the back panel mesh pocket, and so you are sort of left feeling around to get into it.\n* The main volume of the bag with the dividers installed at full depth is QUITE small.

The black is killing me.\n-\tThe zippers are a little tricky to get around the “corners” but I imagine I’ll adjust.\n-\tThe quick access and front vertical pockets have zipper garages with zipper pulls that are too small.

Like, when I travel, and want my laptop, kindle, one or two cameras, some lenses, all the dongles and chargers, and a little extra room for a light jacket, sunglasses, snacks, water bottle. The part against the back is not very comfortable. That’s probably my biggest piece of feedback. The padded interior pockets are awesome, and I wish they were actually a little bigger because they work great when I want to stash a small camera with a small lens. Would be so cool if I could squeeze just a little more in there. The pop up cube is  ok as-is, but would be better if there was an inside divider that also “popped up.” Instead there is a Velcro divider that you need to rip out and store when you want to pop the cube down. It is a little weird to get it back in when you want to use the cube again. Also, things at the bottom of the cube are very close to the bottom of the bag and the solid things in the outside world. The sides near the bottom are also thin. There are little doors that you can fold down, but I often tuck them away for easy access. The bag opens so far that it’s great when traveling and you want to pack and re-pack different ways. I wish the inside was a light color as I’ve lost things in the black hole and found them again on my next trip! Overall, a really nice product. For true “everyday” days (like when I don’t need my laptop or all the “things”I find myself needing “less” of a bag. Right now my eye is on the sling bags. Like the holy grail, the search continues forever…",

            "body": "I received my Wandrd Stratus 18L yesterday. I was concerned after seeing multiple comments about how tight the laptop section was, especially with the camera dividers installed, and they were right; it's not unusable, but definitely more tight than I was comfortable with.\n\nWhile exploring the laptop section I noticed a zipper that hadn't been mentioned. The actual hardware seemed reversed -- the slider's underside was facing out, and there wasn't any pull. That said, it wasn't hard to move the slider with my fingernail, and I discovered the plastic \"panel\" that was reinforced with an aluminum rod that had a slight s-curve to it.\n\nThe aluminum rod slid out easily, but the plastic panel wasn't budging. I gave up for a while and started pulling out the camera dividers to see if I could set up my preferred configuration for side-access bags like this. Once the dividers were out and the bag was \"floppy\" I took another look at the plastic panel and realized with the dividers out I could now manually roll in the outer edges of the panel, and it slid right out!\n\nWithout the panel and rod the laptop space is measurably more forgiving and my laptop (ASUS Zephyrus G14) now slides in and out incredibly easily. The back of the backpack (part that rests against my back) is still really comfortable, and everything else about the backpack still works as advertised. I was able to configure the dividers exactly how I wanted, and now I'm extremely excited about dailying this.\n\n(The zippers, though initially \"snaggy,\" have started to smooth out -- not sure if this is because I've subtly adjusted how I pull on them, but they're not longer a concern for me.)\n\nNot sure how many Stratus users there are right now, but I wanted to share this little tidbit. I'm assuming the designers intended the plastic panel to stay in, but it didn't work for me. YMMV as far as what the long-term implications of removing it are, but I'm glad I could remove it.",

But after removing the back panel as an experiment, It quickly resolved some of those issues. I can now fit my MacBook and an iPad (without dividers, haven’t tried with dividers), the hidden pocket on the back has more room, and it’s less heavy. I appreciate that WANDRD thought about increased comfort by including a back panel, but at 18L it might not even be necessary. So super happy it can be removed. I’ve been using this bag as my college backpack and I’m enjoying it so far. It’s my first real bag and I’m loving the built quality, comfort, and aesthetic",

Not sure how much it contributed to the weight -- the tarpaulin might be more of a factor based on the weight of my Prvke 21L -- but between removing it and 4 of the dividers (my preferred setup in all side-access bags only needs 2), the carry and use experience really has been fantastic. \n\nI watched Desi's video, too. My zippers, though mildly \"snaggy\" aren't nearly as bad as his seem to be -- they have, in fact, gotten better even after a single day of use. \n\nYour trip sounds fun! How do you plan to pack the bag out for it?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/12hggff/my_digital_nomad_packing_list_carryon_filmmaking/",
        "selftext": "Hello! I'm Sergio Sala, YouTuber making city guides for digital nomads for 3 years now —even tho I started as a web designer almost 10 years ago. While being on the road, I've tested all kind of travel gear that can adapt to my long term travel lifestyle; from clothes, digital tech and now filmmaking gear.\n\nI've been asked a lot to show what have I chosen to use so I just posted a [full video of everything I have](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avKRMrdl-1Q), but I think it will be useful if I share here the whole list, and the reason behind every item. Let's start with some notes:\n\n* I never check in luggage, even with filmmaking gear. I used to carry one bag but the camera gear takes space so I added a second one so it's like one-and-a-half bag.\n* I don't use Merino, it's itchy for me. So only synthetic minus a pair of merino wool socks.\n* Most of my clothes is Western Rise, seems like promotion but I really love their clothes lol.\n* My tech is mostly Apple, and I only goes USB-C (except for lightning).\n* TSA-approved for toiletries, I have never had to show them to security.\n* I wear only barefoot shoes, bringing 3 pairs with me.\n\nOk now, let me share you my full digital nomad packing list.\n\n[here's the layout of everything, plus a happy me behind](https://preview.redd.it/9jlgv0jup0ta1.jpg?width=2500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdae7e6999debd4560582877c767dcafa498a4ec)\n\n# Bags &amp; Organizers\n\n* **PAKT Travel Backpack**\n   * Great carry-on, loved the space organization by half. I use one size for bottoms and shoes, other for tops, jacket and has a compartment for toiletries. I do have another [full video about this bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9AHejP4xTk) if curious.\n* **PAKT Packing Cube Set**\n   * As a add-on, PAKT has its own packing cube sets that firs perfectly on the backpack.\n* **PAKT Packable Tote Bag**\n   * Another add-on, it's a packable tote bag that I usually take with me when I do groceries or need to carry some extra stuff.\n* **PAKT Rainfly**\n   * A cover for deep rain, even tho the backpack handles light water drops.\n* **WANDRD PRVKE Lite**\n   * This is my filmmaking backpack, the 11L has plenty of space to put everything from cameras to tripod. And even a small roll top to add more items.\n* **Chums Surfshort Wallet**\n   * A minimal wallet that has two compartments: one for id, credit cards and the other one for cash —still needed for some countries.\n* **Zero Grid Passport Wallet**\n   * I put the rest of my credit cards here, plus passport and some small documents. It includes a small pen that can come in handy when writing this visa papers.\n\n# Clothes &amp; Accessories\n\n* **Western Rise Session Tee 4x**\n   * I tested so many shirts (from Merino, Uniqlo and synthetics) and ending up like this lightweight, odor resistant and good looking shirts from Western Rise. I have 3 in black and one in ash. Love 'em.\n* **Western Rise Session Sun Hoody**\n   * There's also a hoody long sleeve version that I love to use too. Especially for hiking, long walk, transit and just to look nice.\n* **Bluffworks Threshold Crew Neck T-Shirt**\n   * The second t-shirt that I like, as they are very soft and lightweight. I could possibly get more if I want to have more colors. I kinda of use this one as my pajama shirt.\n* **Western Rise Airlight Shirt**\n   * Another great shirt for WE, I love the look and the lightweight material. They are currently working on improving the material of this shirt, but I will to buy more of these!\n* **Western Rise Evolution Pants 2.0**\n   * I love how lightweight and good looking are these pants. I won't bear anything else to be honest. I haven't used jeans in ages. I got 2 pairs, tho I might get the Diversion pants from the same brand for colder weather.\n* **Western Rise Boundless Short**\n   * When it gets hot, well WE also has great shorts. The Boundless look good and also can be used to go swimming.\n* **Western Rise Movement Shorts**\n   * But I also have a very lightweight and quick dry shorts from the same company, especially for surfing or any sport activity.\n* **Buff Neckwear**\n   * For the cold weather, I have a simple black neckwear from Buff. Always reliable.\n* **Western Rise Adapt Zip Quarter**\n   * I also bring a lightweight sweatshirt from WE, that looks good and comes in handy when malls in Asia are blasting the AC.\n* **Western Rise AirLoft Hooded Jacket**\n   * But when it gets really cold, I either this jacket alone or pair with above items, and it can cover lots of low weather days. I love this jacket, it can pack like a pillow when unused. Can resist water drops, and regulates your body heat.\n* **ExOfficioGive-N-Go Boxer Brief (4x)**\n   * I used the boxers for some many years that I really haven't found anything else better. Lightweight, durable, odor resistant and they have tons of color options.\n* **Cariloha Bamboo Athletic Socks (3x)**\n   * I found this socks in a mall while traveling in Cozumel, Mexico but turns out it was a big company that sell tons of bamboo items. Their socks are amazing, one of the best merino alternative options.\n* **Western Rise Strongcore Merino Socks**\n   * I bought this one to try as I love the Western Rise company, and I was surprised that I didn't felt itchy so I kept them. Only pair of merino apparel I have. They are good either way!\n* **Vivobarefoot Primus Trail II FG Mens Shoes**\n   * My everyday shoes. Really great for moving around, hiking, anything, sometimes even going out. They lasted about a year now, but they are tearing apart. Will buy another one soon. Made of vegan material btw.\n* **Wildling Flying Fox Shoes**\n   * Mostly for going out, really good looking barefoot shoes! This Wildling company has interesting shoes, you should check 'em out.\n* **Shamma Warrior Sandals**\n   * My fav sandals. I can't live without em. I lost 'em once, bought again instantly. It's lightweight,  good looking simple sandals. You can hike and run with them. So small I take them everywhere.\n* **Arcade Adventure Belt**\n   * I barely use a belt when I need, this comes in handy. The buckle is made of plastic so I wouldn't have problems going through security.\n* **Western Rise Versa Hat**\n   * Lightweight and crushable hat that comes in handy for hiking. Love this hat too, really.\n* **ROAV Foldable Sunglasses**\n   * My favorite sunglasses and I tried a bunch. Foldable and practical. Tons of options on their website, I could even buy more! But no.. let's keep it minimal.\n* **Matador Ultralight Travel Towel Large**\n   * I usually stay in airbnb or hotel that includes towels but it's good to have a packable towel when going swimming, surfing or stuff. This Matador quick dry towel is perfect for that.\n\n# Toiletry\n\n* **Peak Design Wash Pouch**\n   * Everything that I will mention below goes into this pouch. Might not the best one (as I'm curious to try more) but it does the job well with the organization.\n* **Chicago Comb Carbon Fiber Comb No. 2**\n   * A simple carbon fiber comb that's actually very practical, it has a big hole on the bottom so you can grab it well.\n* **Crystal Mineral Deodorant**\n   * My go-to deodorant, a small deodorant that fights the bacteria naturally.\n* **Gravel Travel Liquid Bottles**\n   * I got the pair that can be stackable. Use one for conditioner and one for toothpaste.\n* **Matador FlatPak Toiletry Bottle**\n   * I got one for shampoo, just as emergency, as most of airbnb has shampoo bottles.\n* **Matador FlatPak Soap Bar Case**\n   * I carry a soap also for emergencies and this thing works very well to keep the water moisture.\n* **Matador Waterproof Travel Canister**\n   * Lightweight place to store any pill, comes in very handy!\n* **Occo Bobbo Solid Cologne**\n   * A portable cologne that can last long as it's solid. Don't have to worry on liquid bottles anymore!\n* **Parker Safety Travel Razor**\n   * Small, very durable razor. Use Gillete heads so you can always get more on the road.\n* **Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant Tweezer**\n   * A simple tweezer for those hairy nose problems lol.\n* **Victorinox Swiss Army Nail Clippers**\n   * Small durable clippers. Takes a bit to get used on the opening and how to use them, but works well.\n* **Matador Travel Earplugs Kit**\n   * Just in case, it has a small pouch with keyring to keep the earplugs together.\n\n[Everything goes inside these two bags! Look at that session hoody shirt tho :\\)](https://preview.redd.it/wywmuxslq0ta1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41eed13be5fb6b8bc4cc009e81e495d4c48dddd9)\n\n# Tech\n\n* **Apple Macbook Air M1**\n   * As I said in the intro, I'm full into the Apple ecosystem. I've used MacBook for 12 years probably now so I'm just so used to these devices. But man, the M1 ones are amazing. The MBA still holds well even for editing big files. I'd possibly upgrade when M3 comes out.\n* **Apple iPhone 14 Pro**\n   * This is the best iPhone we've ever made. Wait, Tim Cook said that. But jk aside, it's just great. I upgraded to the 14 Pro because of the camera bump that's so great that became my second camera.\n* **Apple Watch Ultra**\n   * I haven't dived yet as I'm exploring big cities but can't wait to try the new features of this Apple Watch.\n* **Apple AirPods Pro 2**\n   * They are a big improvement for the 1st version: this one has sounds on the case and tracking of each pod if lost. I found one like that. Also has finger motion for volume.\n* **Apple Magsafe Duo**\n   * I love charging my phone via wireless charging and as I also have a watch, it just works well. Wish wasn't lightning tho.\n* **Apple Airtag**\n   * Must have if you have Apple stuff. Love to track all my things just in case.\n* **Aer Split Kit**\n   * This is my pouch to carry all the accessories for my tech. Small and very handful.\n* **Anker Powerport III 2-Port 65W**\n   * My go-to charger for all my devices. I seriously don't need more. I can charge other devices while my MBA is full.\n* **Anker USB-C Cable Bio-based 6ft**\n   * Good long cable for the Mac and other devices.\n* **Anker Lightning Cable Bio-based 3ft**\n   * Lightning for Magsafe and sometimes the iPhone. Hopefully we won't have to use these ones soon.\n* **Futurizta Pixy Go Portable Charger 10000**\n   * Small portable charger that has wireless charging for my iPhone, and usb-c for other stuff.\n* **Kikkerland Universal Travel Adapter**\n   * A portable adapter for any plug.\n* **uGreen SD Adapter**\n   * The only dongle I carry with me. I could even not use it if I connect my camera and other devices directly to usb, but it is just quicker with the dongle.\n* **Samsung SSD Portable T5 2TB**\n   * Next time I upgrade my Mac I'll get more space, but my current MBA has 1 TB of space and I thought it was enough. Fool me lol. Anyway, I carry this one for keep more files just in case.\n* **inCharge cable**\n   * Small cable with usb-c, usb-a and lightning. It's good to have just in case but I mostly use it to connect the SSD.\n* **Nintendo Switch OLED**\n   * Huge Nintendo fan (just saw Super Mario Bros movie and it was ok..) but loved the Switch ever since the first generation. Perfect for travelers like me.\n* **Tomtoc Switch Case for Nintendo Switch OLED**\n   * A perfect fit travel case for the switch.\n\n[Using all my tech gear in a coffee shop!](https://preview.redd.it/uhr9qi0f01ta1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86b2d5944e50679a1f5c99b46345a833eadfb782)\n\n# Filmmaking gear\n\n* **Sony Camera A7C**\n   * I used to have Canon but moved to Sony when I bought the A7C and now I can't look back. It's just a great camera overall, the smallest full frame. Might get the new ZV-E1 tho.\n* **Sony Shotgun Microphone ECM-B10**\n   * What I love about the Sony it's that really everything is compact and high quality such as this microphone. Connects directly to the camera.\n* **Tamron Lens 17-28mm f2.8**\n   * Smallest wide angle lens that I've found. I wish Sony had a G master lens with f2.8 this small tho.\n* **Sirui Tripod 3T-35**\n   * My main tripod for the camera, it's small enough to bring me at all times. Can act as a selfie camera too.\n* **Peak Design Travel Tripod Carbon Fiber**\n   * When I need higher shots, this travel tripod does the work wonderfully. Lightweight. Bit expensive but totally worth it.\n* **Moment ND Variable Filter 67mm**\n   * Just a good filter from the Moment brand when I need different stops of light.\n* **Peak Design Slide Lite Camera Strap**\n   * Very handful when I just want to carry the camera, so I put this strap and it's very secure.\n* **Peak Design Capture Clip**\n   * Added this Capture clip on the WANDRD backpack strap, so I can clip the camera.\n* **Peak Design Cuff handle**\n   * The same of this time I use the handle if I'm also carrying the Sirui Tripod.\n* **Neewer Dual Charger for Sony NP-FZ100**\n   * Just a small charger for two Sony batteries, it's usb-c.\n* **Insta360 X3**\n   * This small camera is really cool for different kind of shots; for sports, taking a scooter or walking around.\n* **GoPro Hero 8**\n   * The good ol' GoPro still works wonderful for activities like surfing or diving.\n* **DJI Drone Mini 3 Pro**\n   * The smallest DJI drone with the best quality. Got the Fly More Combo package that includes a remote with its own screen and battery charging case.\n* **Tenba BYOB 9 Camera Insert**\n   * I put all the drone stuff in here, fits perfectly.\n* **DJI Wireless Mic**\n   * My second audio device, specially when I recording on studio, walking around or different scenes. It can connect to the camera but also the iPhone or even the Insta360.\n* **Rode Lavalier GO**\n   * I use this lavalier with the DJI Wireless Mic when I wanna hide the mic.\n* **Rode Microphone Videomic Go II**\n   * This is my go-to for voiceovers, it connects via usb-c and it's very small.\n* **Ulanzi Extendable Handheld Tripod MT-08**\n   * I use this as the stand for the Rode microphone, also very small.\n* **VSGO Camera Cleaning Kit**\n   * Small cleaning kit, good to have.\n* **Alpaka Element Tech Case**\n   * I put all the camera accessories that I don't use that much in this bag, like the rode microphone (everything else fits on my WANDRD PRKE backpack)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[All filmmaking gear fits precisely in the WANDRD backpack](https://preview.redd.it/sp842afpg3ta1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fb3afb347aaf4ad0145e7aa61dc7a916a869c53)\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n* **Matador Pocket Blanket**\n   * Very packable blankets that fits 1-2 people. I take with me when I go to the beach or the park.\n* **Matador Droplet Water-Resistant Stuff Sack**\n   * Just a handful sack to protect my gear that's not waterproof\n* **Vapur Eclipse Flexible Water Bottle**\n   * Packable water bottle, great to travel. I take it everywhere!\n\n\\-----\n\nSo there you guys! Overall, this time I'm carrying 88 items and they can fit perfectly in those 2 bags I mentioned. Remember [I got a full video](https://youtu.be/avKRMrdl-1Q) explaining everything I just showed here, plus a link to a packing list tool from Pack Hacker.\n\nI hope this post was useful!",
