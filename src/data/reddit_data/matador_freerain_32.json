It's also nice that it packs down to basically nothing if you don't need it during your flight for example.\n\nTL;DR: I'm happy I bought it since I try to pack lightly but it's flexible enough to accomodate different loadouts. I imagine many people wouldn't like it since it has a bit of a techy and outdoorsy aesthetic and has no structure of its own. Also no padding or security for items inside.\n\nFeel free to ask me for further details.",

            "body": "***Preface***: this isn't a review, rather observations ive made comparing these 5 packable day bags in my quest to finding the right one for this next chapter of my travels. \n\n***Context***: I returned from 6 months in Latin America using a Matador free rain 22- it was outstanding when needed, however I didn't use it much over the 6 months and have been seeking a bag that fits these criteria: \n\n\\-Comfortable\n\n\\-Packable (smaller than the Free rain- bonus if it packs in its on pocket w/o needing an external bag like matador) \n\n\\-Water resistant/water proof\n\n\\-Durable\n\n*Anyway,My thoughts..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Matador Freerain22**\n\nIll start here since this is where im comparing what I've learned from using this bag. Its a fantastic back that is highly capable, incredibly durable, weather resistant, comfortable and packs down. The outer water bottle sleeves fit my 32oz Nalgene. It's come with me hiking volcanoes overnight in Guatemala, evening rainy walks in Costa Rica, and living in the amazon for a month where I was exposed to heavy downpours. I love this bag, however over 6 months of travel, I used it far less than I thought I would, and as I prepare for another 6-12 months in Latin America, id love something that takes up less of a footprint in my bag. And even a bigger bonus, something I can store in the pocket of my rain jacket or belt bag to deploy if/when needed. On my scale the bag weighs: 295g\n\n**Matador Freefly 16**\n\nThis bag is quite nice, there some things I really like compared to the freerain, however I could see other areas falling short. For reference, it weighs as much as the Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack (195g), and I would trust its water proofing abilities for what I would throw at it (being in the amazon, and being near waterfalls or on the boat while scuba diving) That said, the bag has the features I love about the Freerain; PU coated sealing zippers, the mesh straps, and more durable bag material ( compared to the osprey bags), while also packing smaller and having zipper access instead of roll-top which is easier/more accessible to use.. but.. theres some things going that im not crazy about. My 32oz Nalgene doesn't fit on the outer pockets unless really forced in there exposing the stitching, and the fact that I still need another sack to pack down the bag. Leading me to the Osprey bags. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack**\n\nI loved this bag when it first came in. It packs down into its own pocket, has a waterproof roll top, comfortable shoulder straps, fits my 32 oz Nalgene without forcing it in, and the pocket that the bag stuffs into is situation inside the waterproof compartment and can be used to put small necessities (chapstick, wallet, sunscreen etc.). I really dont have any complaints about this bag at all with the super limited time/use ive had with it so far. I still question how necessary the roll-top feature is in pack, however when I think on it more, while living in the amazon or being in very wet environments it was nice to have that peace of mind that it was never a concern on my mind. It packs smaller than the freerain, yet, for some reason I still want to bring my free rain lol, perhaps because I have it/cant return it, and the material is more durable of a rip stop and have no concern about any durability issues I may run into in the long run while abroad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Stuff Pack**\n\nAt first I wasn't a fan and thought it would be an instant return (compared to the other Osprey or freefly) given the lack of waterproofing on the zippers and pretty loose water bottle stretch pouch (whereas the other osprey has nylon straps to sinch down the bottle for added security). But I quite enjoy yet again having the zipper instead of the roll top. The bag is comfortable, packs down the lightest of the four mentioned thus far. the small accessory zipper separate from the man compartment zipper has enough room to fit quite a bit including a kindle oasis, wallet etc. \n\n*Honourable mention not pictured..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Day Pack** \n\nIm seriously impressed with how small it packs down, smaller than the palm of my hand and weighs around 85 grams. But its really a no frills type of bag which is why Ill be returning it after experiencing the Osprey and other Matador. The material feels nice for how thin it is. \n\nThat said, im still not sure which bag Ill be taking with me, I welcome any perspectives or opinions",

            "body": "***Preface***: this isn't a review, rather observations ive made comparing these 5 packable day bags in my quest to finding the right one for this next chapter of my travels. \n\n***Context***: I returned from 6 months in Latin America using a Matador free rain 22- it was outstanding when needed, however I didn't use it much over the 6 months and have been seeking a bag that fits these criteria: \n\n\\-Comfortable\n\n\\-Packable (smaller than the Free rain- bonus if it packs in its on pocket w/o needing an external bag like matador) \n\n\\-Water resistant/water proof\n\n\\-Durable\n\n*Anyway,My thoughts..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Matador Freerain22**\n\nIll start here since this is where im comparing what I've learned from using this bag. Its a fantastic back that is highly capable, incredibly durable, weather resistant, comfortable and packs down. The outer water bottle sleeves fit my 32oz Nalgene. It's come with me hiking volcanoes overnight in Guatemala, evening rainy walks in Costa Rica, and living in the amazon for a month where I was exposed to heavy downpours. I love this bag, however over 6 months of travel, I used it far less than I thought I would, and as I prepare for another 6-12 months in Latin America, id love something that takes up less of a footprint in my bag. And even a bigger bonus, something I can store in the pocket of my rain jacket or belt bag to deploy if/when needed. On my scale the bag weighs: 295g\n\n**Matador Freefly 16**\n\nThis bag is quite nice, there some things I really like compared to the freerain, however I could see other areas falling short. For reference, it weighs as much as the Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack (195g), and I would trust its water proofing abilities for what I would throw at it (being in the amazon, and being near waterfalls or on the boat while scuba diving) That said, the bag has the features I love about the Freerain; PU coated sealing zippers, the mesh straps, and more durable bag material ( compared to the osprey bags), while also packing smaller and having zipper access instead of roll-top which is easier/more accessible to use.. but.. theres some things going that im not crazy about. My 32oz Nalgene doesn't fit on the outer pockets unless really forced in there exposing the stitching, and the fact that I still need another sack to pack down the bag. Leading me to the Osprey bags. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Dry Stuff Pack**\n\nI loved this bag when it first came in. It packs down into its own pocket, has a waterproof roll top, comfortable shoulder straps, fits my 32 oz Nalgene without forcing it in, and the pocket that the bag stuffs into is situation inside the waterproof compartment and can be used to put small necessities (chapstick, wallet, sunscreen etc.). I really dont have any complaints about this bag at all with the super limited time/use ive had with it so far. I still question how necessary the roll-top feature is in pack, however when I think on it more, while living in the amazon or being in very wet environments it was nice to have that peace of mind that it was never a concern on my mind. It packs smaller than the freerain, yet, for some reason I still want to bring my free rain lol, perhaps because I have it/cant return it, and the material is more durable of a rip stop and have no concern about any durability issues I may run into in the long run while abroad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Osprey Ultralight Stuff Pack**\n\nAt first I wasn't a fan and thought it would be an instant return (compared to the other Osprey or freefly) given the lack of waterproofing on the zippers and pretty loose water bottle stretch pouch (whereas the other osprey has nylon straps to sinch down the bottle for added security). But I quite enjoy yet again having the zipper instead of the roll top. The bag is comfortable, packs down the lightest of the four mentioned thus far. the small accessory zipper separate from the man compartment zipper has enough room to fit quite a bit including a kindle oasis, wallet etc. \n\n*Honourable mention not pictured..*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Day Pack** \n\nIm seriously impressed with how small it packs down, smaller than the palm of my hand and weighs around 85 grams. But its really a no frills type of bag which is why Ill be returning it after experiencing the Osprey and other Matador. The material feels nice for how thin it is. \n\nThat said, im still not sure which bag Ill be taking with me, I welcome any perspectives or opinions",

            "body": "Picked up the Matador Beast18 at REI this weekend and got to take it out this Saturday for a nice 5-ish mile hike. \n\nFirst thing I‚Äôll address is the price. This pack is certainly on the higher end at $135. 20% for the REI Anniversary sale helped though. \n\nFor years I‚Äôve been using a CamelBak Mule as my primary day pack. It may be a bike focused pack, but the 12L size with 3L bladder has always worked well for me. But I have had a few times that I wanted a little more space, so I set out looking for an 18-22(ish)L pack. I also really preferred to use my existing bladder, which did narrow several options. \n\nPros of the Beast18: For me, the size is just right. I was able to carry my 3L bladder, a sizable lunch, running pants, a light jacket, and a raincoat with ease. It all fit nicely and carried very comfortably. The hip belt was the biggest surprise. Great load transfer, but it sits so nicely that I don‚Äôt even think about it being there. I personally love the layout, and there is very little that I would change. It also comes with a stuff sack so the bag can be folded down and carried. I don‚Äôt know how often I‚Äôll use that feature, but it‚Äôs nice to know that it exists. Comfort really is king with this back. The biggest complement that I can give is that if felt very similar to my Mule, and I never really had to think about it. Got it all adjusted before leaving, and never had to think about it or mess with it on the trail. We didn‚Äôt weigh it, but I did load it heavier than my wife‚Äôs 25L Osprey Sportlite, and she was stunned at how compact it was in comparison, especially when she lifted both packs to compare. \n\nPossible cons: I‚Äôm bringing these up because for some people they will be deal breakers. None of these things bothered me, but they are worth mentioning. \nWater bottle pockets are slim. I didn‚Äôt try to shove a standard Nalgene in, but if it does fit it would be tight. These pockets seem very specifically built for Smartwater bottles, or other tall and thin options. Nothing major, but worth noting. \n\nBladder Pocket: my Camelbak 3L Crux fit perfectly, but I‚Äôm not sure every 3L would. The bag width tapers from the shoulders to the hips, so a more rectangular bladder might not fit correctly. With anything smaller, it‚Äôs likely not going to be an issue, but if you carry 3L, it‚Äôs something to consider. \n\nNo shove it pocket: this is probably the number one thing I would change. Having a shove it pocket is nice. I didn‚Äôt need it on this trip, and I might not even need it. But I‚Äôd like it to be an option. The front does have loops down both sides, so I‚Äôll likely add some ties or webbing in the future, but I still think I‚Äôd prefer a shove it pocket. \n\nVenting: I prefer to have the pad on my back, but if you prefer trampoline backs you might notice this more. The bag doesn‚Äôt vent as well as some others I‚Äôve used. On the trail I didn‚Äôt notice it while hiking, but when I took the pack off I noticed that it was more damp than I was expecting. It does vent, but it‚Äôs a trade off for the pack abilities. I‚Äôd say it likely vents better than most packable packs, but a trampoline system will vent a lot more. Again, no issue for me, but others may feel differently. \n\nExcited to have this option in the mix and see how the pack holds up time, but so far I‚Äôm incredibly happy with this purchase!",

A few questions:\n\n\\- Do you have a stand for your ipad when using it as 2nd display?\n\n\\- How cold can you travel with this setup?  Seems like it would be good enough down to 50s but below that pretty chilly.\n\n\\- How do you find the backpack comfort?  My thought has always been that the backpack's main function is to be comfortable and going too light can make the overall setup ligher but less comfortable.  Hard to find a balance, even though most backpacks on this sub are way too heavy for what they are needed to do IMO.  How do you find this one?\n\n\\- I know you're not asking for suggestions but my mind immediately went to how to get this setup even lighter and more versatile for all temperatures. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the following changes:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Getting rid of apple watch, or swapping to a digital watch.  From your post, you said you don't really notice that you wear it, maybe it's not worth the charging / cables that it requires?\n* Do you need the external battery?  It's quite heavy.  I find since my laptop is already mostly a giant battery, it works well as a replacement for a battery for charging my phone and headphones.\n* I use an ipad mini for my external monitor and writing tablet and it's great.  Only around 300g too.\n* You could probably get away with fewer underwear and socks, but that's a personal choice and YMMV.  I travel with 3 underwear and 2 socks, same models / brands as you.  1 to wear, 1 to dry, 1 backup (underwear).  I'll wash the underwear daily in the shower and the socks every few days in the sink, works for me.\n* Sweatpants -&gt; Long underwear (uniqlo heat tech) can be lighter and worn under jeans for much more warmth.  Makes a huge difference.\n* Umbrella -&gt; Rain jacket: same idea, can be layered with hoody for more warmth.  Not as good in warm climates, but along with the long underwear and some gloves can probably allow you to travel down to freezing temps no problem.  Outdoor research helium 2 weighs around 170g and packs down small.\n* Flyknit / mesh shoes -&gt; Leather sneakers.  I've found my leather sneakers are comfortable for walking all day or running, look decent, and keep my feet reasonably warm down to below freezing temps even in wet / snowy conditions.  Might be more versatile, but less comfortable in hot temps.",

Most are too bulky for my taste.\n\nI use this gear for cold weather too, just a few days ago it was 20F and I still spent hours outside. But I think cold weather can be subjective, and there are many parts of the world that if I plan to visit I will definitely need to add something warmer to my bag.\n\nI've never heard that going too light makes a bag less comfortable. Maybe if you're using it as a source of warmth or protection? At least in my case, lighter is always more comfortable.\n\n&gt; how to get this setup even lighter\n\nProbably won't get rid of my watch because it's nice to have that retroactive health data if it's ever needed. The battery is definitely a necessity, since I sometimes go days without connecting to an outlet. 11\" iPad is the ideal size since for drawing you need an area for your hand to rest on.\n\n&gt; You could probably get away with fewer underwear and socks\n\nI've tried using fewer clothes, but no matter how well I plan eventually I'll hit a day when I need clean clothes asap and don't have them. Four is the number for me that I don't have that issue. I'm impressed that you can go lower!\n\n&gt; Sweatpants -&gt; Long underwear\n\nUsed trackpants last year, which are kind of similar? Went back to sweatpants because they're more comfortable and a bit better for wearing out in public.\n\n&gt; Umbrella -&gt; Rain jacket\n\nCarried a Helium II for years and basically never used it. But I think that's just personal taste, since logically a jacket would be the better choice as it's lighter and more versatile.\n\n&gt; Flyknit / mesh shoes -&gt; Leather sneakers\n\nMy shoes last year were Ecco GTX Tred leather sneakers, and I liked them for their waterproofing, but I think I walk too much for heavy shoes.

I hope to travel for at four to five years continuously and possibly longer, depending on my health and many things beyond my control.\n\nMy tentative plan includes SE Asia, South America, and a scattering of other countries, from India and Nepal to Georgia, Turkey, and some countries in Southern and Eastern Europe. I don‚Äôt expect to spend much time in places where the temperature is below freezing.\n\nI already own almost everything here -- I acquired the stuff gradually while one-bagging trips of 2-4 weeks over the past four years. Keep in mind that the list *includes* things I'll be wearing. I haven't listed the packing cubes and pouches I'll use.\n\nI‚Äôve been staring at this list too long, and would appreciate well-informed advice, especially from folks who‚Äôve travelled continuously for a year or longer. What am I missing? And what should I leave at home?\n\nThanks in advance for your comments.\n\nBAGS\n\nMain bag: Hiker from Filip Raboch in EXP400. (Pictured above.) Rolltop w/ side access zipper.

            "body": "Your list looks really good! I‚Äôm 6 months into a similar trip. Here are my thoughts based on my experience (if you‚Äôre interested in dropping some weight and getting more space.\n\n* Rolltop and bag size is great. Plenty of room for stuff, should fit under the seat, making your life easier, expands if you pick up food or things on the way.\n* Probably dont need so many EDC bags. I have a similar sized rolltop bag that I use for my main bag + daily carry / groceries / sightseeing with no problem.\n* Consider leaving pair of pants at home. They just take up a lot of space and are heavy relative to their use. If you want two pairs of pants, I'd recommend bring two that function differently instead of two of the same ones (eg a hiking pant + nicer looking pant or a comfy pant + more durable / warmer pant).\n* Consider leaving board shorts at home unless you plan to swim often. You can probably get by swimming in your regular shorts once in a while. I swim and have surfed in my \"one shorts\" (outlier new way shorts) whenever it comes up and it's been fine.\n* Consider bringing some Immodium or other stomach pills. Can be a lifesaver if you get sick and need to take a long bus ride or something.\n* I‚Äôd leave multi-tool at home, might get confiscated at airport, likely to be heavy, not very useful (in my experience). Pick one up if you find you need it for something specific on the way.\n* I have the same battery pack, it's great, but I've used it maybe twice in 6 months. Depending on how you use your battery and your activities, you might want to consider leaving it at home, I wish I had. most planes have outlets now. If you're hiking often though, probably worth the weight\n* Bring a headlamp for safety if you‚Äôll be hiking often.\n* Consider whether you need towel and dry bag, generally I found it to be sufficient to do laundry in sink / shower, and most accomidation have towels (or you can rent).\n* Related, could probably do away with some of the extra soap, have had no problem using soap at accommodation or just buying something cheap if there isn't any. Can be heavy and bulky, make security a pain.\n* Leave clothesline at home, hang on random stuff in your room.\n* Consider whether you‚Äôll actually use the resistance bands or consider bodyweight exercise / running instead (what I do),\n* I travel with an iPad mini which I use as a 2nd monitor, screen for movies on planes, notebook. I love it and it makes my life a lot better as I spend a lot of my time working on my laptop anyway.",

            "body": "wonderful list. Only things I would add would be ear plugs, sleeping mask, hat for sun,  and small headlamp (nitecore nu2\\* would be my choice).\n\nI carry a bluffworks hopscotch blazer... but that's because I periodically do events which require some sort of a suit / blazer. These days it's possible to get away with just a nice pair of slack and a button down shirt most places and I am wondering if I can get away without it for the next few seasons.\n\nI carry rain pants because I  do extended hikes in cool / rainy condition.\n\nThere is nothing which I would say \"needs to go\". Some minor tweaks I would make:\n\n* you could downsize to 1 pants / 1 shorts, but like you I bring 2 of each because I have had a number of situations where I really wanted to clean them and didn't have time to wash and dry them before my next engagement,\n* I wouldn't bother with the bum bag and consider if you really need the EDC... but that's a personal thing.\n* Unless you are staying in  hostels you can likely get away without a towel (a HG2G heresy)\n* unless you are staying in cheap hostels you could get away with not carrying soaps/shampoo. Otherwise I would replace soaps+shampoo with a 100 sense bar.\n* I wouldn't bother with clothing line unless you are regularly staying in dormitory style hostel.\n* I wouldn't bother with the dry bag unless either you are regularly staying in dormitory style hostel and/or regularly hiking in the extended rain and are using it to keep contents dry.\n* I wouldn't bother carrying the global entry card. I have never had a situation when it was useful beyond knowing the number when booking a flight.\n* take one pen, easy to aquire another\n* I wouldn't bother with the laptop base layer. I have carried a laptop without cover for more than 35 years without incident.\n* Tactica M-100 multi-tool is pretty cool... I would  ask if you actually need a universal wench or if that is an example of packing for fear.  My alternative is a tiny Swiss+Tech Utili-Key.\n* Do you currently use the bands?  If so, great.  Whatever works to keep fitness.  If just a theory, investigate pure bodyweight alternative.\n* not fond of crazy cap but alternatives all have tradeoffs as well. Are you in locations that need to treat the water yourself?\n* I would swap the henley for a fast dry technical tee for exercise... I find merino not so great when soaked in sweat.\n* why long sleeve synthetic in addition to henley? I bring a synthetic UPF 50+ because my light skin has burned through merino (typically around UPF 30) during all day hike in an intense sun.\n* Rather than a nano puff I have found I like a 90gsm alpha direct hoody + a down vest which will be warmer when combined with your shell than the nano puff, but also can also be effective as active insulation when highly active in cooler conditions.\n* First aid: tweezers... sometimes TSA will take them, even if tiny.  I dropped mine several years ago.  compeed blister bandaids are awesome.  single use superglue useful.",

You're probably right about the multi-tool -- packing for fear rather than need. The synthetic long-sleeve would be UPF 50+ for sun, and something to layer with a merino tee. The Henley's probably redundant, and swapping it for a fast-dry technical tee is a great idea.",
