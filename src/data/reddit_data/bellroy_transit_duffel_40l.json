Small wins!\n\nThis just might be my Goldilocks bag. It fits all my essentials for a week-ish trip (including shoes!) and doesn't make me look like a walking turtle (I'm 5'2\"). If I stay longer, I can mix and match everything to make new outfits without having to overpack.\n\nThe Patagonia Mini MLC is still my go-to for longer trips—I’m not giving it up anytime soon!\n\nI’m also bringing my Aimee Kestenberg Pouchette, which will double as my tech pouch while traveling.

            "body": "This will be my first trip with my new [Bellroy Transit Workpack Pro 22L](https://bellroy.com/products/transit-workpack-pro?color=black&amp;size=22l)! I thought about using my Patagonia Mini MLC, but for this short trip, it felt like a little overkill. (I included a bonus pic to show just how much extra space it has with everything I'm packing!)\n\nThe first and last days are travel days, but the first one includes a nice dinner, so I'll be wearing my travel clothes. The weather looks pretty mild, so I’m going with lightweight clothing and just layering if needed.\n\nMy boots and sandals are both Dr. Scholl's and heeled. I've gone on trips with them before where I can be walking around the city and my feet did just fine!\n\nSince I’ll be staying at a hotel, I’m keeping things easy and using their shampoo and conditioner instead of packing my own. Small wins!\n\nThis just might be my Goldilocks bag. It fits all my essentials for a week-ish trip (including shoes!) and doesn't make me look like a walking turtle (I'm 5'2\"). If I stay longer, I can mix and match everything to make new outfits without having to overpack.\n\nThe Patagonia Mini MLC is still my go-to for longer trips—I’m not giving it up anytime soon!\n\nI’m also bringing my Aimee Kestenberg Pouchette, which will double as my tech pouch while traveling. At night, it'll hold my lipstick, phone, and wallet. I’ll stash my tech in the backpack’s designated tech area when I head to the office.",

The 30L seems a good size with decent amount of storage. Laptop is protected by a stiff plate between it and the backpack straps. Backpack straps are nicely padded, nuch nore robust than their Lite ready packs.\n\nThe main compartment and top pocket zippers do not having locking loops on them, but the lower pocket and thr laptop pocket have a fanncy zipper where it can only be opened if the zipper is lifted up.\n\nThere's also an attachment loop top right of the bag, that lines with anothet loop bottom right of the bag, which would seem suggest a shoilder strap for duffel carry, but Bellroy doesn't supply such a strap.\n",

They were never super premium products but they were definitely better than average. What I’ve noticed is a decline in quality and materials. They’ve been moving away from leather for a while and I don’t like their new stuff. I have the A5 leather notebook and I love that thing so much, it looks and feels great. But if you compare that with their new offering of the Tokyo Folio, which just looks clunky and cheap and poorly made. It’s not sexy, sleek, or stylish. And the prices have stayed the same or gone up for lesser quality. Also a side note, their emails used to be gorgeous. I have reached out several times to them just to applaud their designer. But now they are stale, cookie cutter email templates. Just seems like they got too big and are cutting corners to maximize profits. Sorry for the long read.",

Mainly why you choose it over any other backpack, roller for travel, ect. \n\nI’m a healthcare worker that flys once a week and I’m usually carrying a bunch of medical supplies and expensive medications. I see patients some times in rural areas. These are day trips on short flights. \n\nI’m thinking in my head of having a duffel as a carryon but I really dislike the backpack straps that I’ve seen on a lot of the modern duffels like the Patagonia Black Hole. I won’t be doing any long distant walks by any means with the bag at all. A robust kind of roller seems ok also but the wheels might get slightly beat up. \n\nThanks in advance. \n\n(Pictures: Wanded Carryall Duffel)",

            "body": "I’m intrigued by this bag, honestly. The look leaves a little bit to be desired, but the functionality is what’s piqued my interest. My use case would be car travel and business travel by air. For business travel, I have to take a pair or two of dress shoes that I’ve put a lot of time and energy into shining properly and I refuse to check those so I always end up traveling with backpack, duffel, and carry-on suitcase that I check. Clothes in the carry-on, shoes in the duffel, work tech in the backpack. \n\nI have the Peak Design travel duffel 35L, and hate it. The carry handles are horrendous; the magnets don’t work at all, either to snap the carry handles together or to snap the bag’s sides down as advertised; and the bag itself has no real structure and sags down in the middle at the bottom like every other trash duffel I’ve had. The exterior pockets are fine, but not revolutionary. The only thing it does well is look really good. \n\nI’m not as triggered to immediately buy the EG TD35 as I’ve been to buy their CPLs, CTB26, and CAPs, but I’m leaning towards giving it the ol’ college try. I think with packing cubes, it’ll load beautifully and do exactly what I need it to do, but do it better than any other duffel I’ve tried. \n\nI do wish they’d given us the option to either load a laptop or use that panel as a luggage pass-through. A simple extra panel of 840D fabric on that exterior side would’ve given us the choice.",

PLC20 will be mainly for work, just EDC, and maybe for some light hikes. CPL24 is more for when I have a lot to carry to work, or when I’m going on a weekend trip somewhere. \n\nIn some ways I’m relieved I didn’t get the CTB26, it would’ve been far too big for EDC. I’m tempted to get it or the CHZ26 down the line, for one-bag travel, but I’ve spent enough for now! \n\nLove the patches and a CAP1 and a CAP2 are on their way. The build quality is out of this world and I love that they both use different materials for the shell, mixes things up. Although I do generally prefer the 840D on the CPL than the 1680D on the PLC. \n \nFor anyone on the fence - both amazing bags. It doesn’t bother me that there’s no dedicated laptop compartment, on the PLC, it is easy getting it in and out even when fully loaded. The one disappointing thing is the lack of a water bottle pouch. I know there are reasons for that, but still. \n\nOverall, so happy, can’t wait to start properly using them. If anyone wants to suggest whether I should get the CHZ or the CTB, for one-bag travel, that would be awesome 👌🏻 And if anyone who sees this has travelled with either bag, be it the ones I’ve bought or the CHZ26 or the CTB26, please let me know!",

It's not bad, it just didn't jive with me. The quick access pocket sort of blocked the access to the laptop pocket. However, I don't use it for a laptop, I store my Kindle back there. But I can only imagine it's worse with an actual laptop. Although the thought process behind it is \"folding\" the back in order to retrieve the laptop. \n\nThe QAP has the key fob in it and I found it to be inconvenient in my use case. I carry my sunglasses, pixel buds and a chico bag up in the QAP. So to have the keys in there too became a mess. I usually keep keys in my pocket unless I'm traveling and that never happened while having this backpack cause I returned it so fast able to snag the CTB26 that had dropped two weeks after I purchased the CHZ26. 😂😂\n\nI originally bought the CHZ26 because, on paper, I really disliked clamshell backpacks, but I find them quite convenient now that I've had the CTB26 for 6 months. I guess I thought the main pocket would just open entirely if part of the zipper remain opened? But if I have the backpack on my desk, I can just open part of it if I know where the item I need would be located....which is usually just at the bottom.\n\nMy EDC is ridiculously small, though...in the main area I carry a generic pencil case, 2 cap2s, a moleskine, kindle, taco pouch from JanSport and another generic pouch. I have a lot of space available for other stuff and interestingly enough, it doesn't slouch, it keeps it's shape for the most part. \n\nI love that the keyfob on the CTB26 is in the front pocket instead of the QAP, and that the laptop has its own access. \nThe materials are different too. The chz26 is more coarse whereas the CTB26 is shinier. The rest of the pockets are just absolutely magic, I forget all the stuff I have in them 😂",

What I will say is that initially I thought the CPL24 was too big. Like, I got it out of the box it arrived in, and immediately thought \"this is way too big for my EDC needs\". \n\nBut then I tried it on, and it didn't look weird on me (bearing in mind I'm 6 foot 2 guy, 188cm for anyone not using imperial). And as I started loading things into it, knowing I could carefully try it out at home and return if needed to the store, I started realising that it's actually a great size for my EDC needs. And once I had filled it - more or less - I fell in love with it, and hence have chosen it for this trip over the PLC. \n\nThe main compartment is very roomy. As you probably have seen, it has a mesh section at the back, and two internal pockets. It is a big space, I easily have a large and thick jumper in there, two CAP2s, snacks, documents etc. The two internal pockets are great, especially the top one, although it's small, it's very easy to access. The second internal pocket is a little trickier as it opens from the side, and can be hard when the bag is full, but it is far roomier than the top internal pocket. \n\nOtherwise, having the dedicated laptop sleeve is amazing. It feels so protective, and there is a very decent amount of space on the other side of the divider in that section for documents, or just anything flat you want hidden away. It made it so easy at the airport the other day, laptop was out of my bag and in the tray in like 5 seconds. But it's also handy, of course, day-to-day. The PLC doesn't have that, and I'll get to it in a moment. \n\nOtherwise, with the CPL24, the top pocket is very deep and doesn't interfere with the internals of the bag, I can quite easily fit my Airpods, keys, a pack of travel tissues, and sunglasses in there. Finally, the front compartment is so amazing for organisation, and that's something the PLC doesn't have. \n\nAnyway, sorry, you probably knew all of that. I truly love the CPL24, it just is a big investment, but if you're able, I'd recommend ordering one from somewhere that accepts returns, so you can at least try it on at home, even with a few things carefully put in there, just to try it out. It isn't a $50 bag! \n\nIn terms of sizing, comparing them, the CPL24 is definitely bigger. From memory it is taller and deeper. But they are different bags - if you don't carry much as EDC, the PLC may be the right pick. It is much more portable than the CPL24, in my opinion, but even the CPL24 fit under the airplane seat, so it isn't huge. \n\nThe main issue I have with the PLC is just that it lacks a lot of internal storage. Sure, there are internal pockets and the front dump pocket, but it just doesn't have that same level of organisation as the CPL24. Having said that, if you just get a CAP2, maybe two of them, and have those in the main compartment, along with a CAP1 in the front dump pocket (it confirmed fits), then you'd have plenty of organisation. \n\nI think if you are someone who travels with documents, snacks, maybe lunch or dinner in a container, keys, sunglasses, other small things, an iPad or tablet that is fairly small (I don't have one so unsure what sizes would fit), medicines, and a 14-15\" laptop, the PLC would be great. I have used it for that purpose and it was fine. But that was just getting to and from work, whereas this time I've opted for the CPL24 for a week-long trip. \n\nBut really, the PLC is amazing value, it is such high quality, same as all Evergoods stuff, the zippers feel amazing, the fabric feels so sturdy, the black version I've got looks super cool (I do prefer the nylon used on the CPL24 though, it is more matte whereas on the PLC it is a little shinier), and if you can get around the fact it doesn't have many organisation options, it's a great bag, hands down. \n\nThe only real downsides are the lack of water bottle holders (on both the PLC and the CPL24) and, if this matters to you, the lack of dedicated laptop compartment on the PLC. Having said that, I've taken the PLC out for a day, with a fair bit in it and my Macbook, and getting my Macbook in and out wasn't hard. Harder than with the CPL24, naturally, but not annoying or anything. It is easy to access, again, unless you have the bag stuffed full. I guess it will depend on a) whether you take your laptop with you as EDC and b) how big it is. \n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts. In Australia, it was significantly cheaper to get the PLC than the CPL24, I'm not sure if it's the same where you live, and I don't know if price is an issue for you. The main point is that the CPL24 is, of course, bigger, but not by much, and having now travelled with it - including putting it under the airplane seat, taking it through security, doing 20,000 steps with it on my back, accessing the pockets over and over each day etc - I love it. And I could easily use it for EDC, it wouldn't be too big for that. \n\nBut I will continue using the PLC for EDC, I think, just because it fits all I need for my work, is easier to transport, is still outstanding quality, and the two downsides - no laptop compartment and no water bottle holders - aren't that big of a deal. The laptop is easy to get in and out, and for my EDC I would never have the bag stuffed full, and I can easily fit a 1L water bottle in the main compartment of the PLC (and the CPL24, for that matter). Basically, day-to-day, in my opinion, and in my experience, the extra room and laptop compartment in the CPL24 don't make up for the fact that it's a bigger bag. Which means it's less portable, which means it's inherently \"more bag\" to take around for your EDC. \n\nIf you want an in-between option, you could look at the CHZ22, I'm just not a huge fan of that aesthetic, and I think it's crumples easily and looks weird when not full. Whereas I certainly haven't had that problem with the CPL24 - but the PLC does look a little weird when empty. Particularly when you have things in the top internal pocket, and nothing else in the bag, but that's a \"me thing\", I have to carry medicines wherever I go (for my ADHD), so that pocket is always full with those. \n\nTough decision though - hence me buying both 😂 But I spent months agonising, I just couldn't decide, and naturally it was a big financial outlay (around 500 USD). I love them both, they both have their own uses, and I'm so happy I have both. But yes, the CPL24 isn't huge, not at all, and it's been fine for this trip I'm on. And if you're really concerned it'll be too similar to your 26L GR1, go for the PLC. You'd save a lot of money, and still end up with an outstanding, extremely high quality bag, that is so portable and timeless. \n\nAnd as I said, if you can, either try it on in-store, or order from somewhere that does free returns. The only way I could properly know how big each of these bags were was when they arrived in the mail and I tried them on. And that is so subjective, for some people who are smaller than me, the CPL24 might be way, way too big for EDC, and they would just never buy it and get the PLC. Other people who are taller or bigger might even go for the CTB26 for EDC. It's just subjective, so I hope it works out for you! Let me know if you have any questions. \n\nSorry this was so long, I just want to help you if I can, as I was in a similar position to you. My dilemma was that I had a Bellroy Transit Workpack and a Transit Backpack (20L and 28L respectively)... great bags, but I just wanted \"more\". If you do get the CPL24, or if you haven't gotten it, I'd say definitely go with black for the colour, if that's your thing. Normally I dislike black blacks and things generally, but it's this beautiful ballistic nylon, and isn't shiny. Whereas the PLC uses a different nylon and is a bit shinier. Still a really nice look, in hindsight I kinda wish I'd gotten the sage colour for the PLC, just to make things more interesting! Black CPL24, black PLC, black CAP2s and CAP1s, black Bellroy Venture Sling. Ah well.",

                "body": "I'm currently on a one-week trip with the CPL, loving it! It's the perfect size of this use. For EDC... I think I can comfortably swap between the CPL and the PLC, as you do. Sadly the MPL22 isn't available where I live (Australia) yet... which sucks. I mean, I just got the PLC, but having looked a the MPL22 before I bought these bags, I was like damnnnn... that's a nice bag. \n\nAnyway, still super super happy with both the CPL and the PLC, such incredible quality, it surpasses any bag I've ever used. And I absolutely adore the black on the CPL24, the V3, it is just such a classic, stylish, sleek, modern yet... almost Batman-ish, it's just a really cool looking bag, the nylon has been done perfectly. I'm less of a fan of the black on the PLC, but it's still a really nice looking bag. \n\nPart of me wishes I'd gotten the sage colour, for the PLC, which was available, but black is timeless, I guess, and of course, shows up stains much less. Orange was also available for the CPL, and the place I got the bags from were selling that orange version for like a hundred dollars less, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it, it's just such an intense colour. And for a $450 AUD backpack I wanted to get exactly what I wanted, hence black. \n\nBy the way, do you use anything for internal organisation for the PLC? I have a few CAP2 and a CAP1 that I use, it's my one issue with the bag. That front dump pocket could have so many options for customisation. But, I guess, they intended it to be a pocket you could just throw stuff into, adding zips and compartments etc would ruin that. Hence me keeping a CAP1 in there, which helps.  I also wish that the top pocket was deeper, I know it intrudes into the main compartment, but it's barely even deep enough to fit my sunglasses, let alone my Airpods and other things I want quick access to. Whereas on the CPL I can fit everything in that top pocket.",

                "body": "Hey! It is a great setup. I'm currently on a one-week trip with the CPL24, loving it, it's an amazing bag. And I have a very similar usage to you. But I agree... I am an avid hiker, I'm always going on hikes, and the PLC20 just isn't fully cutting it for that purpose. On the whole, I love the bag, and I use it for my EDC with no real issues (just have to use a few CAP2s and CAP1s to make it a bit more organised - ADHD means I have to have everything organised, or I will lose it, guaranteed 😅). \n\nBut yeah, when I'm on a seven or eight hour hike with my partner, the lack of water bottle holders is a nightmare, and it isn't really big enough for a few rain jackets if needed, two big water bottles (given the length of our hikes), plus lunch/snacks/sunscreen/bathers/whatever. I wish the MPL22 was available in Australia, it just isn't yet which sucks. And being Australia, it can be extremely hot in summer, depending on where you are, so breathability also plays a part (haven't had any issues with the padding on the PLC though, it seems to be the same as the CPL24?). \n\nThe CHZ22 is available, it just isn't really my style. I may get the CHZ26 for one-bag travel, but I don't know. If money grew on trees, I would just go out and buy the CTB26 for one-bag travel. I absolutely adore that backpack, and I've never even seen one in-person! The water bottle pockets, the front compartment, the organisation, plus the size being appropriate for one-bag travel... having seen packing demonstrations, I could definitely pack one or even two weeks of vacation clothes into it. Anyway, that can wait, I just can't go and spend another 300 USD on a bag. Hence me partly considering the CHZ26 as it is much cheaper here than the CTB26. But - as you know - it is considered by many to be worse than the CTB26, some people have told me to avoid the CHZ26 no matter what. Who knows \n\nThis current trip, I have my Patagonia Black Hole duffel with me (40L), as a check-in bag, so I'm not using the CPL24 only! But it was a breeze through security with the laptop compartment, and it was able to fit under the seat in front of me on the plane (it was a 737, unsure how I'll go with the smaller planes that I often get when travelling rurally). \n\nI need to order some packing cubes from Evergoods, again, it's just expensive. I feel like I've blown all this money on these two amazing bags, but now need to get even more expensive stuff. Like the CAP1s and CAP2s were insanely expensive! Amazing quality, but jeez, 80 USD for a tiny little pocket like the CAP1. Anyway. \n\nOverall very happy with the two bags, glad to be part of the Evergoods family, and honestly, *maybe* I'll get the MPL22 if it becomes available here, maybe one day I'll get the CTB26, but for now I have all that I need. If the PLC20 had even one water bottle pocket, it would be the perfect bag, along with a little more organisation. But it is what it is, Kevin and Jack know what they're doing, they do it very well, and they do it whilst considering so many things. So I'm sure there's a reason there's no water bottle pocket/s on the bags (I think they answered why somewhere but I can't find it).",
